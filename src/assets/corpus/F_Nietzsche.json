    "FROM THE HEIGHTS (POEM TRANSLATED BY L.A. MAGNUS) PREFACE SUPPOSING that Truth is a woman--what then?",
    "Is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists, have failed to understand women--that the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman?",
    "Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien--IF, indeed, it stands at all!",
    "For there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground--nay more, that it is at its last gasp.",
    "But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition, which, in the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception on the part of grammar, or an audacious generalization of very restricted, very personal, very human--all-too-human facts.",
    "The philosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be hoped, was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology in still earlier times, in the service of which probably more labour, gold, acuteness, and patience have been spent than on any actual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to its \"super-terrestrial\" pretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of architecture.",
    "It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things have first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature of this kind--for instance, the Vedanta doctrine in Asia, and Platonism in Europe.",
    "Let us not be ungrateful to it, although it must certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome, and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist error--namely, Plato's invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself.",
    "But now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of this nightmare, can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier--sleep, we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the heirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error has fostered.",
    "It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the denial of the PERSPECTIVE--the fundamental condition--of life, to speak of Spirit and the Good as Plato spoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: \"How did such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato?",
    "Had the wicked Socrates really corrupted him?",
    "Was Socrates after all a corrupter of youths, and deserved his hemlock?\"",
    "But the struggle against Plato, or--to speak plainer, and for the \"people\"--the struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity (FOR CHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE \"PEOPLE\"), produced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals.",
    "As a matter of fact, the European feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice attempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow: once by means of Jesuitism, and the second time by means of democratic enlightenment--which, with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it about that the spirit would not so easily find itself in \"distress\"!",
    "(The Germans invented gunpowder--all credit to them!",
    "but they again made things square--they invented printing.)",
    "But we, who are neither Jesuits, nor democrats, nor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD EUROPEANS, and free, VERY free spirits--we have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow!",
    "And perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and, who knows?",
    "THE GOAL TO AIM AT....",
    "Sils Maria Upper Engadine, JUNE, 1885.",
    "CHAPTER I. PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 1.",
    "The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not laid before us!",
    "What strange, perplexing, questionable questions!",
    "It is already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced.",
    "Is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away?",
    "That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves?",
    "WHO is it really that puts questions to us here?",
    "WHAT really is this \"Will to Truth\" in us?",
    "In fact we made a long halt at the question as to the origin of this Will--until at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question.",
    "We inquired about the VALUE of this Will.",
    "Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT RATHER untruth?",
    "And uncertainty?",
    "Even ignorance?",
    "The problem of the value of truth presented itself before us--or was it we who presented ourselves before the problem?",
    "Which of us is the Oedipus here?",
    "Which the Sphinx?",
    "It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation.",
    "And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it?",
    "For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.",
    "2. \"HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite?",
    "For example, truth out of error?",
    "or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception?",
    "or the generous deed out of selfishness?",
    "or the pure sun-bright vision of the wise man out of covetousness?",
    "Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams of it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest value must have a different origin, an origin of THEIR own--in this transitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source.",
    "But rather in the lap of Being, in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the 'Thing-in-itself--THERE must be their source, and nowhere else!\"--This mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation is at the back of all their logical procedure; through this \"belief\" of theirs, they exert themselves for their \"knowledge,\" for something that is in the end solemnly christened \"the Truth.\"",
    "The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES.",
    "It never occurred even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold (where doubt, however, was most necessary); though they had made a solemn vow, \"DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM.\"",
    "For it may be doubted, firstly, whether antitheses exist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their seal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely provisional perspectives, besides being probably made from some corner, perhaps from below--\"frog perspectives,\" as it were, to borrow an expression current among painters.",
    "In spite of all the value which may belong to the true, the positive, and the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to pretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity.",
    "It might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and respected things, consists precisely in their being insidiously related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed things--perhaps even in being essentially identical with them.",
    "Perhaps!",
    "But who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous \"Perhapses\"!",
    "For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of philosophers, such as will have other tastes and inclinations, the reverse of those hitherto prevalent--philosophers of the dangerous \"Perhaps\" in every sense of the term.",
    "And to speak in all seriousness, I see such new philosophers beginning to appear.",
    "3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between their lines long enough, I now say to myself that the greater part of conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here to learn anew, as one learned anew about heredity and \"innateness.\"",
    "As little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity, just as little is \"being-conscious\" OPPOSED to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his instincts, and forced into definite channels.",
    "And behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak more plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite mode of life For example, that the certain is worth more than the uncertain, that illusion is less valuable than \"truth\" such valuations, in spite of their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be only superficial valuations, special kinds of _niaiserie_, such as may be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves.",
    "Supposing, in effect, that man is not just the \"measure of things.\"",
    "4.",
    "The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely.",
    "The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable, without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not live--that the renunciation of false opinions would be a renunciation of life, a negation of life.",
    "TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.",
    "5. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they are--how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in short, how childish and childlike they are,--but that there is not enough honest dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner.",
    "They all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure, divinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics, who, fairer and foolisher, talk of \"inspiration\"), whereas, in fact, a prejudiced proposition, idea, or \"suggestion,\" which is generally their heart's desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with arguments sought out after the event.",
    "They are all advocates who do not wish to be regarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their prejudices, which they dub \"truths,\"--and VERY far from having the conscience which bravely admits this to itself, very far from having the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be understood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful confidence and self-ridicule.",
    "The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic by-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his \"categorical imperative\"--makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical preachers.",
    "Or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by means of which Spinoza has, as it were, clad his philosophy in mail and mask--in fact, the \"love of HIS wisdom,\" to translate the term fairly and squarely--in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible maiden, that Pallas Athene:--how much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!",
    "6.",
    "It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has consisted of--namely, the confession of its originator, and a species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover that the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown.",
    "Indeed, to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first ask oneself: \"What morality do they (or does he) aim at?\"",
    "Accordingly, I do not believe that an \"impulse to knowledge\" is the father of philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument.",
    "But whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate LORD over all the other impulses.",
    "For every impulse is imperious, and as SUCH, attempts to philosophize.",
    "To be sure, in the case of scholars, in the case of really scientific men, it may be otherwise--\"better,\" if you will; there there may really be such a thing as an \"impulse to knowledge,\" some kind of small, independent clock-work, which, when well wound up, works away industriously to that end, WITHOUT the rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein.",
    "The actual \"interests\" of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another direction--in the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics; it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that.",
    "In the philosopher, on the contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all, his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HE IS,--that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature stand to each other.",
    "7.",
    "How malicious philosophers can be!",
    "I know of nothing more stinging than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes.",
    "In its original sense, and on the face of it, the word signifies \"Flatterers of Dionysius\"--consequently, tyrants' accessories and lick-spittles; besides this, however, it is as much as to say, \"They are all ACTORS, there is nothing genuine about them\" (for Dionysiokolax was a popular name for an actor).",
    "And the latter is really the malignant reproach that Epicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were masters--of which Epicurus was not a master!",
    "He, the old school-teacher of Samos, who sat concealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three hundred books, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who knows!",
    "Greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-god Epicurus really was.",
    "Did she ever find out?",
    "8.",
    "There is a point in every philosophy at which the \"conviction\" of the philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the words of an ancient mystery: Adventavit asinus, Pulcher et fortissimus.",
    "9. You desire to LIVE \"according to Nature\"?",
    "Oh, you noble Stoics, what fraud of words!",
    "Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain: imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power--how COULD you live in accordance with such indifference?",
    "To live--is not that just endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature?",
    "Is not living valuing, preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different?",
    "And granted that your imperative, \"living according to Nature,\" means actually the same as \"living according to life\"--how could you do DIFFERENTLY?",
    "Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be?",
    "In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature, you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders!",
    "In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist that it shall be Nature \"according to the Stoa,\" and would like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal glorification and generalism of Stoicism!",
    "With all your love for truth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically, that you are no longer able to see it otherwise--and to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves--Stoicism is self-tyranny--Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic a PART of Nature?...",
    "But this is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself.",
    "It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will to \"creation of the world,\" the will to the causa prima.",
    "10.",
    "The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness, with which the problem of \"the real and the apparent world\" is dealt with at present throughout Europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and he who hears only a \"Will to Truth\" in the background, and nothing else, cannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears.",
    "In rare and isolated cases, it may really have happened that such a Will to Truth--a certain extravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician's ambition of the forlorn hope--has participated therein: that which in the end always prefers a handful of \"certainty\" to a whole cartload of beautiful possibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience, who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an uncertain something.",
    "But that is Nihilism, and the sign of a despairing, mortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a virtue may display.",
    "It seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life.",
    "In that they side AGAINST appearance, and speak superciliously of \"perspective,\" in that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the credibility of the ocular evidence that \"the earth stands still,\" and thus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession to escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly than in one's body?),--who knows if they are not really trying to win back something which was formerly an even securer possession, something of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the \"immortal soul,\" perhaps \"the old God,\" in short, ideas by which they could live better, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by \"modern ideas\"?",
    "There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this mode of looking at things, a disbelief in all that has been constructed yesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn, which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the most varied origin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws on the market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair motleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom there is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness.",
    "Therein it seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists and knowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels them from MODERN reality, is unrefuted... what do their retrograde by-paths concern us!",
    "The main thing about them is NOT that they wish to go \"back,\" but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom.",
    "A little MORE strength, swing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be OFF--and not back!",
    "11.",
    "It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself.",
    "Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table of Categories; with it in his hand he said: \"This is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\"",
    "Let us only understand this \"could be\"!",
    "He was proud of having DISCOVERED a new faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori.",
    "Granting that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible something--at all events \"new faculties\"--of which to be still prouder!--But let us reflect for a moment--it is high time to do so.",
    "\"How are synthetic judgments a priori POSSIBLE?\"",
    "Kant asks himself--and what is really his answer?",
    "\"BY MEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)\"--but unfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of German profundity and verbal flourishes, that one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer.",
    "People were beside themselves with delight over this new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further discovered a moral faculty in man--for at that time Germans were still moral, not yet dabbling in the \"Politics of hard fact.\"",
    "Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy.",
    "All the young theologians of the Tubingen institution went immediately into the groves--all seeking for \"faculties.\"",
    "And what did they not find--in that innocent, rich, and still youthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, the malicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish between \"finding\" and \"inventing\"!",
    "Above all a faculty for the \"transcendental\"; Schelling christened it, intellectual intuition, and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally pious-inclined Germans.",
    "One can do no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness, notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and senile conceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with moral indignation.",
    "Enough, however--the world grew older, and the dream vanished.",
    "A time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still rub them today.",
    "People had been dreaming, and first and foremost--old Kant.",
    "\"By means of a means (faculty)\"--he had said, or at least meant to say.",
    "But, is that--an answer?",
    "An explanation?",
    "Or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question?",
    "How does opium induce sleep?",
    "\"By means of a means (faculty),\" namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in Moliere, Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva, Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.",
    "But such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time to replace the Kantian question, \"How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI possible?\" by another question, \"Why is belief in such judgments necessary?\"--in effect, it is high time that we should understand that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might naturally be false judgments!",
    "Or, more plainly spoken, and roughly and readily--synthetic judgments a priori should not \"be possible\" at all; we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false judgments.",
    "Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view of life.",
    "And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which \"German philosophy\"--I hope you understand its right to inverted commas (goosefeet)?--has exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to German philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, the mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the political obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the still overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into this, in short--\"sensus assoupire.",
    "\"... 12.",
    "As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means of expression)--thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of ocular evidence.",
    "For while Copernicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that \"stood fast\" of the earth--the belief in \"substance,\" in \"matter,\" in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth.",
    "One must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war to the knife, against the \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a dangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more celebrated \"metaphysical requirements\": one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM.",
    "Let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science!",
    "Between ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of \"the soul\" thereby, and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses--as happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it.",
    "But the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as \"mortal soul,\" and \"soul of subjective multiplicity,\" and \"soul as social structure of the instincts and passions,\" want henceforth to have legitimate rights in science.",
    "In that the NEW psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into a new desert and a new distrust--it is possible that the older psychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT--and, who knows?",
    "perhaps to DISCOVER the new.",
    "13.",
    "Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being.",
    "A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its strength--life itself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent RESULTS thereof.",
    "In short, here, as everywhere else, let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!--one of which is the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to Spinoza's inconsistency).",
    "It is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must be essentially economy of principles.",
    "14.",
    "It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according to us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far as it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long time to come must be regarded as more--namely, as an explanation.",
    "It has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes--in fact, it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism.",
    "What is clear, what is \"explained\"?",
    "Only that which can be seen and felt--one must pursue every problem thus far.",
    "Obversely, however, the charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode, consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence--perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses--the mob of the senses, as Plato said.",
    "In this overcoming of the world, and interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT different from that which the physicists of today offer us--and likewise the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workers, with their principle of the \"smallest possible effort,\" and the greatest possible blunder.",
    "\"Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp, there is also nothing more for men to do\"--that is certainly an imperative different from the Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right imperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-builders of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform.",
    "15.",
    "To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes!",
    "Sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as heuristic principle.",
    "What?",
    "And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs?",
    "But then our body, as a part of this external world, would be the work of our organs!",
    "But then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs!",
    "It seems to me that this is a complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the conception CAUSA SUI is something fundamentally absurd.",
    "Consequently, the external world is NOT the work of our organs--?",
    "16.",
    "There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are \"immediate certainties\"; for instance, \"I think,\" or as the superstition of Schopenhauer puts it, \"I will\"; as though cognition here got hold of its object purely and simply as \"the thing in itself,\" without any falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the object.",
    "I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that \"immediate certainty,\" as well as \"absolute knowledge\" and the \"thing in itself,\" involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words!",
    "The people on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the philosopher must say to himself: \"When I analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring assertions, the argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps impossible: for instance, that it is _I_ who think, that there must necessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,' and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinking--that I KNOW what thinking is.",
    "For if I had not already decided within myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps 'willing' or 'feeling'?",
    "In short, the assertion 'I think,' assumes that I COMPARE my state at the present moment with other states of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with further 'knowledge,' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for me.",
    "\"--In place of the \"immediate certainty\" in which the people may believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable conscience questions of the intellect, to wit: \"Whence did I get the notion of 'thinking'?",
    "Why do I believe in cause and effect?",
    "What gives me the right to speak of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally of an 'ego' as cause of thought?\"",
    "He who ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like the person who says, \"I think, and know that this, at least, is true, actual, and certain\"--will encounter a smile and two notes of interrogation in a philosopher nowadays.",
    "\"Sir,\" the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand, \"it is improbable that you are not mistaken, but why should it be the truth?\"",
    "17.",
    "With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire of emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by these credulous minds--namely, that a thought comes when \"it\" wishes, and not when \"I\" wish; so that it is a PERVERSION of the facts of the case to say that the subject \"I\" is the condition of the predicate \"think.\"",
    "ONE thinks; but that this \"one\" is precisely the famous old \"ego,\" is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an \"immediate certainty.\"",
    "After all, one has even gone too far with this \"one thinks\"--even the \"one\" contains an INTERPRETATION of the process, and does not belong to the process itself.",
    "One infers here according to the usual grammatical formula--\"To think is an activity; every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently\"...",
    "It was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought, besides the operating \"power,\" the material particle wherein it resides and out of which it operates--the atom.",
    "More rigorous minds, however, learnt at last to get along without this \"earth-residuum,\" and perhaps some day we shall accustom ourselves, even from the logician's point of view, to get along without the little \"one\" (to which the worthy old \"ego\" has refined itself).",
    "18.",
    "It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds.",
    "It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the \"free will\" owes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to refute it.",
    "19.",
    "Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and completely known, without deduction or addition.",
    "But it again and again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing--he seems to have adopted a POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it.",
    "Willing seems to me to be above all something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity only in name--and it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages.",
    "So let us for once be more cautious, let us be \"unphilosophical\": let us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations, namely, the sensation of the condition \"AWAY FROM WHICH we go,\" the sensation of the condition \"TOWARDS WHICH we go,\" the sensation of this \"FROM\" and \"TOWARDS\" itself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular sensation, which, even without our putting in motion \"arms and legs,\" commences its action by force of habit, directly we \"will\" anything.",
    "Therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place, thinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there is a ruling thought;--and",
    "let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the \"willing,\" as if the will would then remain over!",
    "In the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in fact the emotion of the command.",
    "That which is termed \"freedom of the will\" is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: \"I am free, 'he' must obey\"--this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so the straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that \"this and nothing else is necessary now,\" the inward certainty that obedience will be rendered--and whatever else pertains to the position of the commander.",
    "A man who WILLS commands something within himself which renders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience.",
    "But now let us notice what is the strangest thing about the will,--this affair so extremely complex, for which the people have only one name.",
    "Inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term \"I\": a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the will itself, has become attached to the act of willing--to such a degree that he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action.",
    "Since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the command--consequently obedience, and therefore action--was to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success.",
    "\"Freedom of Will\"--that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order--who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that overcame them.",
    "In this way the person exercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful \"underwills\" or under-souls--indeed, our body is but a social structure composed of many souls--to his feelings of delight as commander.",
    "L'EFFET C'EST MOI.",
    "what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed and happy commonwealth, namely, that the governing class identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth.",
    "In all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as already said, of a social structure composed of many \"souls\", on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such within the sphere of morals--regarded as the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of \"life\" manifests itself.",
    "20.",
    "That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with each other, that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as the collective members of the fauna of a Continent--is betrayed in the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme of POSSIBLE philosophies.",
    "Under an invisible spell, they always revolve once more in the same orbit, however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something within them leads them, something impels them in definite order the one after the other--to wit, the innate methodology and relationship of their ideas.",
    "Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off, ancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly grew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order.",
    "The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and German philosophizing is easily enough explained.",
    "In fact, where there is affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of grammar--I mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical functions--it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems, just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of world-interpretation.",
    "It is highly probable that philosophers within the domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the subject is least developed) look otherwise \"into the world,\" and will be found on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans and Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.--So much by way of rejecting Locke's superficiality with regard to the origin of ideas.",
    "21.",
    "The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly.",
    "The desire for \"freedom of will\" in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing less than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the slough of nothingness.",
    "If any one should find out in this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of \"free will\" and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry his \"enlightenment\" a step further, and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of \"free will\": I mean \"non-free will,\" which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect.",
    "One should not wrongly MATERIALISE \"cause\" and \"effect,\" as the natural philosophers do (and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at present), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it \"effects\" its end; one should use \"cause\" and \"effect\" only as pure CONCEPTIONS, that is to say, as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual understanding,--NOT for explanation.",
    "In \"being-in-itself\" there is nothing of \"casual-connection,\" of \"necessity,\" or of \"psychological non-freedom\"; there the effect does NOT follow the cause, there \"law\" does not obtain.",
    "It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence, reciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world, as \"being-in-itself,\" with things, we act once more as we have always acted--MYTHOLOGICALLY.",
    "The \"non-free will\" is mythology; in real life it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.--It is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every \"causal-connection\" and \"psychological necessity,\" manifests something of compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom; it is suspicious to have such feelings--the person betrays himself.",
    "And in general, if I have observed correctly, the \"non-freedom of the will\" is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some will not give up their \"responsibility,\" their belief in THEMSELVES, the personal right to THEIR merits, at any price (the vain races belong to this class); others on the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS, no matter how.",
    "The latter, when they write books, are in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort of socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise.",
    "And as a matter of fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose as \"la religion de la souffrance humaine\"; that is ITS \"good taste.\"",

    "Let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot desist from the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation, but \"Nature's conformity to law,\" of which you physicists talk so proudly, as though--why, it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad \"philology.\"",
    "It is no matter of fact, no \"text,\" but rather just a naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning, with which you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern soul!",
    "\"Everywhere equality before the law--Nature is not different in that respect, nor better than we\": a fine instance of secret motive, in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and autocratic--likewise a second and more refined atheism--is once more disguised.",
    "\"Ni dieu, ni maitre\"--that, also, is what you want; and therefore \"Cheers for natural law!\"--is it not so?",
    "But, as has been said, that is interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along, who, with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation, could read out of the same \"Nature,\" and with regard to the same phenomena, just the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims of power--an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and unconditionalness of all \"Will to Power\" before your eyes, that almost every word, and the word \"tyranny\" itself, would eventually seem unsuitable, or like a weakening and softening metaphor--as being too human; and who should, nevertheless, end by asserting the same about this world as you do, namely, that it has a \"necessary\" and \"calculable\" course, NOT, however, because laws obtain in it, but because they are absolutely LACKING, and every power effects its ultimate consequences every moment.",
    "Granted that this also is only interpretation--and you will be eager enough to make this objection?--well, so much the better.",

    "All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths.",
    "In so far as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written, evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent, it seems as if nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology and DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it.",
    "The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most intellectual world, the world apparently most indifferent and unprejudiced, and has obviously operated in an injurious, obstructive, blinding, and distorting manner.",
    "A proper physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator, it has \"the heart\" against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the \"good\" and the \"bad\" impulses, causes (as refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong and manly conscience--still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from bad ones.",
    "If, however, a person should regard even the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and imperiousness as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be present, fundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life (which must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further developed), he will suffer from such a view of things as from sea-sickness.",
    "And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous knowledge, and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who CAN do so!",

    "Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who thus \"makes a sacrifice\"--it is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto, on the contrary!--will at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences, for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist.",

    "The martyrdom of the philosopher, his \"sacrifice for the sake of truth,\" forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him; and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity, with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration (deteriorated into a \"martyr,\" into a stage-and-tribune-bawler).",
    "Only, that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any case--merely a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the continued proof that the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.",

    "Let us call this period the PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, \"Know thyself!\" was then still unknown.--In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand, on certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far, that one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin, decide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an important refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in \"origin,\" the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as the MORAL one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is thereby made.",

    "The intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action: under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed, and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the present day.--Is it not possible, however, that the necessity may now have arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing and fundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness and acuteness in man--is it not possible that we may be standing on the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be distinguished negatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when, at least among us immoralists, the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely in that which is NOT INTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness, all that is seen, sensible, or \"sensed\" in it, belongs to its surface or skin--which, like every skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still more?",
    "In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom, which first requires an explanation--a sign, moreover, which has too many interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone: that morality, in the sense in which it has been understood hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a prejudice, perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness, probably something of the same rank as astrology and alchemy, but in any case something which must be surmounted.",
    "The surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even the self-mounting of morality--let that be the name for the long-secret labour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright, and also the most wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones of the soul.",

    "It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice for one's neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, must be mercilessly called to account, and brought to judgment; just as the aesthetics of \"disinterested contemplation,\" under which the emasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience.",
    "There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments \"for others\" and \"NOT for myself,\" for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here, and for one asking promptly: \"Are they not perhaps--DECEPTIONS?\"--That they PLEASE--him who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and also the mere spectator--that is still no argument in their FAVOUR, but just calls for caution.",

    "To have bound up this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect) along with the Old Testament into one book, as the \"Bible,\" as \"The Book in Itself,\" is perhaps the greatest audacity and \"sin against the Spirit\" which literary Europe has upon its conscience.",

    "Formerly, in effect, one believed in \"the soul\" as one believed in grammar and the grammatical subject: one said, \"I\" is the condition, \"think\" is the predicate and is conditioned--to think is an activity for which one MUST suppose a subject as cause.",
    "The attempt was then made, with marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not get out of this net,--to see if the opposite was not perhaps true: \"think\" the condition, and \"I\" the conditioned; \"I,\" therefore, only a synthesis which has been MADE by thinking itself.",
    "KANT really wished to prove that, starting from the subject, the subject could not be proved--nor the object either: the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the subject, and therefore of \"the soul,\" may not always have been strange to him,--the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the Vedanta philosophy.",

    "Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or semi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for its favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its soft placidity called \"prayer,\" the state of perpetual readiness for the \"coming of God\"), I mean the idleness with a good conscience, the idleness of olden times and of blood, to which the aristocratic sentiment that work is DISHONOURING--that it vulgarizes body and soul--is not quite unfamiliar?",
    "And that consequently the modern, noisy, time-engrossing, conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for \"unbelief\" more than anything else?",
    "Among these, for instance, who are at present living apart from religion in Germany, I find \"free-thinkers\" of diversified species and origin, but above all a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know what purpose religions serve, and only note their existence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment.",
    "They feel themselves already fully occupied, these good people, be it by their business or by their pleasures, not to mention the \"Fatherland,\" and the newspapers, and their \"family duties\"; it seems that they have no time whatever left for religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of a new business or a new pleasure--for it is impossible, they say to themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil their tempers.",
    "They are by no means enemies of religious customs; should certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require their participation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many things are done--with a patient and unassuming seriousness, and without much curiosity or discomfort;--they live too much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matters.",
    "Among those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of German Protestants of the middle classes, especially in the great laborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious scholars, and the entire University personnel (with the exception of the theologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve).",
    "On the part of pious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea of HOW MUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his whole profession (and as I have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to which he is compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the \"uncleanliness\" of spirit which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the Church.",
    "It is only with the help of history (NOT through his own personal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference in presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them, he has not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety; perhaps even the contrary.",
    "The practical indifference to religious matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up, usually sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness, which shuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it.--Every age has its own divine type of naivete, for the discovery of which other ages may envy it: and how much naivete--adorable, childlike, and boundlessly foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in his superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the religious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and ABOVE which he himself has developed--he, the little arrogant dwarf and mob-man, the sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of \"ideas,\" of \"modern ideas\"!",

    "Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial.",
    "It is their preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty, lightsome, and false.",
    "Here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration of \"pure forms\" in philosophers as well as in artists: it is not to be doubted that whoever has NEED of the cult of the superficial to that extent, has at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it.",
    "Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt children, the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying to FALSIFY its image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might guess to what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which they wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and deified,--one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists, as their HIGHEST rank.",
    "It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a religious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which divines that truth might be attained TOO soon, before man has become strong enough, hard enough, artist enough....",
    "Piety, the \"Life in God,\" regarded in this light, would appear as the most elaborate and ultimate product of the FEAR of truth, as artist-adoration and artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of all falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at any price.",

    "To love mankind FOR GOD'S SAKE--this has so far been the noblest and remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained.",
    "That love to mankind, without any redeeming intention in the background, is only an ADDITIONAL folly and brutishness, that the inclination to this love has first to get its proportion, its delicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling of ambergris from a higher inclination--whoever first perceived and \"experienced\" this, however his tongue may have stammered as it attempted to express such a delicate matter, let him for all time be holy and respected, as the man who has so far flown highest and gone astray in the finest fashion!",

    "The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand him--as the man of the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the general development of mankind,--will use religion for his disciplining and educating work, just as he will use the contemporary political and economic conditions.",
    "The selecting and disciplining influence--destructive, as well as creative and fashioning--which can be exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to the sort of people placed under its spell and protection.",
    "For those who are strong and independent, destined and trained to command, in whom the judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of authority--as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common, betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter, their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience.",
    "And in the case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative life, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government (over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion itself may be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing GROSSER affairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE filth of all political agitation.",
    "The Brahmins, for instance, understood this fact.",
    "With the help of a religious organization, they secured to themselves the power of nominating kings for the people, while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside, as men with a higher and super-regal mission.",
    "At the same time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which, through fortunate marriage customs, volitional power and delight in self-control are on the increase.",
    "To them religion offers sufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and to experience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and of solitude.",
    "Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy.",
    "And finally, to ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and general utility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart, ennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy, with something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of justification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all the semi-animal poverty of their souls.",
    "Religion, together with the religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually harassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it operates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner, almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it.",
    "There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity and Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough to live--this very difficulty being necessary.",
    "62.",
    "To be sure--to make also the bad counter-reckoning against such religions, and to bring to light their secret dangers--the cost is always excessive and terrible when religions do NOT operate as an educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher, but rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they wish to be the final end, and not a means along with other means.",
    "Among men, as among all other animals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating, infirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful cases, among men also, are always the exception; and in view of the fact that man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare exception.",
    "But worse still.",
    "The higher the type a man represents, the greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the accidental, the law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind, manifests itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of men, the conditions of whose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult to determine.",
    "What, then, is the attitude of the two greatest religions above-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life?",
    "They endeavour to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the religions FOR SUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle; they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease, and they would fain treat every other experience of life as false and impossible.",
    "However highly we may esteem this indulgent and preservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied, and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of man), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religions--to give a general appreciation of them--are among the principal causes which have kept the type of \"man\" upon a lower level--they have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE PERISHED.",
    "One has to thank them for invaluable services; and who is sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that the \"spiritual men\" of Christianity have done for Europe hitherto!",
    "But when they had given comfort to the sufferers, courage to the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to the helpless, and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual penitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had they to do in order to work systematically in that fashion, and with a good conscience, for the preservation of all the sick and suffering, which means, in deed and in truth, to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE EUROPEAN RACE?",
    "To REVERSE all estimates of value--THAT is what they had to do!",
    "And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast suspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything autonomous, manly, conquering, and imperious--all instincts which are natural to the highest and most successful type of \"man\"--into uncertainty, distress of conscience, and self-destruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy over the earth, into hatred of the earth and earthly things--THAT is the task the Church imposed on itself, and was obliged to impose, until, according to its standard of value, \"unworldliness,\" \"unsensuousness,\" and \"higher man\" fused into one sentiment.",
    "If one could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse and refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and impartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would never cease marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some single will has ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a SUBLIME ABORTION of man?",
    "He, however, who, with opposite requirements (no longer Epicurean) and with some divine hammer in his hand, could approach this almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in the European Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not have to cry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: \"Oh, you bunglers, presumptuous pitiful bunglers, what have you done!",
    "Was that a work for your hands?",
    "How you have hacked and botched my finest stone!",
    "What have you presumed to do!\"--I should say that Christianity has hitherto been the most portentous of presumptions.",
    "Men, not great enough, nor hard enough, to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men, not sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime self-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and perishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from man:--SUCH men, with their \"equality before God,\" have hitherto swayed the destiny of Europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species has been produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly, mediocre, the European of the present day.",

    "The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtle, belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the \"Science of Morals\" belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered:--an interesting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a moralist.",
    "Indeed, the expression, \"Science of Morals\" is, in respect to what is designated thereby, far too presumptuous and counter to GOOD taste,--which is always a foretaste of more modest expressions.",
    "One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT is still necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for the present: namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth, and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish--and perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common forms of these living crystallizations--as preparation for a THEORY OF TYPES of morality.",
    "To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest.",
    "All the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness, demanded of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science: they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality--and every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself, however, has been regarded as something \"given.\"",
    "How far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problem--left in dust and decay--of a description of forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough for it!",
    "It was precisely owing to moral philosophers' knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary epitome, or an accidental abridgement--perhaps as the morality of their environment, their position, their church, their Zeitgeist, their climate and zone--it was precisely because they were badly instructed with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means eager to know about these matters, that they did not even come in sight of the real problems of morals--problems which only disclose themselves by a comparison of MANY kinds of morality.",
    "In every \"Science of Morals\" hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything problematic there!",
    "That which philosophers called \"giving a basis to morality,\" and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light, proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new means of its EXPRESSION, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in question--and in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and vivisecting of this very faith.",
    "Hear, for instance, with what innocence--almost worthy of honour--Schopenhauer represents his own task, and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a \"Science\" whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and old wives: \"The principle,\" he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der Ethik), [Footnote: Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer's Basis of Morality, translated by Arthur B. Bullock, M.A. (1903).]",
    "\"the axiom about the purport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede, immo omnes quantum potes juva--is REALLY the proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish, ... the REAL basis of ethics which has been sought, like the philosopher's stone, for centuries.",
    "\"--The difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be great--it is well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his efforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is Will to Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a pessimist, ACTUALLY--played the flute...",
    "daily after dinner: one may read about the matter in his biography.",
    "A question by the way: a pessimist, a repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES A HALT at morality--who assents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what?",
    "Is that really--a pessimist?",
    "187.",
    "Apart from the value of such assertions as \"there is a categorical imperative in us,\" one can always ask: What does such an assertion indicate about him who makes it?",
    "There are systems of morals which are meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems of morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied; with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others he wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction,--this system of morals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something of him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant especially, gives us to understand by his morals that \"what is estimable in me, is that I know how to obey--and with you it SHALL not be otherwise than with me!\"",
    "In short, systems of morals are only a SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.",
    "188.",
    "In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of tyranny against \"nature\" and also against \"reason\", that is, however, no objection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is essential and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a long constraint.",
    "In order to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal, or Puritanism, one should remember the constraint under which every language has attained to strength and freedom--the metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm.",
    "How much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation given themselves!--not excepting some of the prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness--\"for the sake of a folly,\" as utilitarian bunglers say, and thereby deem themselves wise--\"from submission to arbitrary laws,\" as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves \"free,\" even free-spirited.",
    "The singular fact remains, however, that everything of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and masterly certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought itself, or in administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just as in conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary law, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely this is \"nature\" and \"natural\"--and not laisser-aller!",
    "Every artist knows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his \"most natural\" condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing, and constructing in the moments of \"inspiration\"--and how strictly and delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness and precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold, and ambiguous in it).",
    "The essential thing \"in heaven and in earth\" is, apparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE in the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in the long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance, virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality--anything whatever that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine.",
    "The long bondage of the spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of ideas, the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable to Aristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:--all this violence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness, has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has attained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility; granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled, suffocated, and spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere, \"nature\" shows herself as she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT magnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless noble).",
    "That for centuries European thinkers only thought in order to prove something--nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every thinker who \"wishes to prove something\"--that it was always settled beforehand what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking, as it was perhaps in the Asiatic astrology of former times, or as it is still at the present day in the innocent, Christian-moral explanation of immediate personal events \"for the glory of God,\" or \"for the good of the soul\":--this tyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent stupidity, has EDUCATED the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and the finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual education and discipline.",
    "One may look at every system of morals in this light: it is \"nature\" therein which teaches to hate the laisser-aller, the too great freedom, and implants the need for limited horizons, for immediate duties--it teaches the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in a certain sense, that stupidity is a condition of life and development.",
    "\"Thou must obey some one, and for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come to grief, and lose all respect for thyself\"--this seems to me to be the moral imperative of nature, which is certainly neither \"categorical,\" as old Kant wished (consequently the \"otherwise\"), nor does it address itself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual!), but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all, however, to the animal \"man\" generally, to MANKIND.",
    "189.",
    "Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such an extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his week--and work-day again:--as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated FAST, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although, as is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect to work).",
    "Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful influences and habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary days are appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to hunger anew.",
    "Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism, seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during which an impulse learns to humble and submit itself--at the same time also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise admit of a similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst of Hellenic culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with Aphrodisiacal odours).--Here also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox, why it was precisely in the most Christian period of European history, and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiments, that the sexual impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion).",
    "190.",
    "There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might say, in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was too noble.",
    "\"No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done unwittingly.",
    "The evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do so, however, if he knew that evil is evil.",
    "The evil man, therefore, is only evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarily make him--good.",
    "\"--This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically judge that \"it is STUPID to do wrong\"; while they accept \"good\" as identical with \"useful and pleasant,\" without further thought.",
    "As regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.--Plato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret himself into them--he, the most daring of all interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out of the street, as a popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless and impossible modifications--namely, in all his own disguises and multiplicities.",
    "In jest, and in Homeric language as well, what is the Platonic Socrates, if not--[Greek words inserted here.] 191.",
    "The old theological problem of \"Faith\" and \"Knowledge,\" or more plainly, of instinct and reason--the question whether, in respect to the valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than rationality, which wants to appreciate and act according to motives, according to a \"Why,\" that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utility--it is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of Socrates, and had divided men's minds long before Christianity.",
    "Socrates himself, following, of course, the taste of his talent--that of a surpassing dialectician--took first the side of reason; and, in fact, what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions?",
    "In the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also at himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found in himself the same difficulty and incapacity.",
    "\"But why\"--he said to himself--\"should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts!",
    "One must set them right, and the reason ALSO--one must follow the instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments.\"",
    "This was the real FALSENESS of that great and mysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that he was satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived the irrationality in the moral judgment.--Plato, more innocent in such matters, and without the craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to himself, at the expenditure of all his strength--the greatest strength a philosopher had ever expended--that reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal, to the good, to \"God\"; and since Plato, all theologians and philosophers have followed the same path--which means that in matters of morality, instinct (or as Christians call it, \"Faith,\" or as I call it, \"the herd\") has hitherto triumphed.",
    "Unless one should make an exception in the case of Descartes, the father of rationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution), who recognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool, and Descartes was superficial.",
    "192.",
    "Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest processes of all \"knowledge and cognizance\": there, as here, the premature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to \"belief,\" and the lack of distrust and patience are first developed--our senses learn late, and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and cautious organs of knowledge.",
    "Our eyes find it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more force, more \"morality.\"",
    "It is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything new; we hear strange music badly.",
    "When we hear another language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into words with which we are more familiar and conversant--it was thus, for example, that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into ARMBRUST (cross-bow).",
    "Our senses are also hostile and averse to the new; and generally, even in the \"simplest\" processes of sensation, the emotions DOMINATE--such as fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion of indolence.--As little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words (not to speak of syllables) of a page--he rather takes about five out of every twenty words at random, and \"guesses\" the probably appropriate sense to them--just as little do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to its leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so much easier to fancy the chance of a tree.",
    "Even in the midst of the most remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the greater part of the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate any event, EXCEPT as \"inventors\" thereof.",
    "All this goes to prove that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have been--ACCUSTOMED TO LYING.",
    "Or, to express it more politely and hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly--one is much more of an artist than one is aware of.--In an animated conversation, I often see the face of the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply defined before me, according to the thought he expresses, or which I believe to be evoked in his mind, that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the STRENGTH of my visual faculty--the delicacy of the play of the muscles and of the expression of the eyes MUST therefore be imagined by me.",

    "Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise.",
    "What we experience in dreams, provided we experience it often, pertains at last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything \"actually\" experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer, we have a requirement more or less, and finally, in broad daylight, and even in the brightest moments of our waking life, we are ruled to some extent by the nature of our dreams.",
    "Supposing that someone has often flown in his dreams, and that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable happiness; such a person, who believes that on the slightest impulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who knows the sensation of a certain divine levity, an \"upwards\" without effort or constraint, a \"downwards\" without descending or lowering--without TROUBLE!--how could the man with such dream-experiences and dream-habits fail to find \"happiness\" differently coloured and defined, even in his waking hours!",
    "How could he fail--to long DIFFERENTLY for happiness?",
    "\"Flight,\" such as is described by poets, must, when compared with his own \"flying,\" be far too earthly, muscular, violent, far too \"troublesome\" for him.",
    "194.",
    "The difference among men does not manifest itself only in the difference of their lists of desirable things--in their regarding different good things as worth striving for, and being disagreed as to the greater or less value, the order of rank, of the commonly recognized desirable things:--it manifests itself much more in what they regard as actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing.",
    "As regards a woman, for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for possession, sees the \"questionableness,\" the mere apparentness of such ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for his sake what she has or would like to have--only THEN does he look upon her as \"possessed.\"",
    "A third, however, has not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether the woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do so for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed, profoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found out.",
    "Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality.",
    "One man would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts of Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose.",
    "Another, with a more refined thirst for possession, says to himself: \"One may not deceive where one desires to possess\"--he is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: \"I must, therefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!\"",
    "Among helpful and charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as though, for instance, he should \"merit\" help, seek just THEIR help, and would show himself deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them for all help.",
    "With these conceits, they take control of the needy as a property, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property.",
    "One finds them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity.",
    "Parents involuntarily make something like themselves out of their children--they call that \"education\"; no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is thereby her property, no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN ideas and notions of worth.",
    "Indeed, in former times fathers deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly born (as among the ancient Germans).",

    "Their prophets fused into one the expressions \"rich,\" \"godless,\" \"wicked,\" \"violent,\" \"sensual,\" and for the first time coined the word \"world\" as a term of reproach.",
    "In this inversion of valuations (in which is also included the use of the word \"poor\" as synonymous with \"saint\" and \"friend\") the significance of the Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM that the SLAVE-INSURRECTION IN MORALS commences.",

    "Does it not seem that there is a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists?",

    "All the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to their \"happiness,\" as it is called--what else are they but suggestions for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in which the individuals live; recipes for their passions, their good and bad propensities, insofar as such have the Will to Power and would like to play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborations, permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wife wisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in their form--because they address themselves to \"all,\" because they generalize where generalization is not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally, and taking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merely with one grain of salt, but rather endurable only, and sometimes even seductive, when they are over-spiced and begin to smell dangerously, especially of \"the other world.\"",
    "That is all of little value when estimated intellectually, and is far from being \"science,\" much less \"wisdom\"; but, repeated once more, and three times repeated, it is expediency, expediency, expediency, mixed with stupidity, stupidity, stupidity--whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness towards the heated folly of the emotions, which the Stoics advised and fostered; or the no-more-laughing and no-more-weeping of Spinoza, the destruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection, which he recommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent mean at which they may be satisfied, the Aristotelianism of morals; or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art, perhaps as music, or as love of God, and of mankind for God's sake--for in religion the passions are once more enfranchised, provided that...; or, finally, even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions, as has been taught by Hafis and Goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of wise old codgers and drunkards, with whom it \"no longer has much danger.\"--This also for the chapter: \"Morals as Timidity.\"",

    "Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed, there have also been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples, states, churches), and always a great number who obey in proportion to the small number who command--in view, therefore, of the fact that obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto, one may reasonably suppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is now innate in every one, as a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which gives the command \"Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally refrain from something\", in short, \"Thou shalt\".",
    "This need tries to satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content, according to its strength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous appetite with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into its ear by all sorts of commanders--parents, teachers, laws, class prejudices, or public opinion.",
    "The extraordinary limitation of human development, the hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and turning thereof, is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of obedience is transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command.",
    "If one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just as if they also were only obeying.",
    "This condition of things actually exists in Europe at present--I call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class.",
    "They know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of the law, or of God himself), or they even justify themselves by maxims from the current opinions of the herd, as \"first servants of their people,\" or \"instruments of the public weal\".",
    "On the other hand, the gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only kind of man that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as public spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty, indulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and useful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues.",
    "In cases, however, where it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative constitutions, for example, are of this origin.",
    "In spite of all, what a blessing, what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable, is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeans--of this fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon was the last great proof the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its worthiest individuals and periods.",

    "The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with one another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his body--that is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts and standards of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom at peace--such a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an average, be a weak man.",
    "His fundamental desire is that the war which is IN HIM should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine and mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean or Christian); it is above all things the happiness of repose, of undisturbedness, of repletion, of final unity--it is the \"Sabbath of Sabbaths,\" to use the expression of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine, who was himself such a man.--Should, however, the contrariety and conflict in such natures operate as an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus to life--and if, on the other hand, in addition to their powerful and irreconcilable instincts, they have also inherited and indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict with themselves (that is to say, the faculty of self-control and self-deception), there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and inexplicable beings, those enigmatical men, predestined for conquering and circumventing others, the finest examples of which are Alcibiades and Caesar (with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans according to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick the Second), and among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci.",

    "As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be no \"morality of love to one's neighbour.\"",
    "Granted even that there is already a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness, gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly distinguished by honourable names as \"virtues,\" and eventually almost coincide with the conception \"morality\": in that period they do not as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations--they are still ULTRA-MORAL.",
    "A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good nor bad, moral nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should it be praised, a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this praise, even at the best, directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES PUBLICA.",
    "After all, \"love to our neighbour\" is always a secondary matter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR.",
    "After the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against external dangers, it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral valuation.",
    "Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such as the love of enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and love of power, which up till then had not only to be honoured from the point of view of general utility--under other names, of course, than those here given--but had to be fostered and cultivated (because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong--when the outlets for them are lacking--and are gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny.",
    "The contrary instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its conclusions.",
    "How much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a disposition, or an endowment--that is now the moral perspective, here again fear is the mother of morals.",
    "It is by the loftiest and strongest instincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above and beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed.",
    "The lofty independent spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and honour.",
    "Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is always less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, \"the lamb,\" and still more \"the sheep,\" wins respect.",
    "There is a point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society itself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL, and does so, in fact, seriously and honestly.",

    "Punishment itself is terrible!\"--with these questions gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate conclusion.",

    "What avail is it?",
    "We cannot do otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is.",
    "We have found that in all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become unanimous, including likewise the countries where European influence prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to teach--they \"know\" today what is good and evil.",
    "It must then sound hard and be distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which here thinks it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame, and calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human animal, the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more to the front, to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts, according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the symptom.",

    "AT PRESENT IS HERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and therefore, as we understand the matter, only one kind of human morality, beside which, before which, and after which many other moralities, and above all HIGHER moralities, are or should be possible.",
    "Against such a \"possibility,\" against such a \"should be,\" however, this morality defends itself with all its strength, it says obstinately and inexorably \"I am morality itself and nothing else is morality!\"",
    "Indeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things have reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of this morality even in political and social arrangements: the DEMOCRATIC movement is the inheritance of the Christian movement.",
    "That its TEMPO, however, is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones, for those who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated by the increasingly furious howling, and always less disguised teeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now roving through the highways of European culture.",
    "Apparently in opposition to the peacefully industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and still more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who call themselves Socialists and want a \"free society,\" those are really at one with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even of repudiating the notions \"master\" and \"servant\"--ni dieu ni maitre, says a socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every special claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs \"rights\" any longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it were a violation of the weak, unfair to the NECESSARY consequences of all former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy, in their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the very animals, up even to \"God\"--the extravagance of \"sympathy for God\" belongs to a democratic age);",

    "To teach man the future of humanity as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in rearing and educating, in order thereby to put an end to the frightful rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of \"history\" (the folly of the \"greatest number\" is only its last form)--for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will some time or other be needed, at the very idea of which everything that has existed in the way of occult, terrible, and benevolent beings might look pale and dwarfed.",

    "I mean to say that one must have the right out of one's own EXPERIENCE--experience, as it seems to me, always implies unfortunate experience?--to treat of such an important question of rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST science like women and artists (\"Ah! this dreadful science!\"",
    "sigh their instinct and their shame, \"it always FINDS THINGS OUT!\").",
    "The declaration of independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy, is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and disorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best springtime--which does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise smells sweet.",
    "Here also the instinct of the populace cries, \"Freedom from all masters!\"",
    "and after science has, with the happiest results, resisted theology, whose \"hand-maid\" it had been too long, it now proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for philosophy, and in its turn to play the \"master\"--what am I saying!",
    "to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account.",
    "My memory--the memory of a scientific man, if you please!--teems with the naivetes of insolence which I have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young naturalists and old physicians (not to mention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men, the philologists and schoolmasters, who are both the one and the other by profession).",
    "On one occasion it was the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby.",
    "On another occasion it was the colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but a series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure which \"does nobody any good\".",
    "At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another time the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily extended to disregard of philosophy generally.",
    "In fine, I found most frequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars, the evil after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the whole obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of--the result being a general ill-will to all philosophy.",
    "(Such seems to me, for instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern Germany: by his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection with German culture, which culture, all things considered, has been an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive, and un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.)",
    "On the whole, speaking generally, it may just have been the humanness, all-too-humanness of the modern philosophers themselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the populace.",
    "Let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the world of Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and whatever else all the royal and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called, and with what justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and origin, in view of such representatives of philosophy, who, owing to the fashion of the present day, are just as much aloft as they are down below--in Germany, for instance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist Eugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann.",
    "It is especially the sight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves \"realists,\" or \"positivists,\" which is calculated to implant a dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those philosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and specialists, that is very evident!",

    "Science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible on its countenance, while that to which the entire modern philosophy has gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the present day, excites distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to a \"theory of knowledge,\" no more in fact than a diffident science of epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even gets beyond the threshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right to enter--that is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony, something that awakens pity.",
    "How could such a philosophy--RULE!",
    "205.",
    "The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to maturity.",
    "The extent and towering structure of the sciences have increased enormously, and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach himself somewhere and \"specialize\" so that he will no longer attain to his elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection, and his DESPECTION.",
    "Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his maturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no longer of much importance.",
    "It is perhaps just the refinement of his intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the way, he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a milleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost his self-respect no longer commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should aspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and spiritual rat-catcher--in short, a misleader.",
    "This is in the last instance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of conscience.",
    "To double once more the philosopher's difficulties, there is also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not concerning science, but concerning life and the worth of life--he learns unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying) experiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded.",
    "In fact, the philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either with the scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously elevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and God-intoxicated man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised, because he lives \"wisely,\" or \"as a philosopher,\" it hardly means anything more than \"prudently and apart.\"",
    "Wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kind of flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a bad game; but the GENUINE philosopher--does it not seem so to US, my friends?--lives \"unphilosophically\" and \"unwisely,\" above all, IMPRUDENTLY, and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts and temptations of life--he risks HIMSELF constantly, he plays THIS bad game.",
    "206.",
    "In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either ENGENDERS or PRODUCES--both words understood in their fullest sense--the man of learning, the scientific average man, has always something of the old maid about him; for, like her, he is not conversant with the two principal functions of man.",
    "To both, of course, to the scholar and to the old maid, one concedes respectability, as if by way of indemnification--in these cases one emphasizes the respectability--and yet, in the compulsion of this concession, one has the same admixture of vexation.",
    "Let us examine more closely: what is the scientific man?",
    "Firstly, a commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is to say, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type of man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file, equability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the instinct for people like himself, and for that which they require--for instance: the portion of independence and green meadow without which there is no rest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration (which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability), the sunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness, with which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and again to be overcome.",
    "The learned man, as is appropriate, has also maladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and has a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations he cannot attain.",
    "He is confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go, but does not FLOW; and precisely before the man of the great current he stands all the colder and more reserved--his eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake, which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy.",
    "The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results from the instinct of mediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of mediocrity, which labours instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man, and endeavours to break--or still better, to relax--every bent bow To relax, of course, with consideration, and naturally with an indulgent hand--to RELAX with confiding sympathy that is the real art of Jesuitism, which has always understood how to introduce itself as the religion of sympathy.",
    "207.",
    "However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit--and who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded IPSISIMOSITY!--in the end, however, one must learn caution even with regard to one's gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been celebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation and glorification--as is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the highest honours to \"disinterested knowledge\" The objective man, who no longer curses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand complete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly instruments that exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful",
    "He is only an instrument, we may say, he is a MIRROR--he is no \"purpose in himself\" The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration before everything that wants to be known, with such desires only as knowing or \"reflecting\" implies--he waits until something comes, and then expands himself sensitively, so that even the light footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface and film Whatever \"personality\" he still possesses seems to him accidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms and events He calls up the recollection of \"himself\" with an effort, and not infrequently wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other persons, he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only is he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health, or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack of companions and society--indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his suffering, but in vain!",
    "His thoughts already rove away to the MORE GENERAL case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how to help himself He does not now take himself seriously and devote time to himself he is serene, NOT from lack of trouble, but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences, the radiant and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that comes his way, his habit of inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous indifference as to Yea and Nay: alas!",

    "\"JE NE MEPRISE PRESQUE RIEN\"--he says, with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue the PRESQUE!",
    "Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of any one, nor after, either; he places himself generally too far off to have any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil.",
    "If he has been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER, with the Caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization, he has had far too much honour, and what is more essential in him has been overlooked--he is an instrument, something of a slave, though certainly the sublimest sort of slave, but nothing in himself--PRESQUE RIEN!",
    "The objective man is an instrument, a costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring instrument and mirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and respected; but he is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary man in whom the REST of existence justifies itself, no termination--and still less a commencement, an engendering, or primary cause, nothing hardy, powerful, self-centred, that wants to be master; but rather only a soft, inflated, delicate, movable potter's-form, that must wait for some kind of content and frame to \"shape\" itself thereto--for the most part a man without frame and content, a \"selfless\" man.",
    "Consequently, also, nothing for women, IN PARENTHESI.",
    "208.",
    "When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic--I hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the objective spirit?--people all hear it impatiently; they regard him on that account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many, many questions... indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so many, he is henceforth said to be dangerous.",
    "With his repudiation of skepticism, it seems to them as if they heard some evil-threatening sound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried somewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian NIHILINE, a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS, that not only denies, means denial, but--dreadful thought!",
    "PRACTISES denial.",
    "Against this kind of \"good-will\"--a will to the veritable, actual negation of life--there is, as is generally acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative than skepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism; and Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an antidote to the \"spirit,\" and its underground noises.",
    "\"Are not our ears already full of bad sounds?\" say the skeptics, as lovers of repose, and almost as a kind of safety police; \"this subterranean Nay is terrible!",
    "Be still, ye pessimistic moles!\"",
    "The skeptic, in effect, that delicate creature, is far too easily frightened; his conscience is schooled so as to start at every Nay, and even at that sharp, decided Yea, and feels something like a bite thereby.",
    "Yea!",
    "and Nay!--they seem to him opposed to morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a festival to his virtue by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with Montaigne: \"What do I know?\"",
    "Or with Socrates: \"I know that I know nothing.\"",
    "Or: \"Here I do not trust myself, no door is open to me.\"",
    "Or: \"Even if the door were open, why should I enter immediately?\"",

    "The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx, too, is a Circe, and Circe, too, was a philosopher.",
    "\"--Thus does a skeptic console himself; and in truth he needs some consolation.",
    "For skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiological temperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and sickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been long separated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another.",
    "In the new generation, which has inherited as it were different standards and valuations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and tentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues prevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium, ballast, and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul.",
    "That, however, which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the WILL; they are no longer familiar with independence of decision, or the courageous feeling of pleasure in willing--they are doubtful of the \"freedom of the will\" even in their dreams Our present-day Europe, the scene of a senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes, and CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its heights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with gloomy aspect, like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signs--and often sick unto death of its will!",
    "Paralysis of will, where do we not find this cripple sitting nowadays!",
    "And yet how bedecked oftentimes' How seductively ornamented!",
    "There are the finest gala dresses and disguises for this disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself nowadays in the show-cases as \"objectiveness,\" \"the scientific spirit,\" \"L'ART POUR L'ART,\" and \"pure voluntary knowledge,\" is only decked-out skepticism and paralysis of will--I am ready to answer for this diagnosis of the European disease--The disease of the will is diffused unequally over Europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization has longest prevailed, it decreases according as \"the barbarian\" still--or again--asserts his claims under the loose drapery of Western culture",
    "It is therefore in the France of today, as can be readily disclosed and comprehended, that the will is most infirm, and France, which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive, now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over Europe, by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism The power to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is already somewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the North of Germany it is stronger than in Central Germany, it is considerably stronger in England, Spain, and Corsica, associated with phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the latter--not to mention Italy, which is too young yet to know what it wants, and must first show whether it can exercise will, but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle empire where Europe as it were flows back to Asia--namely, in Russia There the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated, there the will--uncertain whether to be negative or affirmative--waits threateningly to be discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from our physicists)",
    "Perhaps not only Indian wars and complications in Asia would be necessary to free Europe from its greatest danger, but also internal subversion, the shattering of the empire into small states, and above all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility, together with the obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do not say this as one who desires it, in my heart I should rather prefer the contrary--I mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threatening--namely, TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-out comedy of its petty-statism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close.",
    "The time for petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the dominion of the world--the COMPULSION to great politics.",
    "209.",
    "As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger kind of skepticism, I should like to express myself preliminarily merely by a parable, which the lovers of German history will already understand.",
    "That unscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers (who, as King of Prussia, brought into being a military and skeptical genius--and therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged type of German), the problematic, crazy father of Frederick the Great, had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew what was then lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred times more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form--his ill-will to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound instinct.",
    "MEN WERE LACKING; and he suspected, to his bitterest regret, that his own son was not man enough.",
    "There, however, he deceived himself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place?",
    "He saw his son lapsed to atheism, to the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of clever Frenchmen--he saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the spider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard enough either for evil or good, and of a broken will that no longer commands, is no longer ABLE to command.",
    "Meanwhile, however, there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous skepticism--who knows TO WHAT EXTENT it was encouraged just by his father's hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to solitude?--the skepticism of daring manliness, which is closely related to the genius for war and conquest, and made its first entrance into Germany in the person of the great Frederick.",
    "This skepticism despises and nevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it does not believe, but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit a dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the heart.",
    "It is the GERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued Fredericianism, risen to the highest spirituality, has kept Europe for a considerable time under the dominion of the German spirit and its critical and historical distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character of the great German philologists and historical critics (who, rightly estimated, were also all of them artists of destruction and dissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually established itself--in spite of all Romanticism in music and philosophy--in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was decidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, as courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute will to dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized North Pole expeditions under barren and dangerous skies.",
    "There may be good grounds for it when warm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this spirit, CET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet calls it, not without a shudder.",
    "But if one would realize how characteristic is this fear of the \"man\" in the German spirit which awakened Europe out of its \"dogmatic slumber,\" let us call to mind the former conception which had to be overcome by this new one--and that it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with unbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of Europe as gentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools.",
    "Finally, let us only understand profoundly enough Napoleon's astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for centuries as the \"German spirit\" \"VOILA UN HOMME!\"--that was as much as to say \"But this is a MAN!",
    "And I only expected to see a German!\" 210.",
    "Supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the future, some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps be skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in them would only be designated thereby--and not they themselves.",
    "With equal right they might call themselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of experiments.",
    "By the name with which I ventured to baptize them, I have already expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is this because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use of experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense?",
    "In their passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in daring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic century can approve of?--There is no doubt these coming ones will be least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as to standards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method, the wary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for self-responsibility, indeed, they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT in denial and dissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows how to handle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds They will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves only) than humane people may desire, they will not deal with the \"truth\" in order that it may \"please\" them, or \"elevate\" and \"inspire\" them--they will rather have little faith in \"TRUTH\" bringing with it such revels for the feelings.",
    "They will smile, those rigorous spirits, when any one says in their presence \"That thought elevates me, why should it not be true?\"",
    "or \"That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?\"",
    "or \"That artist enlarges me, why should he not be great?\"",
    "Perhaps they will not only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus rapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one could look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily find therein the intention to reconcile \"Christian sentiments\" with \"antique taste,\" or even with \"modern parliamentarism\" (the kind of reconciliation necessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory century).",
    "Critical discipline, and every habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters, will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of the future, they may even make a display thereof as their special adornment--nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that account.",
    "It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to have it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that \"philosophy itself is criticism and critical science--and nothing else whatever!\"",
    "Though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of France and Germany (and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste of KANT: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works), our new philosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are instruments of the philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments, they are far from being philosophers themselves!",
    "Even the great Chinaman of Konigsberg was only a great critic.",
    "211.",
    "I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding philosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with philosophers--that precisely here one should strictly give \"each his own,\" and not give those far too much, these far too little.",
    "It may be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants, the scientific workers of philosophy, remain standing, and MUST remain standing he himself must perhaps have been critic, and dogmatist, and historian, and besides, poet, and collector, and traveler, and riddle-reader, and moralist, and seer, and \"free spirit,\" and almost everything, in order to traverse the whole range of human values and estimations, and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eyes and consciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth up to any height, from a nook into any expanse.",
    "But all these are only preliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands something else--it requires him TO CREATE VALUES.",
    "The philosophical workers, after the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel, have to fix and formalize some great existing body of valuations--that is to say, former DETERMINATIONS OF VALUE, creations of value, which have become prevalent, and are for a time called \"truths\"--whether in the domain of the LOGICAL, the POLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC.",
    "It is for these investigators to make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto, conspicuous, conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to shorten everything long, even \"time\" itself, and to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an immense and wonderful task, in the carrying out of which all refined pride, all tenacious will, can surely find satisfaction.",
    "THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS, HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS; they say: \"Thus SHALL it be!\"",
    "They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind, and thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and all subjugators of the past--they grasp at the future with a creative hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an instrument, and a hammer.",
    "Their \"knowing\" is CREATING, their creating is a law-giving, their will to truth is--WILL TO POWER.--Are there at present such philosophers?",
    "Have there ever been such philosophers?",
    "MUST there not be such philosophers some day? ...",
    "212.",
    "It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever found himself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in contradiction to the day in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his day.",
    "Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one calls philosophers--who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom, but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators--have found their mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end, however, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of their age.",
    "In putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been for the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a new untrodden path to his aggrandizement.",
    "They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy, indolence, self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how much virtue was OUTLIVED, they have always said \"We must remove hence to where YOU are least at home\" In the face of a world of \"modern ideas,\" which would like to confine every one in a corner, in a \"specialty,\" a philosopher, if there could be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled to place the greatness of man, the conception of \"greatness,\" precisely in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness, in his all-roundness, he would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which a man could bear and take upon himself, according to the EXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will, nothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently, in the ideal of the philosopher, strength of will, sternness, and capacity for prolonged resolution, must specially be included in the conception of \"greatness\", with as good a right as the opposite doctrine, with its ideal of a silly, renouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to an opposite age--such as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its accumulated energy of will, and from the wildest torrents and floods of selfishness In the time of Socrates, among men only of worn-out instincts, old conservative Athenians who let themselves go--\"for the sake of happiness,\" as they said, for the sake of pleasure, as their conduct indicated--and who had continually on their lips the old pompous words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led, IRONY was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul, the wicked Socratic assurance of the old physician and plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh, as into the flesh and heart of the \"noble,\" with a look that said plainly enough \"Do not dissemble before me!",
    "here--we are equal!\"",
    "At present, on the contrary, when throughout Europe the herding-animal alone attains to honours, and dispenses honours, when \"equality of right\" can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong--I mean to say into general war against everything rare, strange, and privileged, against the higher man, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher responsibility, the creative plenipotence and lordliness--at present it belongs to the conception of \"greatness\" to be noble, to wish to be apart, to be capable of being different, to stand alone, to have to live by personal initiative, and the philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts \"He shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good and evil, the master of his virtues, and of super-abundance of will; precisely this shall be called GREATNESS: as diversified as can be entire, as ample as can be full.\"",
    "And to ask once more the question: Is greatness POSSIBLE--nowadays?",
    "213.",
    "It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot be taught: one must \"know\" it by experience--or one should have the pride NOT to know it.",
    "The fact that at present people all talk of things of which they CANNOT have any experience, is true more especially and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical matters:--the very few know them, are permitted to know them, and all popular ideas about them are false.",
    "Thus, for instance, the truly philosophical combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace, and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step, is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience, and therefore, should any one speak of it in their presence, it is incredible to them.",
    "They conceive of every necessity as troublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint; thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating, almost as a trouble, and often enough as \"worthy of the SWEAT of the noble\"--but not at all as something easy and divine, closely related to dancing and exuberance!",
    "\"To think\" and to take a matter \"seriously,\" \"arduously\"--that is one and the same thing to them; such only has been their \"experience.",
    "\"--Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything \"arbitrarily,\" and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax--in short, that necessity and \"freedom of will\" are then the same thing with them.",
    "There is, in fine, a gradation of rank in psychical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality.",
    "Of what use is it for nimble, everyday intellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists to press, in their plebeian ambition, close to such problems, and as it were into this \"holy of holies\"--as so often happens nowadays!",
    "But coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is provided for in the primary law of things; the doors remain closed to those intruders, though they may dash and break their heads thereon.",
    "People have always to be born to a high station, or, more definitely, they have to be BRED for it: a person has only a right to philosophy--taking the word in its higher significance--in virtue of his descent; the ancestors, the \"blood,\" decide here also.",
    "Many generations must have prepared the way for the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have been separately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the bold, easy, delicate course and current of his thoughts, but above all the readiness for great responsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance and contemning look, the feeling of separation from the multitude with their duties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever is misunderstood and calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight and practice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of will, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely loves....",
    "CHAPTER VII.",
    "OUR VIRTUES 214.",
    "OUR Virtues?--It is probable that we, too, have still our virtues, although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a little distance from us.",
    "We Europeans of the day after tomorrow, we firstlings of the twentieth century--with all our dangerous curiosity, our multifariousness and art of disguising, our mellow and seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense and spirit--we shall presumably, IF we must have virtues, have those only which have come to agreement with our most secret and heartfelt inclinations, with our most ardent requirements: well, then, let us look for them in our labyrinths!--where, as we know, so many things lose themselves, so many things get quite lost!",
    "And is there anything finer than to SEARCH for one's own virtues?",
    "Is it not almost to BELIEVE in one's own virtues?",
    "But this \"believing in one's own virtues\"--is it not practically the same as what was formerly called one's \"good conscience,\" that long, respectable pigtail of an idea, which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often enough also behind their understandings?",
    "It seems, therefore, that however little we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly respectable in other respects, in one thing we are nevertheless the worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last Europeans with good consciences: we also still wear their pigtail.--Ah!",
    "if you only knew how soon, so very soon--it will be different!",
    "215.",
    "As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different colours shine around a single planet, now with red light, now with green, and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley colours: so we modern men, owing to the complicated mechanism of our \"firmament,\" are determined by DIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine alternately in different colours, and are seldom unequivocal--and there are often cases, also, in which our actions are MOTLEY-COLOURED.",
    "216.",
    "To love one's enemies?",
    "I think that has been well learnt: it takes place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeed, at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place:--we learn to DESPISE when we love, and precisely when we love best; all of it, however, unconsciously, without noise, without ostentation, with the shame and secrecy of goodness, which forbids the utterance of the pompous word and the formula of virtue.",
    "Morality as attitude--is opposed to our taste nowadays.",
    "This is ALSO an advance, as it was an advance in our fathers that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste, including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion (and all that formerly belonged to freethinker-pantomime).",
    "It is the music in our conscience, the dance in our spirit, to which Puritan litanies, moral sermons, and goody-goodness won't chime.",
    "217.",
    "Let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment!",
    "They never forgive us if they have once made a mistake BEFORE us (or even with REGARD to us)--they inevitably become our instinctive calumniators and detractors, even when they still remain our \"friends.",
    "\"--Blessed are the forgetful: for they \"get the better\" even of their blunders.",

    "The psychologists of France--and where else are there still psychologists nowadays?--have never yet exhausted their bitter and manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise, just as though... in short, they betray something thereby.",
    "Flaubert, for instance, the honest citizen of Rouen, neither saw, heard, nor tasted anything else in the end; it was his mode of self-torment and refined cruelty.",
    "As this is growing wearisome, I would now recommend for a change something else for a pleasure--namely, the unconscious astuteness with which good, fat, honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks they have to perform, the subtle, barbed, Jesuitical astuteness, which is a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the middle-class in its best moments--subtler even than the understanding of its victims:--a repeated proof that \"instinct\" is the most intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered.",
    "In short, you psychologists, study the philosophy of the \"rule\" in its struggle with the \"exception\": there you have a spectacle fit for Gods and godlike malignity!",
    "Or, in plainer words, practise vivisection on \"good people,\" on the \"homo bonae voluntatis,\" ON YOURSELVES!",
    "219.",
    "The practice of judging and condemning morally, is the favourite revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so, it is also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature, and finally, it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMING subtle--malice spiritualises.",
    "They are glad in their inmost heart that there is a standard according to which those who are over-endowed with intellectual goods and privileges, are equal to them, they contend for the \"equality of all before God,\" and almost NEED the belief in God for this purpose.",
    "It is among them that the most powerful antagonists of atheism are found.",
    "If any one were to say to them \"A lofty spirituality is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely moral man\"--it would make them furious, I shall take care not to say so.",
    "I would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities, that it is a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the \"merely moral\" man, after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice, perhaps during a whole series of generations, that lofty spirituality is precisely the spiritualising of justice, and the beneficent severity which knows that it is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the world, even among things--and not only among men.",
    "220.",
    "Now that the praise of the \"disinterested person\" is so popular",
    "one must--probably not without some danger--get an idea of WHAT people actually take an interest in, and what are the things generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men--including the cultured, even the learned, and perhaps philosophers also, if appearances do not deceive.",
    "The fact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more refined and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely \"uninteresting\" to the average man--if, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these interests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to act \"disinterestedly.\"",
    "There have been philosophers who could give this popular astonishment a seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression (perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience?), instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that \"disinterested\" action is very interesting and \"interested\" action, provided that...",
    "\"And love?\"--What!",
    "Even an action for love's sake shall be \"unegoistic\"?",
    "But you fools--!",
    "\"And the praise of the self-sacrificer?\"--But whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that he wanted and obtained something for it--perhaps something from himself for something from himself; that he relinquished here in order to have more there, perhaps in general to be more, or even feel himself \"more.\"",
    "But this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidious spirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to stifle her yawns so much when she is obliged to answer.",
    "And after all, truth is a woman; one must not use force with her.",
    "221.",
    "\"It sometimes happens,\" said a moralistic pedant and trifle-retailer, \"that I honour and respect an unselfish man: not, however, because he is unselfish, but because I think he has a right to be useful to another man at his own expense.",
    "In short, the question is always who HE is, and who THE OTHER is.",
    "For instance, in a person created and destined for command, self-denial and modest retirement, instead of being virtues, would be the waste of virtues: so it seems to me.",
    "Every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself unconditionally and appeals to every one, not only sins against good taste, but is also an incentive to sins of omission, an ADDITIONAL seduction under the mask of philanthropy--and precisely a seduction and injury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of men.",
    "Moral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OF RANK; their presumption must be driven home to their conscience--until they thoroughly understand at last that it is IMMORAL to say that 'what is right for one is proper for another.",
    "'\"--So said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme.",
    "Did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus exhorted systems of morals to practise morality?",

    "I perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape; let others capture it again and give it so much \"milk of pious sentiment\" [FOOTNOTE: An expression from Schiller's William Tell, Act IV, Scene 3.] to drink, that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in its old corner.--One ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open one's eyes; one ought at last to learn impatience, in order that such immodest gross errors--as, for instance, have been fostered by ancient and modern philosophers with regard to tragedy--may no longer wander about virtuously and boldly.",

    "Here, to be sure, we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of former times, which could only teach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the suffering of OTHERS: there is an abundant, super-abundant enjoyment even in one's own suffering, in causing one's own suffering--and wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded to self-denial in the RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation, as among the Phoenicians and ascetics, or in general, to desensualisation, decarnalisation, and contrition, to Puritanical repentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience and to Pascal-like SACRIFIZIA DELL' INTELLETO, he is secretly allured and impelled forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of cruelty TOWARDS HIMSELF.--Finally, let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty, in that he compels his spirit to perceive AGAINST its own inclination, and often enough against the wishes of his heart:--he forces it to say Nay, where he would like to affirm, love, and adore; indeed, every instance of taking a thing profoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an intentional injuring of the fundamental will of the spirit, which instinctively aims at appearance and superficiality,--even in every desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty.",
    "230.",
    "Perhaps what I have said here about a \"fundamental will of the spirit\" may not be understood without further details; I may be allowed a word of explanation.--That imperious something which is popularly called \"the spirit,\" wishes to be master internally and externally, and to feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a simplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will.",
    "Its requirements and capacities here, are the same as those assigned by physiologists to everything that lives, grows, and multiplies.",
    "The power of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong tendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold, to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it arbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself certain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of the \"outside world.\"",
    "Its object thereby is the incorporation of new \"experiences,\" the assortment of new things in the old arrangements--in short, growth; or more properly, the FEELING of growth, the feeling of increased power--is its object.",
    "This same will has at its service an apparently opposed impulse of the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance, of arbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner denial of this or that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive attitude against much that is knowable, a contentment with obscurity, with the shutting-in horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance: as that which is all necessary according to the degree of its appropriating power, its \"digestive power,\" to speak figuratively (and in fact \"the spirit\" resembles a stomach more than anything else).",
    "Here also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived (perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so, but is only allowed to pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity, an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness and mystery, of the too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified, the diminished, the misshapen, the beautified--an enjoyment of the arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power.",
    "Finally, in this connection, there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to deceive other spirits and dissemble before them--the constant pressing and straining of a creating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit enjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys also its feeling of security therein--it is precisely by its Protean arts that it is best protected and concealed!--COUNTER TO this propensity for appearance, for simplification, for a disguise, for a cloak, in short, for an outside--for every outside is a cloak--there operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge, which takes, and INSISTS on taking things profoundly, variously, and thoroughly; as a kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste, which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself, provided, as it ought to be, that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for introspection, and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe words.",
    "He will say: \"There is something cruel in the tendency of my spirit\": let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not so!",
    "In fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty, perhaps our \"extravagant honesty\" were talked about, whispered about, and glorified--we free, VERY free spirits--and some day perhaps SUCH will actually be our--posthumous glory!",
    "Meanwhile--for there is plenty of time until then--we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in such florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work has just made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance.",
    "They are beautiful, glistening, jingling, festive words: honesty, love of truth, love of wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, heroism of the truthful--there is something in them that makes one's heart swell with pride.",
    "But we anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite's conscience, that this worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment, frippery, and gold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and that even under such flattering colour and repainting, the terrible original text HOMO NATURA must again be recognized.",
    "In effect, to translate man back again into nature; to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal original text, HOMO NATURA; to bring it about that man shall henceforth stand before man as he now, hardened by the discipline of science, stands before the OTHER forms of nature, with fearless Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the enticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to him far too long: \"Thou art more!",

    "They want more, they learn to make claims, the tribute of respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights, indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is losing modesty.",
    "And let us immediately add that she is also losing taste.",
    "She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who \"unlearns to fear\" sacrifices her most womanly instincts.",
    "That woman should venture forward when the fear-inspiring quality in man--or more definitely, the MAN in man--is no longer either desired or fully developed, is reasonable enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficult to understand is that precisely thereby--woman deteriorates.",
    "This is what is happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it!",
    "Wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit, woman strives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk: \"woman as clerkess\" is inscribed on the portal of the modern society which is in course of formation.",
    "While she thus appropriates new rights, aspires to be \"master,\" and inscribes \"progress\" of woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite realises itself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES.",
    "Since the French Revolution the influence of woman in Europe has DECLINED in proportion as she has increased her rights and claims; and the \"emancipation of woman,\" insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves (and not only by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instincts.",
    "There is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost masculine stupidity, of which a well-reared woman--who is always a sensible woman--might be heartily ashamed.",
    "To lose the intuition as to the ground upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise in the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man, perhaps even \"to the book,\" where formerly she kept herself in control and in refined, artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man's faith in a VEILED, fundamentally different ideal in woman, something eternally, necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved, cared for, protected, and indulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and often pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of woman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still entails (as though slavery were a counter-argument, and not rather a condition of every higher culture, of every elevation of culture):--what does all this betoken, if not a disintegration of womanly instincts, a defeminising?",
    "Certainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and corrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex, who advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate all the stupidities from which \"man\" in Europe, European \"manliness,\" suffers,--who would like to lower woman to \"general culture,\" indeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics.",
    "Here and there they wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers: as though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and godless man;--almost everywhere her nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music (our latest German music), and she is daily being made more hysterical and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of bearing robust children.",
    "They wish to \"cultivate\" her in general still more, and intend, as they say, to make the \"weaker sex\" STRONG by culture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that the \"cultivating\" of mankind and his weakening--that is to say, the weakening, dissipating, and languishing of his FORCE OF WILL--have always kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and influential women in the world (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon) had just to thank their force of will--and not their schoolmasters--for their power and ascendancy over men.",
    "That which inspires respect in woman, and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more \"natural\" than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning flexibility, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in egoism, her untrainableness and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness, extent, and deviation of her desires and virtues.",
    "That which, in spite of fear, excites one's sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat, \"woman,\" is that she seems more afflicted, more vulnerable, more necessitous of love, and more condemned to disillusionment than any other creature.",
    "Fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot already in tragedy, which rends while it delights--What?",

    "What flavours and forces, what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it!",
    "It impresses us at one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter, and too modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it is not infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarse--it has fire and courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-coloured skin of fruits which ripen too late.",
    "It flows broad and full: and suddenly there is a moment of inexplicable hesitation, like a gap that opens between cause and effect, an oppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but already it broadens and widens anew, the old stream of delight--the most manifold delight,--of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY the joy of the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his astonished, happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here employed, the new, newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art which he apparently betrays to us.",
    "All in all, however, no beauty, no South, nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing of grace, no dance, hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even, which is also emphasized, as though the artist wished to say to us: \"It is part of my intention\"; a cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily barbaric and ceremonious, a flirring of learned and venerable conceits and witticisms; something German in the best and worst sense of the word, something in the German style, manifold, formless, and inexhaustible; a certain German potency and super-plenitude of soul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS of decadence--which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease there; a real, genuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time young and aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity.",

    "Duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confines its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours--in a considerable time: some in half a year, others in half a lifetime, according to the speed and strength with which they digest and \"change their material.\"",
    "Indeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races, which even in our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century ere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and soil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say, to \"good Europeanism.\"",
    "And while digressing on this possibility, I happen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two old patriots--they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently spoke all the louder.",
    "\"HE has as much, and knows as much, philosophy as a peasant or a corps-student,\" said the one--\"he is still innocent.",

    "Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position of being obliged henceforth to practise 'high politics,' for which they were by nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have to sacrifice their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and doubtful mediocrity;--supposing a statesman were to condemn his people generally to 'practise politics,' when they have hitherto had something better to do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of the restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the essentially politics-practising nations;--supposing such a statesman were to stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people, were to make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness, an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to depreciate their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences, make their minds narrow, and their tastes 'national'--what!",
    "a statesman who should do all this, which his people would have to do penance for throughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a statesman would be GREAT, would he?\"--\"Undoubtedly!\"",

    "This process of the EVOLVING EUROPEAN, which can be retarded in its TEMPO by great relapses, but will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth--the still-raging storm and stress of \"national sentiment\" pertains to it, and also the anarchism which is appearing at present--this process will probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and panegyrists, the apostles of \"modern ideas,\" would least care to reckon.",
    "The same new conditions under which on an average a levelling and mediocrising of man will take place--a useful, industrious, variously serviceable, and clever gregarious man--are in the highest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and attractive qualities.",
    "For, while the capacity for adaptation, which is every day trying changing conditions, and begins a new work with every generation, almost with every decade, makes the POWERFULNESS of the type impossible; while the collective impression of such future Europeans will probably be that of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very handy workmen who REQUIRE a master, a commander, as they require their daily bread; while, therefore, the democratising of Europe will tend to the production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle sense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in individual and exceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever been before--owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling, owing to the immense variety of practice, art, and disguise.",

    "Let us try, then, to relearn with regard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose is a little vivisection of the German soul.--The German soul is above all manifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super-imposed, rather than actually built: this is owing to its origin.",
    "A German who would embolden himself to assert: \"Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast,\" would make a bad guess at the truth, or, more correctly, he would come far short of the truth about the number of souls.",
    "As a people made up of the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a preponderance of the pre-Aryan element as the \"people of the centre\" in every sense of the term, the Germans are more intangible, more ample, more contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more surprising, and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves:--they escape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the despair of the French.",

    "It is certain that it was not the \"Wars of Independence\" that made him look up more joyfully, any more than it was the French Revolution,--the event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTED his \"Faust,\" and indeed the whole problem of \"man,\" was the appearance of Napoleon.",

    "The German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with faithful, blue, empty German eyes--and other countries immediately confound him with his dressing-gown!--I meant to say that, let \"German depth\" be what it will--among ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at it--we shall do well to continue henceforth to honour its appearance and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our old reputation as a people of depth for Prussian \"smartness,\" and Berlin wit and sand.",

    "Beethoven is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking down, and a future over-young soul that is always COMING; there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal extravagant hope,--the same light in which Europe was bathed when it dreamed with Rousseau, when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the Revolution, and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon.",
    "But how rapidly does THIS very sentiment now pale, how difficult nowadays is even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment, how strangely does the language of Rousseau, Schiller, Shelley, and Byron sound to our ear, in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe was able to SPEAK, which knew how to SING in Beethoven!--Whatever German music came afterwards, belongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to a movement which, historically considered, was still shorter, more fleeting, and more superficial than that great interlude, the transition of Europe from Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the rise of democracy.",

    "assuredly not like Byron!)--his MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of injustice; Schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY taste (that is to say, a dangerous propensity--doubly dangerous among Germans--for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings), going constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble weakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the beginning a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE--this Schumann was already merely a GERMAN event in music, and no longer a European event, as Beethoven had been, as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German music was threatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.",

    "Those ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti in speaking, consequently connoisseurs, consequently critics--they thus brought their orators to the highest pitch; in the same manner as in the last century, when all Italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song (and with it also the art of melody) reached its elevation.",

    "The preacher was the only one in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a sentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone had a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for reasons are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom attained by a German, or almost always too late.",

    "It is certain that the Jews, if they desired--or if they were driven to it, as the anti-Semites seem to wish--COULD now have the ascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they are NOT working and planning for that end is equally certain.",
    "Meanwhile, they rather wish and desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and absorbed by Europe, they long to be finally settled, authorized, and respected somewhere, and wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the \"wandering Jew\",--and one should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency, and MAKE ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation of the Jewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful and fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country.",
    "One should make advances with all prudence, and with selection, pretty much as the English nobility do It stands to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked types of new Germanism could enter into relation with the Jews with the least hesitation, for instance, the nobleman officer from the Prussian border it would be interesting in many ways to see whether the genius for money and patience (and especially some intellect and intellectuality--sadly lacking in the place referred to) could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of commanding and obeying--for both of which the country in question has now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break off my festal discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have already reached my SERIOUS TOPIC, the \"European problem,\" as I understand it, the rearing of a new ruling caste for Europe.",
    "252.",
    "They are not a philosophical race--the English: Bacon represents an ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally, Hobbes, Hume, and Locke, an abasement, and a depreciation of the idea of a \"philosopher\" for more than a century.",
    "It was AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself; it was Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said, \"JE MEPRISE LOCKE\"; in the struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world, Hegel and Schopenhauer (along with Goethe) were of one accord; the two hostile brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different directions towards the opposite poles of German thought, and thereby wronged each other as only brothers will do.--What is lacking in England, and has always been lacking, that half-actor and rhetorician knew well enough, the absurd muddle-head, Carlyle, who sought to conceal under passionate grimaces what he knew about himself: namely, what was LACKING in Carlyle--real POWER of intellect, real DEPTH of intellectual perception, in short, philosophy.",
    "It is characteristic of such an unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianity--they NEED its discipline for \"moralizing\" and humanizing.",
    "The Englishman, more gloomy, sensual, headstrong, and brutal than the German--is for that very reason, as the baser of the two, also the most pious: he has all the MORE NEED of Christianity.",
    "To finer nostrils, this English Christianity itself has still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic excess, for which, owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidote--the finer poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning is in fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people, a step towards spiritualization.",
    "The English coarseness and rustic demureness is still most satisfactorily disguised by Christian pantomime, and by praying and psalm-singing (or, more correctly, it is thereby explained and differently expressed); and for the herd of drunkards and rakes who formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism (and more recently as the \"Salvation Army\"), a penitential fit may really be the relatively highest manifestation of \"humanity\" to which they can be elevated: so much may reasonably be admitted.",
    "That, however, which offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music, to speak figuratively (and also literally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul and body; indeed, not even the desire for rhythm and dance, for \"music.\"",

    "Indeed, who could doubt that it is a useful thing for SUCH minds to have the ascendancy for a time?",
    "It would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently soaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting many little common facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions, they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards those who are \"the rules.\"",
    "After all, they have more to do than merely to perceive:--in effect, they have to BE something new, they have to SIGNIFY something new, they have to REPRESENT new values!",
    "The gulf between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater, and also more mysterious, than one thinks: the capable man in the grand style, the creator, will possibly have to be an ignorant person;--while on the other hand, for scientific discoveries like those of Darwin, a certain narrowness, aridity, and industrious carefulness (in short, something English) may not be unfavourable for arriving at them.--Finally, let it not be forgotten that the English, with their profound mediocrity, brought about once before a general depression of European intelligence.",
    "What is called \"modern ideas,\" or \"the ideas of the eighteenth century,\" or \"French ideas\"--that, consequently, against which the GERMAN mind rose up with profound disgust--is of English origin, there is no doubt about it.",

    "their first and profoundest VICTIMS; for owing to the diabolical Anglomania of \"modern ideas,\" the AME FRANCAIS has in the end become so thin and emaciated, that at present one recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its profound, passionate strength, its inventive excellency, almost with disbelief.",
    "One must, however, maintain this verdict of historical justice in a determined manner, and defend it against present prejudices and appearances: the European NOBLESSE--of sentiment, taste, and manners, taking the word in every high sense--is the work and invention of FRANCE; the European ignobleness, the plebeianism of modern ideas--is ENGLAND'S work and invention.",

    "They have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic BOURGEOIS.",
    "In fact, a besotted and brutalized France at present sprawls in the foreground--it recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste, and at the same time of self-admiration, at the funeral of Victor Hugo.",
    "There is also something else common to them: a predilection to resist intellectual Germanizing--and a still greater inability to do so!",
    "In this France of intellect, which is also a France of pessimism, Schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more indigenous than he has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine, who has long ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists of Paris; or of Hegel, who at present, in the form of Taine--the FIRST of living historians--exercises an almost tyrannical influence.",
    "As regards Richard Wagner, however, the more French music learns to adapt itself to the actual needs of the AME MODERNE, the more will it \"Wagnerite\"; one can safely predict that beforehand,--it is already taking place sufficiently!",
    "There are, however, three things which the French can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession, and as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority in Europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and vulgarizing of taste.",
    "FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic emotion, for devotion to \"form,\" for which the expression, L'ART POUR L'ART, along with numerous others, has been invented:--such capacity has not been lacking in France for three centuries; and owing to its reverence for the \"small number,\" it has again and again made a sort of chamber music of literature possible, which is sought for in vain elsewhere in Europe.--The SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim to a superiority over Europe is their ancient, many-sided, MORALISTIC culture, owing to which one finds on an average, even in the petty ROMANCIERS of the newspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS, a psychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one has no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany.",
    "The Germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite thereto, which, as we have said, France has not grudged: those who call the Germans \"naive\" on that account give them commendation for a defect.",
    "(As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE PSYCHOLOGICA, which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness of German intercourse,--and as the most successful expression of genuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate thrills, Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory and forerunning man, who, with a Napoleonic TEMPO, traversed HIS Europe, in fact, several centuries of the European soul, as a surveyor and discoverer thereof:--it has required two generations to OVERTAKE him one way or other, to divine long afterwards some of the riddles that perplexed and enraptured him--this strange Epicurean and man of interrogation, the last great psychologist of France).--There is yet a THIRD claim to superiority: in the French character there is a successful half-way synthesis of the North and South, which makes them comprehend many things, and enjoins upon them other things, which an Englishman can never comprehend.",
    "Their temperament, turned alternately to and from the South, in which from time to time the Provencal and Ligurian blood froths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern grey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty of blood--our GERMAN infirmity of taste, for the excessive prevalence of which at the present moment, blood and iron, that is to say \"high politics,\" has with great resolution been prescribed (according to a dangerous healing art, which bids me wait and wait, but not yet hope).--There is also still in France a pre-understanding and ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men, who are too comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism, and know how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the South--the born Midlanders, the \"good Europeans.\"",

    "255.",
    "I hold that many precautions should be taken against German music.",
    "Suppose a person loves the South as I love it--as a great school of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills, as a boundless solar profusion and effulgence which o'erspreads a sovereign existence believing in itself--well, such a person will learn to be somewhat on his guard against German music, because, in injuring his taste anew, it will also injure his health anew.",
    "Such a Southerner, a Southerner not by origin but by BELIEF, if he should dream of the future of music, must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the North; and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and perhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-German music, which does not fade, pale, and die away, as all German music does, at the sight of the blue, wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of sky--a super-European music, which holds its own even in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert, whose soul is akin to the palm-tree, and can be at home and can roam with big, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey...",
    "I could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of good and evil; only that here and there perhaps some sailor's home-sickness, some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might sweep lightly over it; an art which, from the far distance, would see the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing towards it, and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to receive such belated fugitives.",
    "256.",
    "Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze has induced and still induces among the nations of Europe, owing also to the short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with the help of this craze, are at present in power, and do not suspect to what extent the disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude policy--owing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable at present, the most unmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE, are now overlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted.",
    "With all the more profound and large-minded men of this century, the real general tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way for that new SYNTHESIS, and tentatively to anticipate the European of the future; only in their simulations, or in their weaker moments, in old age perhaps, did they belong to the \"fatherlands\"--they only rested from themselves when they became \"patriots.\"",
    "I think of such men as Napoleon, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: it must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them, about whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings (geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves), still less, of course, by the unseemly noise with which he is now resisted and opposed in France: the fact remains, nevertheless, that Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forties, are most closely and intimately related to one another.",
    "They are akin, fundamentally akin, in all the heights and depths of their requirements; it is Europe, the ONE Europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly, outwards and upwards, in their multifarious and boisterous art--whither?",
    "into a new light?",
    "towards a new sun?",
    "But who would attempt to express accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not express distinctly?",
    "It is certain that the same storm and stress tormented them, that they SOUGHT in the same manner, these last great seekers!",
    "All of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears--the first artists of universal literary culture--for the most part even themselves writers, poets, intermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses (Wagner, as musician is reckoned among painters, as poet among musicians, as artist generally among actors); all of them fanatics for EXPRESSION \"at any cost\"--I specially mention Delacroix, the nearest related to Wagner; all of them great discoverers in the realm of the sublime, also of the loathsome and dreadful, still greater discoverers in effect, in display, in the art of the show-shop; all of them talented far beyond their genius, out and out VIRTUOSI, with mysterious accesses to all that seduces, allures, constrains, and upsets; born enemies of logic and of the straight line, hankering after the strange, the exotic, the monstrous, the crooked, and the self-contradictory; as men, Tantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus, who knew themselves to be incapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life and action--think of Balzac, for instance,--unrestrained workers, almost destroying themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners, ambitious and insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all of them finally shattering and sinking down at the Christian cross (and with right and reason, for who of them would have been sufficiently profound and sufficiently original for an ANTI-CHRISTIAN philosophy?);--on the whole, a boldly daring, splendidly overbearing, high-flying, and aloft-up-dragging class of higher men, who had first to teach their century--and it is the century of the MASSES--the conception \"higher man.\"...",
    "Let the German friends of Richard Wagner advise together as to whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art, or whether its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from SUPER-GERMAN sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be underrated how indispensable Paris was to the development of his type, which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most decisive time--and how the whole style of his proceedings, of his self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in sight of the French socialistic original.",
    "On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be found, to the honour of Richard Wagner's German nature, that he has acted in everything with more strength, daring, severity, and elevation than a nineteenth-century Frenchman could have done--owing to the circumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the French;--perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is not only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried, that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too cheerful, too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow civilized nations.",
    "He may even have been a sin against Romanticism, this anti-Latin Siegfried: well, Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old sad days, when--anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into politics--he began, with the religious vehemence peculiar to him, to preach, at least, THE WAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.--That these last words may not be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few powerful rhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what I mean--what I mean COUNTER TO the \"last Wagner\" and his Parsifal music:-- --Is this our mode?--From German heart came this vexed ululating?",
    "From German body, this self-lacerating?",
    "Is ours this priestly hand-dilation, This incense-fuming exaltation?",
    "Is ours this faltering, falling, shambling, This quite uncertain ding-dong-dangling?",
    "This sly nun-ogling, Ave-hour-bell ringing, This wholly false enraptured heaven-o'erspringing?--Is this our mode?--Think well!--ye still wait for admission--For what ye hear is ROME--ROME'S FAITH BY INTUITION!",

    "WHAT IS NOBLE?",

    "EVERY elevation of the type \"man,\" has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be--a society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings, and requiring slavery in some form or other.",
    "Without the PATHOS OF DISTANCE, such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes, out of the constant out-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste on subordinates and instruments, and out of their equally constant practice of obeying and commanding, of keeping down and keeping at a distance--that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen, the longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself, the formation of ever higher, rarer, further, more extended, more comprehensive states, in short, just the elevation of the type \"man,\" the continued \"self-surmounting of man,\" to use a moral formula in a supermoral sense.",
    "To be sure, one must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of an aristocratic society (that is to say, of the preliminary condition for the elevation of the type \"man\"): the truth is hard.",
    "Let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has ORIGINATED!",
    "Men with a still natural nature, barbarians in every terrible sense of the word, men of prey, still in possession of unbroken strength of will and desire for power, threw themselves upon weaker, more moral, more peaceful races (perhaps trading or cattle-rearing communities), or upon old mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering out in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity.",
    "At the commencement, the noble caste was always the barbarian caste: their superiority did not consist first of all in their physical, but in their psychical power--they were more COMPLETE men (which at every point also implies the same as \"more complete beasts\").",
    "258.",
    "Corruption--as the indication that anarchy threatens to break out among the instincts, and that the foundation of the emotions, called \"life,\" is convulsed--is something radically different according to the organization in which it manifests itself.",
    "When, for instance, an aristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolution, flung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an excess of its moral sentiments, it was corruption:--it was really only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuries, by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty (in the end even to its decoration and parade-dress).",
    "The essential thing, however, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard itself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth, but as the SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereof--that it should therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individuals, who, FOR ITS SAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men, to slaves and instruments.",
    "Its fundamental belief must be precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake, but only as a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties, and in general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun-seeking climbing plants in Java--they are called Sipo Matador,--which encircle an oak so long and so often with their arms, until at last, high above it, but supported by it, they can unfold their tops in the open light, and exhibit their happiness.",
    "259.",
    "To refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from exploitation, and put one's will on a par with that of others: this may result in a certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary conditions are given (namely, the actual similarity of the individuals in amount of force and degree of worth, and their co-relation within one organization).",
    "As soon, however, as one wished to take this principle more generally, and if possible even as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY, it would immediately disclose what it really is--namely, a Will to the DENIAL of life, a principle of dissolution and decay.",
    "Here one must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental weakness: life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of peculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest, exploitation;--but why should one for ever use precisely these words on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped?",
    "Even the organization within which, as was previously supposed, the individuals treat each other as equal--it takes place in every healthy aristocracy--must itself, if it be a living and not a dying organization, do all that towards other bodies, which the individuals within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the incarnated Will to Power, it will endeavour to grow, to gain ground, attract to itself and acquire ascendancy--not owing to any morality or immorality, but because it LIVES, and because life IS precisely Will to Power.",
    "On no point, however, is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter, people now rave everywhere, even under the guise of science, about coming conditions of society in which \"the exploiting character\" is to be absent--that sounds to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should refrain from all organic functions.",
    "\"Exploitation\" does not belong to a depraved, or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of the living being as a primary organic function, it is a consequence of the intrinsic Will to Power, which is precisely the Will to Life--Granting that as a theory this is a novelty--as a reality it is the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let us be so far honest towards ourselves!",
    "260.",
    "In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I found certain traits recurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until finally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical distinction was brought to light.",
    "There is MASTER-MORALITY and SLAVE-MORALITY,--I would at once add, however, that in all higher and mixed civilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of the two moralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and mutual misunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close juxtaposition--even in the same man, within one soul.",
    "The distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled--or among the ruled class, the slaves and dependents of all sorts.",
    "In the first case, when it is the rulers who determine the conception \"good,\" it is the exalted, proud disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which determines the order of rank.",
    "The noble type of man separates from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud disposition displays itself he despises them.",
    "Let it at once be noted that in this first kind of morality the antithesis \"good\" and \"bad\" means practically the same as \"noble\" and \"despicable\",--the antithesis \"good\" and \"EVIL\" is of a different origin.",
    "The cowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised; moreover, also, the distrustful, with their constrained glances, the self-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused, the mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:--it is a fundamental belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful.",
    "\"We truthful ones\"--the nobility in ancient Greece called themselves.",
    "It is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to MEN; and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals start with questions like, \"Why have sympathetic actions been praised?\"",
    "The noble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he does not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: \"What is injurious to me is injurious in itself;\" he knows that it is he himself only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES.",
    "He honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals self-glorification.",
    "In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude, of power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:--the noble man also helps the unfortunate, but not--or scarcely--out of pity, but rather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power.",
    "The noble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power over himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has reverence for all that is severe and hard.",
    "\"Wotan placed a hard heart in my breast,\" says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly expressed from the soul of a proud Viking.",
    "Such a type of man is even proud of not being made for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly: \"He who has not a hard heart when young, will never have one.\"",
    "The noble and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality which sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others, or in DESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards \"selflessness,\" belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the \"warm heart.",
    "\"--It is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain for invention.",
    "The profound reverence for age and for tradition--all law rests on this double reverence,--the belief and prejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of the powerful; and if, reversely, men of \"modern ideas\" believe almost instinctively in \"progress\" and the \"future,\" and are more and more lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these \"ideas\" has complacently betrayed itself thereby.",
    "A morality of the ruling class, however, is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day taste in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's equals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as seems good to one, or \"as the heart desires,\" and in any case \"beyond good and evil\": it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a place.",
    "The ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge--both only within the circle of equals,--artfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea in friendship, a certain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance--in fact, in order to be a good FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble morality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of \"modern ideas,\" and is therefore at present difficult to realize, and also to unearth and disclose.--It is otherwise with the second type of morality, SLAVE-MORALITY.",
    "Supposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should moralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates?",
    "Probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together with his situation.",
    "The slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the powerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of everything \"good\" that is there honoured--he would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine.",
    "On the other hand, THOSE qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and flooded with light; it is here that sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence, humility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the most useful qualities, and almost the only means of supporting the burden of existence.",
    "Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility.",
    "Here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis \"good\" and \"evil\":--power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do not admit of being despised.",
    "According to slave-morality, therefore, the \"evil\" man arouses fear; according to master-morality, it is precisely the \"good\" man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being.",
    "The contrast attains its maximum when, in accordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality, a shade of depreciation--it may be slight and well-intentioned--at last attaches itself to the \"good\" man of this morality; because, according to the servile mode of thought, the good man must in any case be the SAFE man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little stupid, un bonhomme.",
    "Everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy, language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words \"good\" and \"stupid.\"--A",
    "last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM, the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.--Hence we can understand without further detail why love AS A PASSION--it is our European specialty--must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its invention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant, ingenious men of the \"gai saber,\" to whom Europe owes so much, and almost owes itself.",
    "261.",
    "Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for a noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another kind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently.",
    "The problem for him is to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of themselves which they themselves do not possess--and consequently also do not \"deserve,\"--and who yet BELIEVE in this good opinion afterwards.",
    "This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so self-disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable, that he would like to consider vanity an exception, and is doubtful about it in most cases when it is spoken of.",
    "He will say, for instance: \"I may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely as I rate it:--that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit, or, in most cases, that which is called 'humility,' and also 'modesty').\"",
    "Or he will even say: \"For many reasons I can delight in the good opinion of others, perhaps because I love and honour them, and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion, perhaps because the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do not share it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:--all this, however, is not vanity.\"",
    "The man of noble character must first bring it home forcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history, that, from time immemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary man WAS only that which he PASSED FOR:--not being at all accustomed to fix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value than that which his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to create values).",
    "It may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary atavism, that the ordinary man, even at present, is still always WAITING for an opinion about himself, and then instinctively submitting himself to it; yet by no means only to a \"good\" opinion, but also to a bad and unjust one (think, for instance, of the greater part of the self-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn from their confessors, and which in general the believing Christian learns from his Church).",
    "In fact, conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order (and its cause, the blending of the blood of masters and slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to \"think well\" of themselves, will now be more and more encouraged and extended; but it has at all times an older, ampler, and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it--and in the phenomenon of \"vanity\" this older propensity overmasters the younger.",
    "The vain person rejoices over EVERY good opinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point of view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjects himself to both, he feels himself subjected to both, by that oldest instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.--It is \"the slave\" in the vain man's blood, the remains of the slave's craftiness--and how much of the \"slave\" is still left in woman, for instance!--which seeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions, as though he had not called them forth.--And to repeat it again: vanity is an atavism.",

    "A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and strong in the long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE conditions.",
    "On the other hand, it is known by the experience of breeders that species which receive super-abundant nourishment, and in general a surplus of protection and care, immediately tend in the most marked way to develop variations, and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in monstrous vices).",
    "Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say an ancient Greek polis, or Venice, as a voluntary or involuntary contrivance for the purpose of REARING human beings; there are there men beside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who want to make their species prevail, chiefly because they MUST prevail, or else run the terrible danger of being exterminated.",
    "The favour, the super-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which variations are fostered; the species needs itself as species, as something which, precisely by virtue of its hardness, its uniformity, and simplicity of structure, can in general prevail and make itself permanent in constant struggle with its neighbours, or with rebellious or rebellion-threatening vassals.",
    "The most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists, in spite of all Gods and men, and has hitherto been victorious: these qualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone it develops to maturity.",
    "It does so with severity, indeed it desires severity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education of youth, in the control of women, in the marriage customs, in the relations of old and young, in the penal laws (which have an eye only for the degenerating): it counts intolerance itself among the virtues, under the name of \"justice.\"",
    "A type with few, but very marked features, a species of severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and reticent men (and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and nuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the vicissitudes of generations; the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLE conditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a type becoming stable and hard.",
    "Finally, however, a happy state of things results, the enormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more enemies among the neighbouring peoples, and the means of life, even of the enjoyment of life, are present in superabundance.",
    "With one stroke the bond and constraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as necessary, as a condition of existence--if it would continue, it can only do so as a form of LUXURY, as an archaizing TASTE.",
    "Variations, whether they be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or deteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individual and detach himself.",
    "At this turning-point of history there manifest themselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving, a kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary decay and self-destruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms, which strive with one another \"for sun and light,\" and can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality.",
    "It was this morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously, which bent the bow in so threatening a manner:--it is now \"out of date,\" it is getting \"out of date.\"",
    "The dangerous and disquieting point has been reached when the greater, more manifold, more comprehensive life IS LIVED BEYOND the old morality; the \"individual\" stands out, and is obliged to have recourse to his own law-giving, his own arts and artifices for self-preservation, self-elevation, and self-deliverance.",
    "Nothing but new \"Whys,\" nothing but new \"Hows,\" no common formulas any longer, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay, deterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled, the genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad, a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn, full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still inexhausted, still unwearied corruption.",
    "Danger is again present, the mother of morality, great danger; this time shifted into the individual, into the neighbour and friend, into the street, into their own child, into their own heart, into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions.",
    "What will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach?",
    "They discover, these sharp onlookers and loafers, that the end is quickly approaching, that everything around them decays and produces decay, that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow, except one species of man, the incurably MEDIOCRE.",
    "The mediocre alone have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves--they will be the men of the future, the sole survivors; \"be like them!",
    "become mediocre!\"",
    "is now the only morality which has still a significance, which still obtains a hearing.--But it is difficult to preach this morality of mediocrity!",

    "He whose task and practice it is to investigate souls, will avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine the ultimate value of a soul, the unalterable, innate order of rank to which it belongs: he will test it by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE.",
    "DIFFERENCE ENGENDRE HAINE: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like dirty water, when any holy vessel, any jewel from closed shrines, any book bearing the marks of great destiny, is brought before it; while on the other hand, there is an involuntary silence, a hesitation of the eye, a cessation of all gestures, by which it is indicated that a soul FEELS the nearness of what is worthiest of respect.",
    "The way in which, on the whole, the reverence for the BIBLE has hitherto been maintained in Europe, is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of manners which Europe owes to Christianity: books of such profoundness and supreme significance require for their protection an external tyranny of authority, in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousands of years which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them.",
    "Much has been achieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses (the shallow-pates and the boobies of every kind) that they are not allowed to touch everything, that there are holy experiences before which they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand--it is almost their highest advance towards humanity.",
    "On the contrary, in the so-called cultured classes, the believers in \"modern ideas,\" nothing is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame, the easy insolence of eye and hand with which they touch, taste, and finger everything; and it is possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE nobility of taste, and more tact for reverence among the people, among the lower classes of the people, especially among peasants, than among the newspaper-reading DEMIMONDE of intellect, the cultured class.",

    "It cannot be effaced from a man's soul what his ancestors have preferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligent economizers attached to a desk and a cash-box, modest and citizen-like in their desires, modest also in their virtues; or whether they were accustomed to commanding from morning till night, fond of rude pleasures and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities; or whether, finally, at one time or another, they have sacrificed old privileges of birth and possession, in order to live wholly for their faith--for their \"God,\"--as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience, which blushes at every compromise.",
    "It is quite impossible for a man NOT to have the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his constitution, whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary.",
    "This is the problem of race.",
    "Granted that one knows something of the parents, it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kind of offensive incontinence, any kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy self-vaunting--the three things which together have constituted the genuine plebeian type in all times--such must pass over to the child, as surely as bad blood; and with the help of the best education and culture one will only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredity.--And what else does education and culture try to do nowadays!",

    "The noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question, and also without consciousness of harshness, constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things:--if he sought a designation for it he would say: \"It is justice itself.\"",
    "He acknowledges under certain circumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that there are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this question of rank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged ones with the same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect, which he enjoys in intercourse with himself--in accordance with an innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand.",
    "It is an ADDITIONAL instance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation in intercourse with his equals--every star is a similar egoist; he honours HIMSELF in them, and in the rights which he concedes to them, he has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights, as the ESSENCE of all intercourse, belongs also to the natural condition of things.",
    "The noble soul gives as he takes, prompted by the passionate and sensitive instinct of requital, which is at the root of his nature.",
    "The notion of \"favour\" has, INTER PARES, neither significance nor good repute; there may be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one from above, and of drinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for those arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude.",

    "In all souls a like number of frequently recurring experiences have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: about these matters people understand one another rapidly and always more rapidly--the history of language is the history of a process of abbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension people always unite closer and closer.",

    "What does the word \"noble\" still mean for us nowadays?",
    "How does the noble man betray himself, how is he recognized under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism, by which everything is rendered opaque and leaden?--It is not his actions which establish his claim--actions are always ambiguous, always inscrutable; neither is it his \"works.\"",
    "One finds nowadays among artists and scholars plenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing for nobleness impels them; but this very NEED of nobleness is radically different from the needs of the noble soul itself, and is in fact the eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof.",
    "It is not the works, but the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines the order of rank--to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper meaning--it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, is not to be lost.--THE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR ITSELF.-- 288.",
    "There are men who are unavoidably intellectual, let them turn and twist themselves as they will, and hold their hands before their treacherous eyes--as though the hand were not a betrayer; it always comes out at last that they have something which they hide--namely, intellect.",
    "One of the subtlest means of deceiving, at least as long as possible, and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider than one really is--which in everyday life is often as desirable as an umbrella,--is called ENTHUSIASM, including what belongs to it, for instance, virtue.",

    "He who has sat day and night, from year's end to year's end, alone with his soul in familiar discord and discourse, he who has become a cave-bear, or a treasure-seeker, or a treasure-guardian and dragon in his cave--it may be a labyrinth, but can also be a gold-mine--his ideas themselves eventually acquire a twilight-colour of their own, and an odour, as much of the depth as of the mould, something uncommunicative and repulsive, which blows chilly upon every passer-by.",
    "The recluse does not believe that a philosopher--supposing that a philosopher has always in the first place been a recluse--ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions in books: are not books written precisely to hide what is in us?--indeed, he will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have \"ultimate and actual\" opinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not, and must necessarily be, a still deeper cave: an ampler, stranger, richer world beyond the surface, an abyss behind every bottom, beneath every \"foundation.\"",
    "Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy--this is a recluse's verdict: \"There is something arbitrary in the fact that the PHILOSOPHER came to a stand here, took a retrospect, and looked around; that he HERE laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper--there is also something suspicious in it.\"",

    "Man, a COMPLEX, mendacious, artful, and inscrutable animal, uncanny to the other animals by his artifice and sagacity, rather than by his strength, has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his soul as something SIMPLE; and the whole of morality is a long, audacious falsification, by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of the soul becomes possible.",
    "From this point of view there is perhaps much more in the conception of \"art\" than is generally believed.",

    "A philosopher: that is a man who constantly experiences, sees, hears, suspects, hopes, and dreams extraordinary things; who is struck by his own thoughts as if they came from the outside, from above and below, as a species of events and lightning-flashes PECULIAR TO HIM; who is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings; a portentous man, around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and something uncanny going on.",

    "THAT sympathy has value!",
    "But of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer!",
    "Or of those even who preach sympathy!",
    "There is nowadays, throughout almost the whole of Europe, a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain, and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining, an effeminizing, which, with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense, seeks to deck itself out as something superior--there is a regular cult of suffering.",
    "The UNMANLINESS of that which is called \"sympathy\" by such groups of visionaries, is always, I believe, the first thing that strikes the eye.--One must resolutely and radically taboo this latest form of bad taste; and finally I wish people to put the good amulet, \"GAI SABER\" (\"gay science,\" in ordinary language), on heart and neck, as a protection against it.",

    "THE OLYMPIAN VICE.--Despite the philosopher who, as a genuine Englishman, tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking minds--\"Laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature, which every thinking mind will strive to overcome\" (Hobbes),--I would even allow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of their laughing--up to those who are capable of GOLDEN laughter.",
    "And supposing that Gods also philosophize, which I am strongly inclined to believe, owing to many reasons--I have no doubt that they also know how to laugh thereby in an overman-like and new fashion--and at the expense of all serious things!",

    "The genius of the heart, as that great mysterious one possesses it, the tempter-god and born rat-catcher of consciences, whose voice can descend into the nether-world of every soul, who neither speaks a word nor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch of allurement, to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to appear,--not as he is, but in a guise which acts as an ADDITIONAL constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him, to follow him more cordially and thoroughly;--the genius of the heart, which imposes silence and attention on everything loud and self-conceited, which smoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing--to lie placid as a mirror, that the deep heavens may be reflected in them;--the genius of the heart, which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate, and to grasp more delicately; which scents the hidden and forgotten treasure, the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark ice, and is a divining-rod for every grain of gold, long buried and imprisoned in mud and sand; the genius of the heart, from contact with which every one goes away richer; not favoured or surprised, not as though gratified and oppressed by the good things of others; but richer in himself, newer than before, broken up, blown upon, and sounded by a thawing wind; more uncertain, perhaps, more delicate, more fragile, more bruised, but full of hopes which as yet lack names, full of a new will and current, full of a new ill-will and counter-current... but what am I doing, my friends?",
    "Of whom am I talking to you?",
    "Have I forgotten myself so far that I have not even told you his name?",
    "Unless it be that you have already divined of your own accord who this questionable God and spirit is, that wishes to be PRAISED in such a manner?",
    "For, as it happens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his legs, and in foreign lands, I have also encountered on my path many strange and dangerous spirits; above all, however, and again and again, the one of whom I have just spoken: in fact, no less a personage than the God DIONYSUS, the great equivocator and tempter, to whom, as you know, I once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first-fruits--the last, as it seems to me, who has offered a SACRIFICE to him, for I have found no one who could understand what I was then doing.",
    "In the meantime, however, I have learned much, far too much, about the philosophy of this God, and, as I said, from mouth to mouth--I, the last disciple and initiate of the God Dionysus: and perhaps I might at last begin to give you, my friends, as far as I am allowed, a little taste of this philosophy?",
    "In a hushed voice, as is but seemly: for it has to do with much that is secret, new, strange, wonderful, and uncanny.",
    "The very fact that Dionysus is a philosopher, and that therefore Gods also philosophize, seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers;--among you, my friends, there is less to be said against it, except that it comes too late and not at the right time; for, as it has been disclosed to me, you are loth nowadays to believe in God and gods.",
    "It may happen, too, that in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the strict usages of your ears?",
    "Certainly the God in question went further, very much further, in such dialogues, and was always many paces ahead of me...",
    "Indeed, if it were allowed, I should have to give him, according to human usage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, I should have to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless honesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom.",
    "But such a God does not know what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp.",
    "\"Keep that,\" he would say, \"for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require it!",
    "I--have no reason to cover my nakedness!\"",
    "One suspects that this kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame?--He once said: \"Under certain circumstances I love mankind\"--and referred thereby to Ariadne, who was present; \"in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave, inventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his way even through all labyrinths.",
    "I like man, and often think how I can still further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more profound.",
    "\"--\"Stronger, more evil, and more profound?\"",
    "I asked in horror.",
    "\"Yes,\" he said again, \"stronger, more evil, and more profound; also more beautiful\"--and thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile, as though he had just paid some charming compliment.",
    "One here sees at once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks;--and in general there are good grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could all of them come to us men for instruction.",

    "Ecce Homo_ is the last prose work that Nietzsche wrote.",
    "It is true that the pamphlet _Nietzsche contra Wagner_ was prepared a month later than the Autobiography; but we cannot consider this pamphlet as anything more than a compilation, seeing that it consists entirely of aphorisms drawn from such previous works as _Joyful Wisdom, Beyond Good and Evil, The Genealogy of Morals,_ etc.",
    "Coming at the end of a year in which he had produced the _Case of Wagner, The Twilight of the Idols,_ and _The Antichrist, Ecce Homo_ is not only a coping-stone worthy of the wonderful creations of that year, but also a fitting conclusion to his whole life, in the form of a grand summing up of his character as a man, his purpose as a reformer, and his achievement as a thinker.",
    "As if half conscious of his approaching spiritual end, Nietzsche here bids his friends farewell, just in the manner in which, in the _Twilight of the Idols_ (Aph.",
    "36, Part ix.), he declares that every one should be able to take leave of his circle of relatives and intimates when his time seems to have come--that is to say, while he is still _himself_ while he still knows what he is about, and is able to measure his own life and life in general, and speak of both in a manner which is not vouchsafed to the groaning invalid, to the man lying on his back, decrepit and exhausted, or to the moribund victim of some wasting disease.",
    "Nietzsche's spiritual death, like his whole life, was in singular harmony with his doctrine: he died suddenly and proudly,--sword in hand.",
    "War, which he--and he alone among all the philosophers of Christendom--had praised so whole-heartedly, at last struck him down in the full vigour of his manhood, and left him a victim on the battlefield--the terrible battlefield of thought, on which there is no quarter, and for which no Geneva Convention has yet been established or even thought of.",
    "To those who know Nietzsche's life-work, no apology will be needed for the form and content of this wonderful work.",
    "They will know, at least, that a man either is, or is not, aware of his significance and of the significance of what he has accomplished, and that if he is aware of it, then self-realisation, even of the kind which we find in these pages, is neither morbid nor suspicious, but necessary and inevitable.",
    "Such chapter headings as \"Why I am so Wise,\" \"Why I am a Fatality,\" \"Why I write such Excellent Books,\"--however much they may have disturbed the equanimity, and \"objectivity\" in particular, of certain Nietzsche biographers, can be regarded as pathological only in a democratic age in which people have lost all sense of graduation and rank and in which the virtues of modesty and humility have to be preached far and wide as a corrective against the vulgar pretensions of thousands of wretched nobodies.",
    "For little people can be endured only as modest citizens; or humble Christians.",
    "If, however, they demand a like modesty on the part of the truly great; if they raise their voices against Nietzsche's lack of the very virtue they so abundantly possess or pretend to possess, it is time to remind them of Goethe's famous remark: \"_Nur Lumpe sind bescheiden_\"",
    "(Only nobodies are ever modest).",
    "It took Nietzsche barely three weeks to write this story of his life.",
    "Begun on the 15th of October 1888, his four-and-fourtieth birthday, it was finished on the 4th of November of the same year, and, but for a few trifling modifications and additions, is just as Nietzsche left it.",
    "It was not published in Germany until the year 1908, eight years after Nietzsche's death.",
    "In a letter dated the 27th of December 1888, addressed to the musical composer Fuchs, the author declares the object of the work to be to dispose of all discussion, doubt, and inquiry concerning his own personality, in order to leave the public mind free to consider merely \"the things for the sake of which he existed\" (\"_die Dinge, derentwegen ich da bin_\").",
    "And, true to his intention, Nietzsche's honesty in these pages is certainly one of the most remarkable features about them.",
    "From the first chapter, in which he frankly acknowledges the decadent elements within him, to the last page, whereon he characterises his mission, his life-task, and his achievement, by means of the one symbol, _Dionysus_ versus _Christ,_--everything comes straight from the shoulder, without hesitation, without fear of consequences, and, above all, without concealment.",
    "Only in one place does he appear to conceal something, and then he actually leads one to understand that he is doing so.",
    "It is in regard to Wagner, the greatest friend of his life.",
    "\"Who doubts,\" he says, \"that I, old artillery-man that I am, would be able if I liked to point my heavy guns at Wagner?\"--But he adds: \"Everything decisive in this question I kept to myself--I have loved Wagner\" (p. 122).",
    "To point, as many have done, to the proximity of all Nietzsche's autumn work of the year 1888 to his breakdown at the beginning of 1889, and to argue that in all its main features it foretells the catastrophe that is imminent, seems a little too plausible, a little too obvious and simple to require refutation.",
    "That Nietzsche really was in a state which in medicine is known as _euphoria_--that is to say, that state of highest well-being and capacity which often precedes a complete breakdown, cannot, I suppose, be questioned; for his style, his penetrating vision, and his vigour, reach their zenith in the works written in this autumn of 1888; but the contention that the matter, the substance, of these works reveals any signs whatsoever of waning mental health, or, as a certain French biographer has it, of an inability to \"hold himself and his judgments in check,\" is best contradicted by the internal evidence itself.",
    "To take just a few examples at random, examine the cold and calculating tone of self-analysis in Chapter I. of the present work; consider the reserve and the restraint with which the idea in Aphorism 7 of that chapter is worked out,--not to speak of the restraint and self-mastery in the idea itself, namely:-- \"To be one's enemy's equal--this is the first condition of an honourable duel.",
    "Where one despises one cannot wage war.",
    "Where one commands, where one sees something beneath one, one ought not to wage war.",
    "My war tactics can be reduced to four principles:",
    "First, I attack only things that are triumphant--if necessary I wait until they become triumphant.",
    "Secondly, I attack only those things against which I find no allies, against which I stand alone--against which I compromise nobody but myself....",
    "Thirdly, I never make personal attacks--I use a personality merely as a magnifying-glass, by means of which I render a general, but elusive and scarcely noticeable evil, more apparent....",
    "Fourthly, I attack only those things from which all personal differences are excluded, in which any such thing as a background of disagreeable experiences is lacking.\"",
    "And now notice the gentleness with which, in Chapter II., Wagner--the supposed mortal enemy, the supposed envied rival to Nietzsche--is treated.",
    "Are these the words and the thoughts of a man who Has lost, or who is losing control?",
    "And even if we confine ourselves simply to the substance of this work and put the question--Is it a new Nietzsche or the old Nietzsche that we find in these pages?",
    "Is it the old countenance with which we are familiar, or are the features distorted, awry, disfigured?",
    "What will the answer be?",
    "Obviously there is no new or even deformed Nietzsche here, because he is still faithful to the position which he assumed in _Thus spake Zarathustra,_ five years previously, and is perfectly conscious of this fidelity (see p. 141); neither can he be even on the verge of any marked change, because the whole of the third chapter, in which he reviews his life-work, is simply a reiteration and a confirmation of his old points of view, which are here made all the more telling by additional arguments suggested, no doubt, by maturer thought.",
    "In fact, if anything at all is new in this work, it is its cool certainty, its severe deliberateness, and its extraordinarily incisive vision, as shown, for instance, in the summing up of the genuine import of the third and fourth essays in the _Thoughts out of Season_ (pp. 75-76, 80, 81, 82), a summing up which a most critical analysis of the essays in question can but verify.",
    "Romanticism, idealism, Christianity, are still scorned and despised; another outlook, a nobler, braver, and more earthly outlook, is still upheld and revered; the great yea to life, including all that it contains that is terrible and questionable, is still pronounced in the teeth of pessimists, nihilists, anarchists, Christians, and other decadents; and Germany, \"Europe's flatland,\" is still subjected to the most relentless criticism.",
    "If there are any signs of change, besides those of mere growth, in this work, they certainly succeed in eluding the most careful search, undertaken with a full knowledge of Nietzsche's former opinions, and it would be interesting to know precisely where they are found by those writers whom the titles of the chapters, alone, seem so radically to have perturbed.",
    "But the most striking thing of all, the miracle, so to speak, of this autobiography, is the absence from it of that loathing, that suggestion of surfeit, with which a life such as the one Nietzsche had led, would have filled any other man even of power approximate to his own.",
    "This anchorite, who, in the last years of his life as a healthy human being, suffered the experience of seeing even his oldest friends, including Rhode, show the most complete indifference to his lot, this wrestler with Fate, for whom recognition, in the persons of Brandes, Taine, and Strindberg, had come all too late, and whom even support, sympathy, and help, arriving as it did at last, through Deussen and from Madame de Salis Marschlins, could no longer cheer or comfort,--this was the man who was able notwithstanding to inscribe the device _amor fati_ upon his shield on the very eve of his final collapse as a victim of the unspeakable suffering he had endured.",
    "And this final collapse might easily have been foreseen.",
    "Nietzsche's sensorium, as his autobiography proves, was probably the most delicate instrument ever possessed by a human being; and with this fragile structure--the prerequisite, by the bye, of all genius,--his terrible will compelled him to confront the most profound and most recondite problems.",
    "We happen to know from another artist and profound thinker, Benjamin Disraeli, who himself had experienced a dangerous breakdown, what the consequences precisely are of indulging in excessive activity in the sphere of the spirit, more particularly when that spirit is highly organised.",
    "Disraeli says in _Contarini Fleming_",
    "(Part iv.",
    "chap.",
    "v.):-- \"I have sometimes half believed, although the suspicion is mortifying, that there is only one step between his state who deeply indulges in imaginative meditation, and insanity; for I well remember that at this period of my life, when I indulged in meditation to a degree that would now be impossible, and I hope unnecessary, my senses sometimes appeared to be wandering.\"",
    "And artists are the proper judges of artists,--not Oxford Dons, like Dr. Schiller, who, in his imprudent attempt at dealing with something for which his pragmatic hands are not sufficiently delicate, eagerly av-ails himself of popular help in his article on Nietzsche in the eleventh edition of the _Encyclopedia Britannica,_ and implies the hackneyed and wholly exploded belief that Nietzsche's philosophy is madness in the making.",
    "As German philosophies, however, are said to go to Oxford only when they die, we may, perhaps, conclude from this want of appreciation in that quarter, how very much alive Nietzsche's doctrine still is.",
    "Not that Nietzsche went mad so soon, but that he went mad so late is the wonder of wonders.",
    "Considering the extraordinary amount of work he did, the great task of the transvaluation of all values, which he actually accomplished, and the fact that he endured such long years of solitude, which to him, the sensitive artist to whom friends were everything, must have been a terrible hardship, we can only wonder at his great health, and can well believe his sister's account of the phenomenal longevity and bodily vigour of his ancestors.",
    "No one, however, who is initiated, no one who reads this work with understanding, will be in need of this introductory note of mine; for, to all who know, these pages must speak for themselves.",
    "We are no longer in the nineteenth century.",
    "We have learned many things since then, and if caution is only one of these things, at least it will prevent us from judging a book such as this one, with all its apparent pontifical pride and surging self-reliance, with undue haste, or with that arrogant assurance with which the ignorance of \"the humble\" and \"the modest\" has always confronted everything truly great.",
    "ANTHONY M. LUDOVICI.",
    "PREFACE 1",
    "As it is my intention within a very short time to confront my fellow-men with the very greatest demand that has ever yet been made upon them, it seems to me _above_ all necessary to declare here who and what I am.",
    "As a matter of fact, this ought to be pretty well known already, for I have not \"held my tongue\" about myself.",
    "But the disparity which obtains between the greatness of my task and the smallness of my contemporaries, is revealed by the fact that people have neither heard me nor yet seen me.",
    "I live on my own self-made credit, and it is probably only a prejudice to suppose that I am alive at all.",
    "I do but require to speak to any one of the scholars who come to the Ober-Engadine in the summer in order to convince myself that I am _not_ alive....",
    "Under these circumstances, it is a duty--and one against which my customary reserve, and to a still greater degree the pride of my instincts, rebel--to say: _Listen!",
    "for I am such and such a person.",
    "For Heaven's sake do not confound me with any one else!_ 2",
    "I am, for instance, in no wise a bogey man, or moral monster.",
    "On the contrary, I am the very opposite in nature to the kind of man that has been honoured hitherto as virtuous.",
    "Between ourselves, it seems to me that this is precisely a matter on which I may feel proud.",
    "I am a disciple of the philosopher Dionysus, and I would prefer to be even a satyr than a saint.",
    "But just read this book!",
    "Maybe I have here succeeded in expressing this contrast in a cheerful and at the same time sympathetic manner--maybe this is the only purpose of the present work.",
    "The very last thing I should promise to accomplish would be to \"improve\" mankind.",
    "I do not set up any new idols; may old idols only learn what it costs to have legs of clay.",
    "To overthrow idols (idols is the name I give to all ideals) is much more like my business.",
    "In proportion as an ideal world has been falsely assumed, reality has been robbed of its value, its meaning, and its truthfulness....",
    "The \"true world\" and the \"apparent world\"--in plain English, the fictitious world and reality....",
    "Hitherto the _lie_ of the ideal has been the curse of reality; by means of it the very source of mankind's instincts has become mendacious and false; so much so that those values have come to be worshipped which are the exact _opposite_ of the ones which would ensure man's prosperity, his future, and his great right to a future.",
    "3",
    "He who knows how to breathe in the air of my writings is conscious that it is the air of the heights, that it is bracing.",
    "A man must be built for it, otherwise the chances are that it will chill him.",
    "The ice is near, the loneliness is terrible--but how serenely everything lies in the sunshine!",
    "how freely one can breathe!",
    "how much, one feels, lies beneath one!",
    "Philosophy, as I have understood it hitherto, is a voluntary retirement into regions of ice and mountain-peaks--the seeking--out of everything strange and questionable in existence, everything upon which, hitherto, morality has set its ban.",
    "Through long experience, derived from such wanderings in forbidden country, I acquired an opinion very different from that which may seem generally desirable, of the causes which hitherto have led to men's moralising and idealising.",
    "The secret history of philosophers, the psychology of their great names, was revealed to me.",
    "How much truth can a certain mind endure; how much truth can it dare?--these questions became for me ever more and more the actual test of values.",
    "Error (the belief in the ideal) is not blindness; error is cowardice....",
    "Every conquest, every step forward in knowledge, is the outcome of courage, of hardness towards one's self, of cleanliness towards one's self.",
    "I do not refute ideals; all I do is to draw on my gloves in their presence.... _",

    "In my lifework, my _Zarathustra_ holds a place apart.",
    "With it, I gave my fellow-men the greatest gift that has ever been bestowed upon them.",
    "This book, the voice of which speaks out across the ages, is not only the loftiest book on earth, literally the book of mountain air,--the whole phenomenon, mankind, lies at an incalculable distance beneath it,--but",
    "it is also the deepest book, born of the inmost abundance of truth; an inexhaustible well, into which no pitcher can be lowered without coming up again laden with gold and with goodness.",
    "Here it is not a \"prophet\" who speaks, one of those gruesome hybrids of sickness and Will to Power, whom men call founders of religions.",
    "If a man would not do a sad wrong to his wisdom, he must, above all give proper heed to the tones--the halcyonic tones--that fall from the lips of Zarathustra:-- \"The most silent words are harbingers of the storm; thoughts that come on dove's feet lead the world.",
    "\"The figs fall from the trees; they are good and sweet, and, when they fall, their red skins are rent.",
    "\"A north wind am I unto ripe figs.",
    "\"Thus, like figs, do these precepts drop down to you, my friends; now drink their juice and their sweet pulp.",
    "\"It is autumn all around, and clear sky, and afternoon.\"",
    "No fanatic speaks to you here; this is not a \"sermon\"; no faith is demanded in these pages.",
    "From out an infinite treasure of light and well of joy, drop by drop, my words fall out--a slow and gentle gait is the cadence of these discourses.",
    "Such things can reach only the most elect; it is a rare privilege to be a listener here; not every one who likes can have ears to hear Zarathustra.",
    "Is not Zarathustra, because of these things, a _seducer?_ ...",
    "But what, indeed, does he himself say, when for the first time he goes back to his solitude?",
    "Just the reverse of that which any \"Sage,\" \"Saint,\" \"Saviour of the world,\" and other decadent would say....",
    "Not only his words, but he himself is other than they.",
    "\"Alone do I now go, my disciples!",
    "Get ye also hence, and alone!",

    "The happiness of my existence, its unique character perhaps, consists in its fatefulness: to speak in a riddle, as my own father I am already dead, as my own mother I still live and grow old.",
    "This double origin, taken as it were from the highest and lowest rungs of the ladder of life, at once a decadent and a beginning, this, if anything, explains that neutrality, that freedom from partisanship in regard to the general problem of existence, which perhaps distinguishes me.",
    "To the first indications of ascending or of descending life my nostrils are more sensitive than those of any man that has yet lived.",
    "In this domain I am a master to my backbone--I know both sides, for I am both sides.",
    "My father died in his six-and-thirtieth year: he was delicate, lovable, and morbid, like one who is preordained to pay simply a flying visit--a gracious reminder of life rather than life itself.",
    "In the same year that his life declined mine also declined: in my six-and-thirtieth year I reached the lowest point in my vitality,--I still lived, but my eyes could distinguish nothing that lay three paces away from me.",
    "At that time--it was the year 1879--I resigned my professorship at Bâle, lived through the summer like a shadow in St. Moritz, and spent the following winter, the most sunless of my life, like a shadow in Naumburg.",
    "This was my lowest ebb.",
    "During this period I wrote _The Wanderer and His Shadow._",
    "Without a doubt I was conversant with shadows then.",
    "The winter that followed, my first winter in Genoa, brought forth that sweetness and spirituality which is almost inseparable from extreme poverty of blood and muscle, in the shape of _The Dawn of Day,_",
    "The perfect lucidity and cheerfulness, the intellectual exuberance even, that this work reflects, coincides, in my case, not only with the most profound physiological weakness, but also with an excess of suffering.",
    "In the midst of the agony of a headache which lasted three days, accompanied by violent nausea, I was possessed of most singular dialectical clearness, and in absolutely cold blood I then thought out things, for which, in my more healthy moments, I am not enough of a climber, not sufficiently subtle, not sufficiently cold.",
    "My readers perhaps know to what extent I consider dialectic a symptom of decadence, as, for instance, in the most famous of all cases--the case of Socrates.",
    "All the morbid disturbances of the intellect, even that semi-stupor which accompanies fever, have, unto this day, remained completely unknown to me; and for my first information concerning their nature and frequency, I was obliged to have recourse to the learned works which have been compiled on the subject.",

    "Even my eye trouble, which sometimes approached so parlously near to blindness, was only an effect and not a cause; for, whenever my general vital condition improved, my power of vision also increased.",
    "Having admitted all this, do I need to say that I am experienced in questions of decadence?",
    "I know them inside and out.",
    "Even that filigree art of prehension and comprehension in general, that feeling for delicate shades of difference, that psychology of \"seeing through brick walls,\" and whatever else I may be able to do, was first learnt then, and is the specific gift of that period during which everything in me was subtilised,--observation itself, together with all the organs of observation.",
    "To look upon healthier concepts and values from the standpoint of the sick, and conversely to look down upon the secret work of the instincts of decadence from the standpoint of him who is laden and self-reliant with the richness of life--this has been my longest exercise, my principal experience.",
    "If in anything at all, it was in this that I became a master.",
    "To-day my hand knows the trick, I now have the knack of reversing perspectives: the first reason perhaps why a _Transvaluation of all Values_ has been possible to me alone.",
    "2",
    "For, apart from the fact that I am a decadent, I am also the reverse of such a creature.",
    "Among other things my proof of this is, that I always instinctively select the proper remedy when my spiritual or bodily health is low; whereas the decadent, as such, invariably chooses those remedies which are bad for him.",
    "As a whole I was sound, but in certain details I was a decadent.",
    "That energy with which I sentenced myself to absolute solitude, and to a severance from all those conditions in life to which I had grown accustomed; my discipline of myself, and my refusal to allow myself to be pampered, to be tended hand and foot, and to be doctored--all this betrays the absolute certainty of my instincts respecting what at that time was most needful to me.",
    "I placed myself in my own hands, I restored myself to health: the first condition of success in such an undertaking, as every physiologist will admit, is that at bottom a man should be sound.",
    "An intrinsically morbid nature cannot become healthy.",
    "On the other hand, to an intrinsically sound nature, illness may even constitute a powerful stimulus to life, to a surplus of life.",
    "It is in this light that I now regard the long period of illness that I endured: it seemed as if I had discovered life afresh, my own self included.",
    "I tasted all good things and even trifles in a way in which it was not easy for others to taste them--out of my Will to Health and to Life I made my philosophy....",
    "For this should be thoroughly understood; it was during those years in which my vitality reached its lowest point that I ceased from being a pessimist: the instinct of self-recovery forbade my holding to a philosophy of poverty and desperation.",
    "Now, by what signs are Nature's lucky strokes recognised among men?",
    "They are recognised by the fact that any such lucky stroke gladdens our senses; that he is carved from one integral block, which is hard, sweet, and fragrant as well.",
    "He enjoys that only which is good for him; his pleasure, his desire, ceases when the limits of that which is good for him are overstepped.",
    "He divines remedies for injuries; he knows how to turn serious accidents to his own advantage; that which does not kill him makes him stronger.",
    "He instinctively gathers his material from all he sees, hears, and experiences.",
    "He is a selective principle; he rejects much.",
    "He is always in his own company, whether his intercourse be with books, with men, or with natural scenery; he honours the things he chooses, the things he acknowledges, the things he trusts.",
    "He reacts slowly to all kinds of stimuli, with that tardiness which long caution and deliberate pride have bred in him--he tests the approaching stimulus; he would not dream of meeting it half-way.",
    "He believes neither in \"ill-luck\" nor \"guilt\"; he can digest himself and others; he knows how to forget--he is strong enough to make everything turn to his own advantage.",
    "Lo then!",
    "I am the very reverse of a decadent, for he whom I have just described is none other than myself.",
    "3",
    "This double thread of experiences, this means of access to two worlds that seem so far asunder, finds in every detail its counterpart in my own nature--I am my own complement: I have a \"second\" sight, as well as a first.",
    "And perhaps I also have a third sight.",
    "By the very nature of my origin I was allowed an outlook beyond all merely local, merely national and limited horizons; it required no effort on my part to be a \"good European.\"",
    "On the other hand, I am perhaps more German than modern Germans--mere Imperial Germans--can hope to be,--I, the last anti-political German.",
    "Be this as it may, my ancestors were Polish noblemen: it is owing to them that I have so much race instinct in my blood--who knows?",
    "perhaps even the _liberum veto_[1]",
    "When I think of the number of times in my travels that I have been accosted as a Pole, even by Poles themselves, and how seldom I have been taken for a German, it seems to me as if I belonged to those only who have a sprinkling of German in them.",
    "But my mother, Franziska Oehler, is at any rate something very German; as is also my paternal grandmother, Erdmuthe Krause.",
    "The latter spent the whole of her youth in good old Weimar, not without coming into contact with Goethe's circle.",
    "Her brother, Krause, the Professor of Theology in Königsberg, was called to the post of General Superintendent at Weimar after Herder's death.",
    "It is not unlikely that her mother, my great grandmother, is mentioned in young Goethe's diary under the name of \"Muthgen.\"",
    "She married twice, and her second husband was Superintendent Nietzsche of Eilenburg.",
    "In 1813, the year of the great war, when Napoleon with his general staff entered Eilenburg on the 10th of October, she gave birth to a son.",
    "As a daughter of Saxony she was a great admirer of Napoleon, and maybe I am so still.",
    "My father, born in 1813, died in 1849.",
    "Previous to taking over the pastorship of the parish of Röcken, not far from Lützen, he lived for some years at the Castle of Altenburg, where he had charge of the education of the four princesses.",
    "His pupils are the Queen of Hanover, the Grand-Duchess Constantine, the Grand-Duchess of Oldenburg, and the Princess Theresa of Saxe-Altenburg.",
    "He was full of loyal respect for the Prussian King, Frederick William the Fourth, from whom he obtained his living at Röcken; the events of 1848 saddened him extremely.",
    "As I was born on the 15 th of October, the birthday of the king above mentioned, I naturally received the Hohenzollern names of Frederick William.",
    "There was at all events one advantage in the choice of this day: my birthday throughout the whole of my childhood was a day of public rejoicing.",
    "I regard it as a great privilege to have had such a father: it even seems to me that this embraces all that I can claim in the matter of privileges--life, the great yea to life, excepted.",
    "What I owe to him above all is this, that I do not need any special intention, but merely a little patience, in order involuntarily to enter a world of higher and more delicate things.",
    "There I am at home, there alone does my inmost passion become free.",
    "The fact that I had to pay for this privilege almost with my life, certainly does not make it a bad bargain.",
    "In order to understand even a little of _my Zarathustra,_ perhaps a man must be situated and constituted very much as I am myself--with one foot beyond the realm of the living.",
    "4",
    "I have never understood the art of arousing ill-feeling against myself,--this is also something for which I have to thank my incomparable father,--even when it seemed to me highly desirable to do so.",
    "However un-Christian it may seem, I do not even bear any ill-feeling towards myself.",
    "Turn my life about as you may, you will find but seldom--perhaps indeed only once--any trace of some one's having shown me ill-will.",
    "You might perhaps discover, however, too many traces of _goodwill...._",
    "My experiences even with those on whom every other man has burnt his fingers, speak without exception in their favour; I tame every bear, I can make even clowns behave decently.",
    "During the seven years in which I taught Greek to the sixth form of the College at Bâle, I never had occasion to administer a punishment; the laziest youths were diligent in my class.",
    "The unexpected has always found me equal to it; I must be unprepared in order to keep my self-command.",
    "Whatever the instrument was, even if it were as out of tune as the instrument \"man\" can possibly be,--it was only when I was ill that I could not succeed in making it express something that was worth hearing.",
    "And how often have I not been told by the \"instruments\" themselves, that they had never before heard their voices express such beautiful things....",
    "This was said to me most delightfully perhaps by that young fellow Heinrich von Stein, who died at such an unpardonably early age, and who, after having considerately asked leave to do so, once appeared in Sils-Maria for a three days' sojourn, telling everybody there that it was _not_ for the Engadine that he had come.",
    "This excellent person, who with all the impetuous simplicity of a young Prussian nobleman, had waded deep into the swamp of Wagnerism (and into that of Dübringism[2] into the bargain!), seemed almost transformed during these three days by a hurricane of freedom, like one who has been suddenly raised to his full height and given wings.",
    "Again and again I said to him that this was all owing to the splendid air; everybody felt the same,--one could not stand 6000 feet above Bayreuth for nothing,--but he would not believe me....",
    "Be this as it may, if I have been the victim of many a small or even great offence, it was not \"will,\" and least of all ill-will that actuated the offenders; but rather, as I have already suggested, it was goodwill, the cause of no small amount of mischief in f",
    "my life, about which I had to complain.",
    "_",
    "My_ experience gave me a right to feel suspicious in regard to all so-called \"unselfish\" instincts, in regard to the whole of \"neighbourly love\" which is ever ready and waiting with deeds or with advice.",
    "To me it seems that these instincts are a sign of weakness, they are an example of the inability to withstand a stimulus--it is only among decadents that this _",
    "pity_ is called a virtue.",
    "What I reproach the pitiful with is, that they are too ready to forget shame, reverence, and the delicacy of feeling which knows how to keep at a distance; they do not remember that this gushing pity stinks of the mob, and that it is next of kin to bad manners--that pitiful hands may be thrust with results fatally destructive into a great destiny, into a lonely and wounded retirement, and into the privileges with which great guilt endows one.",
    "The overcoming of pity I reckon among the noble virtues; In the \"Temptation of Zarathustra\" I have imagined a case, in which a great cry of distress reaches his ears, in which pity swoops down upon him like a last sin, and would make him break faith with himself.",
    "To remain one's own master in such circumstances, to keep the sublimity of one's mission pure in such cases,--pure from the many ignoble and more short-sighted impulses which come into play in so-called unselfish actions,--this is the rub, the last test perhaps which a Zarathustra has to undergo--the actual proof of his power.",
    "5",
    "In yet another respect I am no more than my father over again, and as it were the continuation of his life after an all-too-early death.",
    "Like every man who has never been able to meet his equal, and unto whom the concept \"retaliation\" is just as incomprehensible as the notion of \"equal rights,\" I have forbidden myself the use of any sort of measure of security or protection--and also, of course, of defence and \"justification\"--in all cases in which I have been made the victim either of trifling or even _very great_ foolishness.",
    "My form of retaliation consists in this: as soon as possible to set a piece of cleverness at the heels of an act of stupidity; by this means perhaps it may still be possible to overtake it.",
    "To speak in a parable: I dispatch a pot of jam in order to get rid of a bitter experience....",
    "Let anybody only give me offence, I shall \"retaliate,\" he can be quite sure of that: before long I discover an opportunity of expressing my thanks to the \"offender\" (among other things even for the offence)--or of _asking_ him for something, which can be more courteous even than giving.",
    "It also seems to me that the rudest word, the rudest letter, is more good-natured, more straightforward, than silence.",
    "Those--who keep silent are almost always lacking in subtlety and refinement of heart; silence is an objection, to swallow a grievance must necessarily produce a bad temper--it even upsets the stomach.",
    "All silent people are dyspeptic.",
    "You perceive that I should not like to see rudeness undervalued; it is by far the most _humane_ form of contradiction, and, in the midst of modern effeminacy, it is one of our first virtues; If one is sufficiently rich for it, it may even be a joy to be wrong.",
    "If a god were to descend to this earth, he would have to do nothing but wrong--to take _guilt_ not punishment, on one's shoulders, is the first proof of divinity.",
    "6 Freedom from resentment and the understanding of the nature of resentment--who knows how very much after all I am indebted to my long illness for these two things?",
    "The problem is not exactly simple: a man must have experienced both through his strength and through his weakness, If illness and weakness are to be charged with anything at all, it is with the fact that when they prevail, the very instinct of recovery, which is the instinct of defence and of war in man, becomes decayed.",
    "He knows not how to get rid of anything, how to come to terms with anything, and how to cast anything behind him.",
    "Everything wounds him.",
    "People and things draw importunately near, all experiences strike deep, memory is a gathering wound.",
    "To be ill is a sort of resentment in itself.",
    "Against this resentment the invalid has only one great remedy--I call it _Russian fatalism,_ that fatalism which is free from revolt, and with which the Russian soldier, to whom a campaign proves unbearable, ultimately lays himself down in the snow.",
    "To accept nothing more, to undertake nothing more, to absorb nothing more--to cease entirely from reacting....",
    "The tremendous sagacity of this fatalism, which does not always imply merely the courage for death, but which in the most dangerous cases may actually constitute a self-preservative measure, amounts to a reduction of activity in the vital functions, the slackening down of which is like a sort of will to hibernate.",
    "A few steps farther in this direction we find the fakir, who will sleep for weeks in a tomb....",
    "Owing to the fact that one would be used up too quickly if one reacted, one no longer reacts at all: this is the principle.",
    "And nothing on earth consumes a man more quickly than the passion of resentment.",
    "Mortification, morbid susceptibility, the inability to wreak revenge, the desire and thirst for revenge, the concoction of every sort of poison--this is surely the most injurious manner of reacting which could possibly be conceived by exhausted men.",
    "It involves a rapid wasting away of nervous energy, an abnormal increase of detrimental secretions, as, for instance, that of bile into the stomach.",
    "To the sick man resentment ought to be more strictly forbidden than anything else--it is _his_ special danger: unfortunately, however, it is also his most natural propensity.",
    "This was fully grasped by that profound physiologist Buddha.",
    "His \"religion,\" which it would be better to call a system of hygiene, in order to avoid confounding it with a creed so wretched as Christianity, depended for its effect upon the triumph over resentment: to make the soul free therefrom was considered the first step towards recovery.",
    "\"Not through hostility is hostility put to flight; through friendship does hostility end\": this stands at the beginning of Buddha's teaching--this is not a precept of morality, but of physiology.",
    "Resentment born of weakness is not more deleterious to anybody than it is to the weak man himself--conversely, in the case of that man whose nature is fundamentally a rich one, resentment is a superfluous feeling, a feeling to remain master of which is almost a proof of riches.",
    "Those of my readers who know the earnestness-with which my philosophy wages war against the feelings of revenge and rancour, even to the extent of attacking the doctrine of \"free will\" (my conflict with Christianity is only a particular instance of it), will understand why I wish to focus attention upon my own personal attitude and the certainty of my practical instincts precisely in this matter.",
    "In my moments of decadence I forbade myself the indulgence of the above feelings, because they were harmful; as soon as my life recovered enough riches and pride, however, I regarded them again as forbidden, but this time because they were _beneath_ me.",
    "That \"Russian fatalism\" of which I have spoken manifested itself in me in such a way that for years I held tenaciously to almost insufferable conditions, places, habitations, and companions, once chance had placed them on my path--it was better than changing them, than feeling that they could be changed, than revolting against them....",
    "He who stirred me from this fatalism, he who violently tried to shake me into consciousness, seemed to me then a mortal enemy--in point of fact, there was danger of death each time this was done.",
    "To regard one's self as a destiny, not to wish one's self \"different\"--this, in such circumstances, is sagacity, itself.",
    "7 War, on the other hand, is something different.",
    "At heart I am a warrior.",
    "Attacking belongs to my instincts.",
    "To _be able to be_ an enemy, to _be_ an enemy--maybe these things presuppose a strong nature; in any case all strong natures involve these things.",
    "Such natures need resistance, consequently they go in search of obstacles: the pathos of aggression belongs of necessity to strength as much as the feelings of revenge and of rancour belong to weakness.",
    "Woman, for instance, is revengeful; her weakness involves this passion, just as it involves her susceptibility in the presence of other people's suffering.",
    "The strength of the aggressor can be measured by the opposition which he needs; every increase of growth betrays itself by a seeking out of more formidable opponents--or problems: for a philosopher who is combative challenges even problems to a duel.",
    "The task is not to overcome opponents in general, but only those opponents against whom one has to summon all one's strength, one's skill, and one's swordsmanship--in fact, opponents who are one's equals....",
    "To be one's enemy's equal--this is the first condition of an honourable duel.",
    "Where one despises, one cannot wage war.",
    "Where one commands, where one sees something _beneath_ one, one _ought_ not to wage war.",
    "My war tactics can be reduced to four principles A First, I attack only things that are triumphant--if necessary I wait until they become triumphant.",
    "Secondly, I attack only those things against which I find no allies, against which I stand alone--against which I compromise nobody but myself....",
    "I have not yet taken one single step before the public eye, which did not compromise me: that is _my_ criterion of a proper mode of action.",
    "Thirdly, I never make personal attacks--I use a personality merely as a magnifying-glass, by means of which I render a general, but elusive and scarcely noticeable evil, more apparent.",
    "In this way I attacked David Strauss, or rather the success given to a senile book by the cultured classes of Germany--by this means I caught German culture red-handed.",
    "In this way I attacked Wagner, or rather the falsity or mongrel instincts of our \"culture\" which confounds the super-refined with the strong, and the effete with the great.",
    "Fourthly, I attack only those things from which all personal differences are excluded, in which any such thing as a background of disagreeable experiences is lacking.",
    "On the contrary, attacking is to me a proof of goodwill and, in certain circumstances, of gratitude.",
    "By means of it, I do honour to a thing, I distinguish a thing; whether I associate my name with that of an institution or a person, by being _against_ or _for_ either, is all the same to me.",
    "If I wage war against Christianity, I feel justified in doing so, because in that quarter I have met with no fatal experiences and difficulties--the most earnest Christians have always been kindly disposed to me.",
    "I, personally, the most essential opponent of Christianity, am far from holding the individual responsible for what is the fatality of long ages.",
    "May I be allowed to hazard a suggestion concerning one last trait in my character, which in my intercourse with other men has led me into some difficulties?",
    "I am gifted with a sense of cleanliness the keenness of which is phenomenal; so much so, that I can ascertain physiologically--that is to say, smell--the proximity, nay, the inmost core, the \"entrails\" of every human soul....",
    "This sensitiveness of mine is furnished with psychological antennæ, wherewith I feel and grasp every secret: the quality of concealed filth lying at the base of many a human character which may be the inevitable outcome of base blood, and which education may have veneered, is revealed to me at the first glance.",
    "If my observation has been correct, such people, whom my sense of cleanliness rejects, also become conscious, on their part, of the cautiousness to which my loathing prompts me: and this does not make them any more fragrant....",
    "In keeping with a custom which I have long observed,--pure habits and honesty towards myself are among the first conditions of my existence, I would die in unclean surroundings,--I swim, bathe, and splash about, as it were, incessantly in water, in any kind of perfectly transparent and shining element.",
    "That is why my relations with my fellows try my patience to no small extent; my humanity does not consist in the fact that I understand the feelings of my fellows, but that I can endure to understand....",
    "My humanity is a perpetual process of self-mastery.",
    "But I need solitude--that is to say, recovery, return to myself, the breathing of free, crisp, bracing air....",
    "The whole of my _Zarathustra_ is a dithyramb in honour of solitude, or, if I have been understood, in honour of purity.",
    "Thank Heaven, it is not in honour of \"pure foolery\"![3]",
    "He who has an eye for colour will call him a diamond.",
    "The loathing of mankind, of the rabble, was always my greatest danger....",
    "Would you hearken to the words spoken by Zarathustra concerning deliverance from loathing?",
    "\"What forsooth hath come unto me?",
    "How did I deliver myself from loathing?",
    "Who hath made mine eye younger?",
    "How did I soar to the height, where there are no more rabble sitting about the well?",
    "\"Did my very loathing forge me wings and the strength to scent fountains afar off?",
    "Verily to the loftiest heights did I need to fly, to find once more the spring of joyfulness.",
    "\"Oh, I found it, my brethren!",
    "Up here, on the loftiest height, the spring of joyfulness gusheth forth for me.",
    "And there is a life at the well of which no rabble can drink with you.",

    "And ofttimes dost thou empty the pitcher again in trying to fill it.",
    "\"And yet must I learn to draw near thee more humbly.",
    "Far too eagerly doth my heart jump to meet thee.",
    "\"My heart, whereon my summer burneth, my short, hot, melancholy, over-blessed summer: how my summer heart yearneth for thy coolness!",
    "\"Farewell, the lingering affliction of my spring!",
    "Past is the wickedness of my snowflakes in June!",
    "Summer have I become entirely, and summer noontide!",
    "\"A summer in the loftiest heights, with cold springs and blessed stillness: oh come, my friends, that the stillness may wax even more blessed!",
    "\"For this is our height and our home: too high and steep is our dwelling for all the unclean and their appetites.",

    "It will laugh back at you with its purity.",
    "\"On the tree called Future do we build our nest: eagles shall bring food in their beaks unto us lonely ones!",
    "\"Verily not the food whereof the unclean might partake.",

    "\"Verily, no abodes for the unclean do we here hold in readiness!",
    "To their bodies our happiness would seem an ice-cavern, and to their spirits also!",
    "\"And like strong winds will we live above them, neighbours to the eagles, companions of the snow, and playmates of the sun: thus do strong winds live.",
    "\"And like a wind shall I one day blow amidst them, and take away their soul's breath with my spirit: thus my future willeth it.",
    "\"Verily, a strong wind is Zarathustra to all low lands; and this is his counsel to his foes and to all those who spit and spew: 'Beware of spitting against the wind!'\"",

    "Here are a few more indications as to my morality.",
    "A heavy meal is digested more easily than an inadequate one.",
    "The first principle of a good digestion is that the stomach should become active as a whole.",
    "A man ought, therefore, to know the size of his stomach.",
    "For the same reasons all those interminable meals, which I call interrupted sacrificial feasts, and which are to be had at any table d'hôte, are strongly to be deprecated.",
    "Nothing should be eaten between meals, coffee should be given up--coffee makes one gloomy.",
    "Tea is beneficial only in the morning.",
    "It should be taken in small quantities, but very strong.",
    "It may be very harmful, and indispose you for the whole day, if it be taken the least bit too weak.",
    "Everybody has his own standard in this matter, often between the narrowest and most delicate limits.",
    "In an enervating climate tea is not a good beverage with which to start the day: an hour before taking it an excellent thing is to drink a cup of thick cocoa, feed from oil.",
    "Remain seated as little as possible, put no trust in any thought that is not born in the open, to the accompaniment of free bodily motion--nor in one in which even the muscles do not celebrate a feast.",
    "All prejudices take their origin in the intestines.",
    "A sedentary life, as I have already said elsewhere, is the real sin against the Holy Spirit.",
    "2.",
    "To the question of nutrition, that of locality and climate is next of kin.",
    "Nobody is so constituted as to be able to live everywhere and anywhere; and he who has great duties to perform, which lay claim to all his strength, has, in this respect, a very limited choice.",
    "The influence of climate upon the bodily functions, affecting their acceleration or retardation, extends so far, that a blunder in the choice of locality and climate is able not only to alienate a man from his actual duty, but also to withhold it from him altogether, so that he never even comes face to face with it.",
    "Animal vigour never acquires enough strength in him in order to reach that pitch of artistic freedom which makes his own soul whisper to him: I, alone, can do that....",
    "Ever so slight a tendency to laziness in the intestines, once it has become a habit, is quite sufficient to make something mediocre, something \"German\" out of a genius; the climate of Germany, alone, is enough to discourage the strongest and most heroically disposed intestines.",
    "The tempo of the body's functions is closely bound up with the agility or the clumsiness of the spirit's feet; spirit itself is indeed only a form of these organic functions.",
    "Let anybody make a list of the places in which men of great intellect have been found, and are still found; where wit, subtlety, and malice constitute happiness; where genius is almost necessarily at home: all of them rejoice in exceptionally dry air.",
    "Paris, Provence, Florence, Jerusalem, Athens--these names prove something, namely: that genius is conditioned by dry air, by a pure sky--that is to say, by rapid organic functions, by the constant and ever-present possibility of procuring for one's self great and even enormous quantities of strength.",
    "I have a certain case in mind in which a man of remarkable intellect and independent spirit became a narrow, craven specialist and a grumpy old crank, simply owing to a lack of subtlety in his instinct for climate.",
    "And I myself might have been an example of the same thing, if illness had not compelled me to reason, and to reflect upon reason realistically.",
    "Now that I have learnt through long practice to read the effects of climatic and meteorological influences, from my own body, as though from a very delicate and reliable instrument, and that I am able to calculate the change in degrees of atmospheric moisture by means of physiological observations upon myself, even on so short a journey as that from Turin to Milan; I think with horror of the ghastly fact that my whole life, until the last ten years,--the most perilous years,--has always been spent in the wrong, and what to me ought to have been the most forbidden, places.",
    "Naumburg, Pforta, Thuringia in general, Leipzig, Bâle, Venice--so many ill-starred places for a constitution like mine.",
    "If I cannot recall one single happy reminiscence of my childhood and youth, it is nonsense to suppose that so-called \"moral\" causes could account for this--as, for instance, the incontestable fact that I lacked companions that could have satisfied me; for this fact is the same to-day as it ever was, and it does not prevent me from being cheerful and brave.",
    "But it was ignorance in physiological matters--that confounded \"Idealism\"--that was the real curse of my life.",
    "This was the superfluous and foolish element in my existence; something from which nothing could spring, and for which there can be no settlement and no compensation.",
    "As the outcome of this \"Idealism\" I regard all the blunders, the great aberrations of instinct, and the \"modest specialisations\" which drew me aside from the task of my life; as, for instance, the fact that I became a philologist--why not at least a medical man or anything else which might have opened my eyes?",
    "My days at Bâle, the whole of my intellectual routine, including my daily time-table, was an absolutely senseless abuse of extraordinary powers, without the slightest compensation for the strength that I spent, without even a thought of what I was squandering and how its place might be filled.",
    "I lacked all subtlety in egoism, all the fostering care of an imperative instinct; I was in a state in which one is ready to regard one's self as anybody's equal, a state of \"disinterestedness,\" a forgetting of one's distance from others--something, in short, for which I can never forgive myself.",
    "When I had well-nigh reached the end of my tether, simply because I had almost reached my end, I began to reflect upon the fundamental absurdity of my life--\"Idealism.\"",
    "It was _illness_ that first brought me to reason.",

    "As far as I in particular am concerned, _reading_ in general belongs to my means of recuperation; consequently it belongs to that which rids me of myself, to that which enables me to wander in strange sciences and strange souls--to that, in fact, about which I am no longer in earnest.",
    "Indeed, it is while reading that I recover from _my_ earnestness.",
    "During the time that I am deeply absorbed in my work, no books are found within my reach; it would never occur to me to allow any one to speak or even to think in my presence.",
    "For that is what reading would mean....",
    "Has any one ever actually noticed, that, during the period of profound tension to which the state of pregnancy condemns not only the mind, but also, at bottom, the whole organism, accident and every kind of external stimulus acts too acutely and strikes too deep?",
    "Accident and external stimuli must, as far as possible, be avoided: a sort of walling-of-one's-self-in is one of the primary instinctive precautions of spiritual pregnancy.",

    "An excellent study by Victor Brochard upon the Greek sceptics, in which my Laertiana[1] was used to advantage.",
    "The sceptics!--the only _honourable_ types among that double-faced and sometimes quintuple-faced throng, the philosophers!....",
    "Otherwise I almost always take refuge in the same books: altogether their number is small; they are books which are precisely my proper fare.",
    "It is not perhaps in my nature to read much, and of all sorts: a library makes me ill.",
    "Neither is it my nature to love much or many kinds of things.",
    "Suspicion or even hostility towards new books is much more akin to my instinctive feeling than \"toleration,\" _largeur de cœur,_ and other forms of \"neighbour-love.\"",

    "The most striking example of this was Madame Cosima Wagner, by far the most decisive voice in matters of taste that I have ever heard.",

    "as the most instinctive sacrifice to Christianity, killing himself inch by inch, first bodily, then spiritually, according to the terrible consistency of this most appalling form of inhuman cruelty; if I have something of Montaigne's mischievousness in my soul, and--who knows?--perhaps also in my body; if my artist's taste endeavours to defend the names of Molière, Corneille, and Racine, and not without bitterness, against such a wild genius as Shakespeare--all this does not prevent me from regarding even the latter-day Frenchmen also as charming companions.",

    "He is quite priceless, with his psychologist's eye, quick at forestalling and anticipating; with his grasp of facts, which is reminiscent of the same art in the greatest of all masters of facts (_ex ungue Napoleonem_); and, last but not least, as an honest atheist--a specimen which is both rare and difficult to discover in France--all honour to Prosper Mérimée!...",

    "The Germans are _incapable_ of conceiving anything sublime: for a proof of this, look at Schumann!",
    "Out of anger for this mawkish Saxon, I once deliberately composed a counter-overture to _Manfred,_ of which Hans von Bülow declared he had never seen the like before on paper: such compositions amounted to a violation of Euterpe.",

    "With a nature like mine, which is so strange to everything Teutonic, that even the presence of a German retards my digestion, my first meeting with Wagner was the first moment in my life in which I breathed freely: I felt him, I honoured him, as a foreigner, as the opposite and the incarnate contradiction of all \"German virtues.\"",

    "All the quaint features of Leonardo da Vinci's work lose their charm at the sound of the first bar in _Tristan._",
    "This work is without question Wagner's _non plus ultra_; after its creation, the composition of the _Mastersingers_ and of the _Ring_ was a relaxation to him.",
    "To become more healthy--this in a nature like Wagner's amounts to going backwards.",
    "The curiosity of the psychologist is so great in me, that I regard it as quite a special privilege to have lived at the right time, and to have lived precisely among Germans, in order to be ripe for this work.",
    "The world must indeed be empty for him who has never been unhealthy enough for this \"infernal voluptuousness\": it is allowable, it is even imperative, to employ a mystic formula for this purpose.",
    "I suppose I know better than any one the prodigious feats of which Wagner was capable, the fifty worlds of strange ecstasies to which no one else had wings to soar; and as I am alive to-day and strong enough to turn even the most suspicious and most dangerous things to my own advantage, and thus to grow stronger, I declare Wagner to have been the greatest benefactor of my life.",
    "The bond which unites us is the fact that we have suffered greater agony, even at each other's hands, than most men are able to bear nowadays, and this will always keep our names associated in the minds of men.",

    "I shall never admit that a German _can_ understand what music is.",
    "Those musicians who are called German, the greatest and most famous foremost, are all foreigners, either Slavs, Croats, Italians, Dutchmen--or Jews; or else, like Heinrich Schütz, Bach, and Händel, they are Germans of a strong race which is now extinct.",
    "For my own part, I have still enough of the Pole left in me to let all other music go, if only I can keep Chopin.",
    "For three reasons I would except Wagner's _Siegfried Idyll,_ and perhaps also one or two things of Liszt, who excelled all other musicians in the noble tone of his orchestration; and finally everything that has been produced beyond the Alps_--this side_ of the Alps.[3] I could not possibly dispense with Rossini, and still less with my Southern soul in music, the work of my Venetian maestro, Pietro Gasti.",

    "To close one's eyes to much, to seal one's ears to much, to keep certain things at a distance--this is the first principle of prudence, the first proof of the fact that a man is not an accident but a necessity.",
    "The popular word for this instinct of defence is _taste._",
    "A man's imperative command is not only to say \"no\" in cases where \"yes\" would be a sign of \"disinterestedness,\" but also to say \"no\" _as seldom as possible._",
    "One must part with all that which compels one to repeat \"no,\" with ever greater frequency.",
    "The rationale of this principle is that all discharges of defensive forces, however slight they may be, involve enormous and absolutely superfluous losses when they become regular and habitual.",
    "Our greatest expenditure of strength is made up of those small and most frequent discharges of it.",
    "The act of keeping things off, of holding them at a distance, amounts to a discharge of strength,--do not deceive yourselves on this point!--and an expenditure of energy directed at purely negative ends.",
    "Simply by being compelled to keep constantly on his guard, a man may grow so weak as to be unable any longer to defend himself.",
    "Suppose I were to step out of my house, and, instead of the quiet and aristocratic city of Turin, I were to find a German provincial town, my instinct would have to brace itself together in order to repel all that which would pour in upon it from this crushed-down and cowardly world.",

    "Another form of prudence and self-defence consists in trying to react as seldom as possible, and to keep one's self aloof from those circumstances and conditions wherein one would be condemned, as it were, to suspend one's \"liberty\" and one's initiative, and become a mere reacting medium.",
    "As an example of this I point to the intercourse with books.",
    "The scholar who, in sooth, does little else than handle books--with the philologist of average attainments their number may amount to two hundred a day--ultimately forgets entirely and completely the capacity of thinking for himself.",
    "When he has not a book between his fingers he cannot think.",
    "When he thinks, he responds to a stimulus (a thought he has read),--finally all he does is to react.",
    "The scholar exhausts his whole strength in saying either \"yes\" or \"no\" to matter which has already been thought out, or in criticising it--he is no longer capable of thought on his own account....",
    "In him the instinct of self-defence has decayed, otherwise he would defend himself against books.",
    "The scholar is a decadent.",

    "Granting that one's life-task--the determination and the fate of one's life-task--greatly exceeds the average measure of such things, nothing more dangerous could be conceived than to come face to face with one's self by the side of this life-task.",
    "The fact that one becomes what one is, presupposes that one has not the remotest suspicion of what one is.",
    "From this standpoint even the blunders of one's life have their own meaning and value, the temporary deviations and aberrations, the moments of hesitation and of modesty, the earnestness wasted upon duties which lie outside the actual life-task.",
    "In these matters great wisdom, perhaps even the highest wisdom, comes into activity: in these circumstances, in which _nosce teipsum_ would be the sure road to ruin, forgetting one's self, misunderstanding one's self, belittling one's self, narrowing one's self, and making one's self mediocre, amount to reason itself.",
    "Expressed morally, to love one's neighbour and to live for others and for other things _may_ be the means of protection employed to maintain the hardest kind of egoism.",
    "This is the exceptional case in which I, contrary to my principle and conviction, take the side of the altruistic instincts; for here they are concerned in subserving selfishness and self-discipline.",
    "The whole surface of consciousness--for consciousness _is_ a surface--must be kept free from any one of the great imperatives.",
    "Beware even of every striking word, of every striking attitude!",
    "They are all so many risks which the instinct runs of \"understanding itself\" too soon.",
    "Meanwhile the organising \"idea,\" which is destined to become master, grows and continues to grow into the depths,--it begins to command, it leads you slowly back from your deviations and aberrations, it prepares individual qualities and capacities, which one day will make themselves felt as indispensable to the whole of your task,--step by step it cultivates all the serviceable faculties, before it ever whispers a word concerning the dominant task, the \"goal,\" the \"object,\" and the \"meaning\" of it all.",
    "Looked at from this standpoint my life is simply amazing.",
    "For the task of _transvaluing values,_ more capacities were needful perhaps than could well be found side by side in one individual; and above all, antagonistic capacities which had to be free from the mutual strife and destruction which they involve.",
    "An order of rank among capacities; distance; the art of separating without creating hostility; to refrain from confounding things; to keep from reconciling things; to possess enormous multifariousness and yet to be the reverse of chaos--all this was the first condition, the long secret work, and the artistic mastery of my instinct.",
    "Its superior guardianship manifested itself with such exceeding strength, that not once did I ever dream of what was growing within me--until suddenly all my capacities were ripe, and one day burst forth in all the perfection of their highest bloom.",
    "I cannot remember ever having exerted myself, I can point to no trace of _struggle_ in my life; I am the reverse of a heroic nature.",
    "To \"will\" something, to \"strive\" after something, to have an \"aim\" or a \"desire\" in my mind--I know none of these things from experience.",

    "I have not the slightest wish that anything should be otherwise than it is: I myself would not be otherwise....",

    "I have never had a desire.",
    "A man who, after his four-and-fortieth year, can say that he has never bothered himself about _honours, women,_ or _money_!--not that they did not come his way....",
    "It was thus that I became one day a University Professor--I had never had the remotest idea of such a thing; for I was scarcely four-and-twenty years of age.",
    "In the same way, two years previously, I had one day become a philologist, in the sense that my _first_ philological work, my start in every way, was expressly obtained by my master Ritschl for publication in his _",

    "In saying this I do not mean to underestimate in any way my Thuringian brother, the intelligent Leopold von Ranke....)",

    "For, after all, I was this marine animal: almost every sentence in the book was thought out, or rather _caught,_ among that medley of rocks in the neighbourhood of Genoa, where I lived quite alone, and exchanged secrets with the ocean.",
    "Even to this day, when by chance I happen to turn over the leaves of this book, almost every sentence seems to me like a hook by means of which I draw something incomparable out of the depths; its whole skin quivers with delicate shudders of recollection.",
    "This book is conspicuous for no little art in gently catching things which whisk rapidly and silently away, moments which I call godlike lizards--not with the cruelty of that young Greek god who simply transfixed the poor little beast; but nevertheless with something pointed--with a pen.",

    "My life-task is to prepare for humanity one supreme moment in which it can come to its senses, a Great Noon in which it will turn its gaze backwards and forwards, in which it will step from under the yoke of accident and of priests, and for the first time set the question of the Why and Wherefore of humanity as a whole--this life-task naturally follows out of the conviction that mankind does _not_ get on the right road of its own accord, that it is by no means divinely ruled, but rather that it is precisely under the cover of its most holy valuations that the instinct of negation, of corruption, and of degeneration has held such a seductive sway.",
    "The question concerning the origin of moral valuations is therefore a matter of the highest importance to me because it determines the future of mankind.",
    "The demand made upon us to believe that everything is really in the best hands, that a certain book, the Bible, gives us the definite and comforting assurance that there is a Providence that wisely rules the fate of man,--when translated back into reality amounts simply to this, namely, the will to stifle the truth which maintains the reverse of all this, which is that hitherto man has been in the _worst possible_ hands, and that he has been governed by the physiologically botched, the men of cunning and burning revengefulness, and the so-called \"saints\"--those slanderers of the world and traducers of humanity.",
    "The definite proof of the fact that the priest (including the priest in disguise, the philosopher) has become master, not only within a certain limited religious community, but everywhere, and that the morality of decadence, the will to nonentity, has become morality _per se,_ is to be found in this: that altruism is now an absolute value, and egoism is regarded with hostility everywhere.",
    "He who disagrees with me on this point, I regard as infected.",

    "To a physiologist a like antagonism between values admits of no doubt.",
    "If the most insignificant organ within the body neglects, however slightly, to assert with absolute certainty its self-preservative powers, its recuperative claims, and its egoism, the whole system degenerates.",
    "The physiologist insists upon the removal of degenerated parts, he denies all fellow-feeling for such parts, and has not the smallest feeling of pity for them.",
    "But the desire of the priest is precisely the degeneration of the whole of mankind; hence his preservation of that which is degenerate--this is what his dominion costs humanity.",
    "What meaning have those lying concepts, those handmaids of morality, \"Soul,\" \"Spirit,\" \"Free will,\" \"God,\" if their aim is not the physiological ruin of mankind?",
    "When earnestness is diverted from the instincts that aim at self-preservation and an increase of bodily energy, _i.e._ at an _increase of life_; when anæmia is raised to an ideal and the contempt of the body is construed as \"the salvation of the soul,\" what is all this if it is not a recipe for decadence?",

    "The songs of Prince Free-as-a-Bird, which, for the most part, were written in Sicily, remind me quite forcibly of that Provencal notion of \"_Gaya Scienza,_\" of that union of _singer, knight, and free spirit,_ which distinguishes that wonderfully early culture of the Provencals from all ambiguous cultures.",

    "The fundamental idea of the work, the _Eternal Recurrence,_ the highest formula of a Yea-saying to life that can ever be attained, was first conceived in the month of August 1881.",
    "I made a note of the idea on a sheet of paper, with the postscript: \"Six thousand feet beyond man and time.\"",
    "That day I happened to be wandering through the woods alongside of the Lake of Silvaplana, and I halted not far from Surlei, beside a huge rock that towered aloft like a pyramid.",
    "It was then that the thought struck me.",
    "Looking back now, I find that exactly two months before this inspiration I had an omen of its coming in the form of a sudden and decisive change in my tastes--more particularly in music.",
    "The whole of _Zarathustra_ might perhaps be classified under the rubric music.",
    "At all events, the essential condition of its production was a second birth within me of the art of hearing.",
    "In Recoaro, a small mountain resort near Vicenza, where I spent the spring of 1881, I and my friend and maestro, Peter Gast--who was also one who had been born again, discovered that the phœnix music hovered over us, in lighter and brighter plumage than it had ever worn before.",
    "If, therefore, I now calculate from that day forward the sudden production of the book, under the most unlikely circumstances, in February 1883,--the last part, out of which I quoted a few lines in my preface, was written precisely in the hallowed hour when Richard Wagner gave up the ghost in Venice,--I come to the conclusion that the period of gestation covered eighteen months.",
    "This period of exactly eighteen months, might suggest, at least to Buddhists, that I am in reality a female elephant The interval was devoted to the _Gaya Scienza,_ which contains hundreds of indications of the proximity of something unparalleled; for, after all, it shows the beginning of _Zarathustra,_ since it presents _",
    "Zarathustra's_ fundamental thought in the last aphorism but one of the fourth book.",
    "To this interval also belongs that _Hymn to Life_ (for a mixed choir and orchestra), the score of which was published in Leipzig two years ago by E. W. Fritsch, and which gave perhaps no slight indication of my spiritual state during this year, in which the essentially yea-saying pathos, which I call the tragic pathos, completely filled me heart and limb.",
    "One day people will sing it to my memory.",
    "The text, let it be well understood, as there is some misunderstanding abroad on this point, is not by me; it was the astounding inspiration of a young Russian lady, Miss Lou von Salome, with whom I was then on friendly terms.",

    "During the following winter, I was living on that charmingly peaceful Gulf of Rapallo, not far from Genoa, which cuts inland between Chiavari and Cape Porto Fino.",
    "My health was not very good; the winter was cold and exceptionally rainy; and the small _albergo_ in which I lived was so close to the water that at night my sleep was disturbed if the sea was rough.",
    "These circumstances were surely the very reverse of favourable; and yet, in spite of it all, and as if in proof of my belief that everything decisive comes to life in defiance of every obstacle, it was precisely during this winter and in the midst of these unfavourable circumstances that my _Zarathustra_ originated.",
    "In the morning I used to start out in a southerly direction up the glorious road to Zoagli, which rises up through a forest of pines and gives one a view far out to sea.",
    "In the afternoon, or as often as my health allowed, I walked round the whole bay from Santa Margherita to beyond Porto Fino.",
    "This spot affected me all the more deeply because it was so dearly loved by the Emperor Frederick III.",
    "In the autumn of 1886 I chanced to be there again when he was revisiting this small forgotten world of happiness for the last time.",
    "It was on these two roads that all _Zarathustra_ came to me, above all, Zarathustra himself as a type--I ought rather to say that it was on these walks that _he waylaid me_.",
    "2",
    "In order to understand this type, you must first be quite clear concerning its fundamental physiological condition: this condition is what I call _great healthiness._",
    "In regard to this idea I cannot make my meaning more plain or more personal than I have done already in one of the last aphorisms (No. 382) of the fifth book of the _Gaya Scienza_: \"We new, nameless, and unfathomable creatures,\" so reads the passage, \"we firstlings of a future still unproved--we who have a new end in view also require new means to that end, that is to say, a new healthiness, a stronger, keener, tougher, bolder, and merrier healthiness than any that has existed heretofore.",
    "He who longs to feel in his own soul the whole range of values and aims that have prevailed on earth until his day, and to sail round all the coasts of this ideal 'Mediterranean Sea'; who, from the adventures of his own inmost experience, would fain know how it feels to be a conqueror and discoverer of the ideal;--as also how it is with the artist, the saint, the legislator, the sage, the scholar, the man of piety and the godlike anchorite of yore;--such a man requires one thing above all for his purpose, and that is, _great healthiness_--such healthiness as he not only possesses, but also constantly acquires and must acquire, because he is continually sacrificing it again, and is compelled to sacrifice it!",
    "And now, therefore, after having been long on the way, we Argonauts of the ideal, whose pluck is greater than prudence would allow, and who are often shipwrecked and bruised, but, as I have said, healthier than people would like to admit, dangerously healthy, and for ever recovering our health--it would seem as if we had before us, as a reward for all our toils, a country still undiscovered, the horizon of which no one has yet seen, a beyond to every country and every refuge of the ideal that man has ever known, a world so overflowing with beauty, strangeness, doubt, terror, and divinity, that both our curiosity and our lust of possession are frantic with eagerness.",
    "Alas!",
    "how in the face of such vistas, and with such burning desire in our conscience and consciousness, could we still be content with _the man of the present day_?",
    "This is bad indeed; but, that we should regard his worthiest aims and hopes with ill-concealed amusement, or perhaps give them no thought at all, is inevitable.",
    "Another ideal now leads us on, a wonderful, seductive ideal, full of danger, the pursuit of which we should be loath to urge upon any one, because we are not so ready to acknowledge any one's _right to it:_ the ideal of a spirit who plays ingenuously (that is to say, involuntarily, and as the outcome of superabundant energy and power) with everything that, hitherto, has been called holy, good, inviolable, and divine; to whom even the loftiest thing that the people have with reason made their measure of value would be no better than a danger, a decay, and an abasement, or at least a relaxation and temporary forgetfulness of self: the ideal of a humanly superhuman well-being and goodwill, which often enough will seem inhuman--as when, for instance, it stands beside all past earnestness on earth, and all past solemnities in hearing, speech, tone, look, morality, and duty, as their most lifelike and unconscious parody--but with which, nevertheless, _great earnestness_ perhaps alone begins, the first note of interrogation is affixed, the fate of the soul changes, the hour hand moves, and tragedy begins.\"",
    "3 Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration?",
    "If not, I will describe it.",
    "If one had the smallest vestige of superstition left in one, it would hardly be possible completely to set aside the idea that one is the mere incarnation, mouthpiece, or medium of an almighty power.",
    "The idea of revelation, in the sense that something which profoundly convulses and upsets one becomes suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy--describes the simple fact.",
    "One hears--one does not seek; one takes--one does not ask who gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes with necessity, without faltering--I have never had any choice in the matter.",
    "There is an ecstasy so great that the immense strain of it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears, during which one's steps now involuntarily rush and anon involuntarily lag.",
    "There is the feeling that one is utterly out of hand, with the very distinct consciousness of an endless number of fine thrills and titillations descending to one's very toes;--there is a depth of happiness in which the most painful and gloomy parts do not act as antitheses to the rest, but are produced and required as necessary shades of colour in such an overflow of light.",
    "There is an instinct for rhythmic relations which embraces a whole world of forms (length, the need of a wide-embracing rhythm, is almost the measure of the force of an inspiration, a sort of counterpart to its pressure and tension).",
    "Everything happens quite involuntarily, as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom, of absoluteness, of power and divinity.",
    "The involuntary nature of the figures and similes is the most remarkable thing; one loses all perception of what is imagery and metaphor; everything seems to present itself as the readiest, the truest, and simplest means of expression.",
    "It actually seems, to use one of Zarathustra's own phrases, as if all things came to one, and offered themselves as similes.",
    "(\"Here do all things come caressingly to thy discourse and flatter thee, for they would fain ride upon thy back.",

    "I tried to leave it.",
    "I wanted to go to Aquila--the opposite of Rome in every respect, and actually founded in a spirit of hostility towards that city, just as I also shall found a city some day, as a memento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the Church, a person very closely related to me, the great Hohenstaufen, the Emperor Frederick II.",
    "But Fate lay behind it all: I had to return again to Rome.",

    "In a chamber high above the Piazza just mentioned, from which one obtained a general view of Rome, and could hear the fountains plashing far below, the loneliest of all songs was composed--\"The Night-Song.\"",

    "In the ensuing winter, beneath the halcyon sky of Nice, which then for the first time poured its light into my life, I found the third _Zarathustra_--and came to the end of my task: the whole having occupied me scarcely a year.",
    "Many hidden corners and heights in the country round about Nice are hallowed for me by moments that I can never forget.",
    "That decisive chapter, entitled \"Old and New Tables,\" was composed during the arduous ascent from the station to Eza--that wonderful Moorish village in the rocks.",
    "During those moments when my creative energy flowed most plentifully, my muscular activity was always greatest.",

    "A man pays dearly for being immortal: to this end he must die many times over during his life.",

    "At the best one encounters a sort of revolt.",
    "This feeling of revolt, I suffered, in varying degrees of intensity, at the hands of almost every one who came near me; it would seem that nothing inflicts a deeper wound than suddenly to make one's distance felt.",
    "Those noble natures are scarce who know not how to live unless they can revere.",
    "A third thing is the absurd susceptibility of the skin to small pin-pricks, a kind of helplessness in the presence of all small things.",
    "This seems to me a necessary outcome of the appalling expenditure of all defensive forces, which is the first condition of every _creative_ act, of every act which proceeds from the most intimate, most secret, and most concealed recesses of a man's being.",
    "The small defensive forces are thus, as it were, suspended, and no fresh energy reaches them.",
    "I even think it probable that one does not digest so well, that one is less willing to move, and that one is much too open to sensations of coldness and suspicion; for, in a large number of cases, suspicion is merely a blunder in etiology.",

    "There is not a single passage in this revelation of truth which had already been anticipated and divined by even the greatest among men.",

    "See with what delicate fingers he touches his very adversaries, the priests, and how he suffers with them from themselves!",
    "Here, at every moment, man is overcome, and the concept \"Superman\" becomes the greatest reality,--out of sight, almost far away beneath him, lies all that which heretofore has been called great in man.",
    "The halcyonic brightness, the light feet, the presence of wickedness and exuberance throughout, and all that is the essence of the type Zarathustra, was never dreamt of before as a prerequisite of greatness.",

    "how can he who has the hardest and most terrible grasp of reality, and who has thought the most \"abysmal thoughts,\" nevertheless avoid conceiving these things as objections to existence, or even as objections to the eternal recurrence of existence?--how is it that on the contrary he finds reasons for _being himself_ the eternal affirmation of all things, \"the tremendous and unlimited saying of Yea and Amen\"?...",

MENCKEN 7 AUTHOR'S PREFACE 37 THE ANTICHRIST 41 INTRODUCTION Save for his raucous, rhapsodical autobiography, \"Ecce Homo,\" \"The Antichrist\" is the last thing that Nietzsche ever wrote, and so it may be accepted as a statement of some of his most salient ideas in their final form.",
    "Notes for it had been accumulating for years and it was to have constituted the first volume of his long-projected _magnum opus_, \"The Will to Power.\"",
    "His full plan for this work, as originally drawn up, was as follows: Vol. I.",
    "The Antichrist: an Attempt at a Criticism of Christianity.",
    "Vol. II.",
    "The Free Spirit: a Criticism of Philosophy as a Nihilistic Movement.",
    "Vol. III.",
    "The Immoralist: a Criticism of Morality, the Most Fatal Form of Ignorance.",
    "Vol. IV.",
    "Dionysus: the Philosophy of Eternal Recurrence.",
    "The first sketches for \"The Will to Power\" were made in 1884, soon after the publication of the first three parts of \"Thus Spake Zarathustra,\" and thereafter, for four years, Nietzsche piled up notes.",
    "They were written at all the places he visited on his endless travels in search of health--at Nice, at Venice, at Sils-Maria in the Engadine (for long his favourite resort), at Cannobio, at Zuerich, at Genoa, at Chur, at Leipzig.",
    "Several times his work was interrupted by other books, first by \"Beyond Good and Evil,\" then by \"The Genealogy of Morals\" (written in twenty days), then by his Wagner pamphlets.",
    "Almost as often he changed his plan.",
    "Once he decided to expand \"The Will to Power\" to ten volumes, with \"An Attempt at a New Interpretation of the World\" as a general sub-title.",
    "Again he adopted the sub-title of \"An Interpretation of All That Happens.\"",
    "Finally, he hit upon \"An Attempt at a Transvaluation of All Values,\" and went back to four volumes, though with a number of changes in their arrangement.",
    "In September, 1888, he began actual work upon the first volume, and before the end of the month it was completed.",
    "The Summer had been one of almost hysterical creative activity.",
    "Since the middle of June he had written two other small books, \"The Case of Wagner\" and \"The Twilight of the Idols,\" and before the end of the year he was destined to write \"Ecce Homo.\"",
    "Some time during December his health began to fail rapidly, and soon after the New Year he was helpless.",
    "Thereafter he wrote no more.",
    "The Wagner diatribe and \"The Twilight of the Idols\" were published immediately, but \"The Antichrist\" did not get into type until 1895.",
    "I suspect that the delay was due to the influence of the philosopher's sister, Elisabeth Foerster-Nietzsche, an intelligent and ardent but by no means uniformly judicious propagandist of his ideas.",
    "During his dark days of neglect and misunderstanding, when even family and friends kept aloof, Frau Foerster-Nietzsche went with him farther than any other, but there were bounds beyond which she, also, hesitated to go, and those bounds were marked by crosses.",
    "One notes, in her biography of him--a useful but not always accurate work--an evident desire to purge him of the accusation of mocking at sacred things.",
    "He had, she says, great admiration for \"the elevating effect of Christianity ... upon the weak and ailing,\" and \"a real liking for sincere, pious Christians,\" and \"a tender love for the Founder of Christianity.\"",
    "All his wrath, she continues, was reserved for \"St. Paul and his like,\" who perverted the Beatitudes, which Christ intended for the lowly only, into a universal religion which made war upon aristocratic values.",
    "Here, obviously, one is addressed by an interpreter who cannot forget that she is the daughter of a Lutheran pastor and the grand-daughter of two others; a touch of conscience gets into her reading of \"The Antichrist.\"",
    "She even hints that the text may have been garbled, after the author's collapse, by some more sinister heretic.",
    "There is not the slightest reason to believe that any such garbling ever took place, nor is there any evidence that their common heritage of piety rested upon the brother as heavily as it rested upon the sister.",
    "On the contrary, it must be manifest that Nietzsche, in this book, intended to attack Christianity headlong and with all arms, that for all his rapid writing he put the utmost care into it, and that he wanted it to be printed exactly as it stands.",
    "The ideas in it were anything but new to him when he set them down.",
    "He had been developing them since the days of his beginning.",
    "You will find some of them, clearly recognizable, in the first book he ever wrote, \"The Birth of Tragedy.\"",
    "You will find the most important of all of them--the conception of Christianity as _ressentiment_--set forth at length in the first part of \"The Genealogy of Morals,\" published under his own supervision in 1887.",
    "And the rest are scattered through the whole vast mass of his notes, sometimes as mere questionings but often worked out very carefully.",
    "Moreover, let it not be forgotten that it was Wagner's yielding to Christian sentimentality in \"Parsifal\" that transformed Nietzsche from the first among his literary advocates into the most bitter of his opponents.",
    "He could forgive every other sort of mountebankery, but not that.",
    "\"In me,\" he once said, \"the Christianity of my forbears reaches its logical conclusion.",
    "In me the stern intellectual conscience that Christianity fosters and makes paramount turns _against_ Christianity.",
    "In me Christianity ... devours itself.\"",
    "In truth, the present philippic is as necessary to the completeness of the whole of Nietzsche's system as the keystone is to the arch.",
    "All the curves of his speculation lead up to it.",
    "What he flung himself against, from beginning to end of his days of writing, was always, in the last analysis, Christianity in some form or other--Christianity as a system of practical ethics, Christianity as a political code, Christianity as metaphysics, Christianity as a gauge of the truth.",
    "It would be difficult to think of any intellectual enterprise on his long list that did not, more or less directly and clearly, relate itself to this master enterprise of them all.",
    "It was as if his apostasy from the faith of his fathers, filling him with the fiery zeal of the convert, and particularly of the convert to heresy, had blinded him to every other element in the gigantic self-delusion of civilized man.",
    "The will to power was his answer to Christianity's affectation of humility and self-sacrifice; eternal recurrence was his mocking criticism of Christian optimism and millennialism; the superman was his candidate for the place of the Christian ideal of the \"good\" man, prudently abased before the throne of God.",
    "The things he chiefly argued for were anti-Christian things--the abandonment of the purely moral view of life, the rehabilitation of instinct, the dethronement of weakness and timidity as ideals, the renunciation of the whole hocus-pocus of dogmatic religion, the extermination of false aristocracies (of the priest, of the politician, of the plutocrat), the revival of the healthy, lordly \"innocence\" that was Greek.",
    "If he was anything in a word, Nietzsche was a Greek born two thousand years too late.",
    "His dreams were thoroughly Hellenic; his whole manner of thinking was Hellenic; his peculiar errors were Hellenic no less.",
    "But his Hellenism, I need not add, was anything but the pale neo-Platonism that has run like a thread through the thinking of the Western world since the days of the Christian Fathers.",
    "From Plato, to be sure, he got what all of us must get, but his real forefather was Heraclitus.",
    "It is in Heraclitus that one finds the germ of his primary view of the universe--a view, to wit, that sees it, not as moral phenomenon, but as mere aesthetic representation.",
    "The God that Nietzsche imagined, in the end, was not far from the God that such an artist as Joseph Conrad imagines--a supreme craftsman, ever experimenting, ever coming closer to an ideal balancing of lines and forces, and yet always failing to work out the final harmony.",
    "The late war, awakening all the primitive racial fury of the Western nations, and therewith all their ancient enthusiasm for religious taboos and sanctions, naturally focused attention upon Nietzsche, as upon the most daring and provocative of recent amateur theologians.",
    "The Germans, with their characteristic tendency to explain their every act in terms as realistic and unpleasant as possible, appear to have mauled him in a belated and unexpected embrace, to the horror, I daresay, of the Kaiser, and perhaps to the even greater horror of Nietzsche's own ghost.",
    "The folks of Anglo-Saxondom, with their equally characteristic tendency to explain all their enterprises romantically, simultaneously set him up as the Antichrist he no doubt secretly longed to be.",
    "The result was a great deal of misrepresentation and misunderstanding of him.",
    "From the pulpits of the allied countries, and particularly from those of England and the United States, a horde of patriotic ecclesiastics denounced him in extravagant terms as the author of all the horrors of the time, and in the newspapers, until the Kaiser was elected sole bugaboo, he shared the honors of that office with von Hindenburg, the Crown Prince, Capt. Boy-Ed, von Bernstorff and von Tirpitz.",
    "Most of this denunciation, of course, was frankly idiotic--the naive pishposh of suburban Methodists, notoriety-seeking college professors, almost illiterate editorial writers, and other such numskulls.",
    "In much of it, including not a few official hymns of hate, Nietzsche was gravely discovered to be the teacher of such spokesmen of the extremest sort of German nationalism as von Bernhardi and von Treitschke--which was just as intelligent as making George Bernard Shaw the mentor of Lloyd-George.",
    "In other solemn pronunciamentoes he was credited with being philosophically responsible for various imaginary crimes of the enemy--the wholesale slaughter or mutilation of prisoners of war, the deliberate burning down of Red Cross hospitals, the utilization of the corpses of the slain for soap-making.",
    "I amused myself, in those gaudy days, by collecting newspaper clippings to this general effect, and later on I shall probably publish a digest of them, as a contribution to the study of war hysteria.",
    "The thing went to unbelievable lengths.",
    "On the strength of the fact that I had published a book on Nietzsche in 1906, six years after his death, I was called upon by agents of the Department of Justice, elaborately outfitted with badges, to meet the charge that I was an intimate associate and agent of \"the German monster, Nietzsky.\"",
    "I quote the official _proces verbal_, an indignant but often misspelled document.",
    "Alas, poor Nietzsche!",
    "After all his laborious efforts to prove that he was not a German, but a Pole--even after his heroic readiness, via anti-anti-Semitism, to meet the deduction",
    "that, if a Pole, then probably also a Jew!",
    "But under all this alarmed and preposterous tosh there was at least a sound instinct, and that was the instinct which recognized Nietzsche as the most eloquent, pertinacious and effective of all the critics of the philosophy to which the Allies against Germany stood committed, and on the strength of which, at all events in theory, the United States had engaged itself in the war.",
    "He was not, in point of fact, involved with the visible enemy, save in remote and transient ways; the German, officially, remained the most ardent of Christians during the war and became a democrat at its close.",
    "But he was plainly a foe of democracy in all its forms, political, religious and epistemological, and what is worse, his opposition was set forth in terms that were not only extraordinarily penetrating and devastating, but also uncommonly offensive.",
    "It was thus quite natural that he should have aroused a degree of indignation verging upon the pathological in the two countries that had planted themselves upon the democratic platform most boldly, and that felt it most shaky, one may add, under their feet.",
    "I daresay that Nietzsche, had he been alive, would have got a lot of satisfaction out of the execration thus heaped upon him, not only because, being a vain fellow, he enjoyed execration as a tribute to his general singularity, and hence to his superiority, but also and more importantly because, being no mean psychologist, he would have recognized the disconcerting doubts underlying it.",
    "If Nietzsche's criticism of democracy were as ignorant and empty, say, as the average evangelical clergyman's criticism of Darwin's hypothesis of natural selection, then the advocates of democracy could afford to dismiss it as loftily as the Darwinians dismiss the blather of the holy clerks.",
    "And if his attack upon Christianity were mere sound and fury, signifying nothing, then there would be no call for anathemas from the sacred desk.",
    "But these onslaughts, in point of fact, have behind them a tremendous learning and a great deal of point and plausibility--there are, in brief, bullets in the gun, teeth in the tiger,--and",
    "so it is no wonder that they excite the ire of men who hold, as a primary article of belief, that their acceptance would destroy civilization, darken the sun, and bring Jahveh to sobs upon His Throne.",
    "But in all this justifiable fear, of course, there remains a false assumption, and that is the assumption that Nietzsche proposed to destroy Christianity altogether, and so rob the plain people of the world of their virtue, their spiritual consolations, and their hope of heaven.",
    "Nothing could be more untrue.",
    "The fact is that Nietzsche had no interest whatever in the delusions of the plain people--that is, intrinsically.",
    "It seemed to him of small moment _what_ they believed, so long as it was safely imbecile.",
    "What he stood against was not their beliefs, but the elevation of those beliefs, by any sort of democratic process, to the dignity of a state philosophy--what he feared most was the pollution and crippling of the superior minority by intellectual disease from below.",
    "His plain aim in \"The Antichrist\" was to combat that menace by completing the work begun, on the one hand, by Darwin and the other evolutionist philosophers, and, on the other hand, by German historians and philologians.",
    "The net effect of this earlier attack, in the eighties, had been the collapse of Christian theology as a serious concern of educated men.",
    "The mob, it must be obvious, was very little shaken; even to this day it has not put off its belief in the essential Christian doctrines.",
    "But the _intelligentsia_, by 1885, had been pretty well convinced.",
    "No man of sound information, at the time Nietzsche planned \"The Antichrist,\" actually believed that the world was created in seven days, or that its fauna was once overwhelmed by a flood as a penalty for the sins of man, or that Noah saved the boa constrictor, the prairie dog and the _pediculus capitis_ by taking a pair of each into the ark, or that Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt, or that a fragment of the True Cross could cure hydrophobia.",
    "Such notions, still almost universally prevalent in Christendom a century before, were now confined to the great body of ignorant and credulous men--that is, to ninety-five or ninety-six percent.",
    "of the race.",
    "For a man of the superior minority to subscribe to one of them publicly was already sufficient to set him off as one in imminent need of psychiatrical attention.",
    "Belief in them had become a mark of inferiority, like the allied belief in madstones, magic and apparitions.",
    "But though the theology of Christianity had thus sunk to the lowly estate of a mere delusion of the rabble, propagated on that level by the ancient caste of sacerdotal parasites, the ethics of Christianity continued to enjoy the utmost acceptance, and perhaps even more acceptance than ever before.",
    "It seemed to be generally felt, in fact, that they simply _must_ be saved from the wreck--that the world would vanish into chaos if they went the way of the revelations supporting them.",
    "In this fear a great many judicious men joined, and so there arose what was, in essence, an absolutely new Christian cult--a cult, to wit, purged of all the supernaturalism superimposed upon the older cult by generations of theologians, and harking back to what was conceived to be the pure ethical doctrine of Jesus.",
    "This cult still flourishes; Protestantism tends to become identical with it; it invades Catholicism as Modernism; it is supported by great numbers of men whose intelligence is manifest and whose sincerity is not open to question.",
    "Even Nietzsche himself yielded to it in weak moments, as you will discover on examining his somewhat laborious effort to make Paul the villain of Christian theology, and Jesus no more than an innocent bystander.",
    "But this sentimental yielding never went far enough to distract his attention for long from his main idea, which was this: that Christian ethics were quite as dubious, at bottom, as Christian theology--that they were founded, just as surely as such childish fables as the story of Jonah and the whale, upon the peculiar prejudices and credulities, the special desires and appetites, of inferior men--that they warred upon the best interests of men of a better sort quite as unmistakably as the most extravagant of objective superstitions.",
    "In brief, what he saw in Christian ethics, under all the poetry and all the fine show of altruism and all the theoretical benefits therein, was a democratic effort to curb the egoism of the strong--a conspiracy of the _chandala_ against the free functioning of their superiors, nay, against the free progress of mankind.",
    "This theory is the thing he exposes in \"The Antichrist,\" bringing to the business his amazingly chromatic and exigent eloquence at its finest flower.",
    "This is the \"conspiracy\" he sets forth in all the panoply of his characteristic italics, dashes, _sforzando_ interjections and exclamation points.",
    "Well, an idea is an idea.",
    "The present one may be right and it may be wrong.",
    "One thing is quite certain: that no progress will be made against it by denouncing it as merely immoral.",
    "If it is ever laid at all, it must be laid evidentially, logically.",
    "The notion to the contrary is thoroughly democratic; the mob is the most ruthless of tyrants; it is always in a democratic society that heresy and felony tend to be most constantly confused.",
    "One hears without surprise of a Bismarck philosophizing placidly (at least in his old age) upon the delusion of Socialism and of a Frederick the Great playing the hose of his cynicism upon the absolutism that was almost identical with his own person, but men in the mass never brook the destructive discussion of their fundamental beliefs, and that impatience is naturally most evident in those societies in which men in the mass are most influential.",
    "Democracy and free speech are not facets of one gem; democracy and free speech are eternal enemies.",
    "But in any battle between an institution and an idea, the idea, in the long run, has the better of it.",
    "Here I do not venture into the absurdity of arguing that, as the world wags on, the truth always survives.",
    "I believe nothing of the sort.",
    "As a matter of fact, it seems to me that an idea that happens to be true--or, more exactly, as near to truth as any human idea can be, and yet remain generally intelligible--it seems to me that such an idea carries a special and often fatal handicap.",
    "The majority of men prefer delusion to truth.",
    "It soothes.",
    "It is easy to grasp.",
    "Above all, it fits more snugly than the truth into a universe of false appearances--of complex and irrational phenomena, defectively grasped.",
    "But though an idea that is true is thus not likely to prevail, an idea that is _attacked_ enjoys a great advantage.",
    "The evidence behind it is now supported by sympathy, the sporting instinct, sentimentality--and sentimentality is as powerful as an army with banners.",
    "One never hears of a martyr in history whose notions are seriously disputed today.",
    "The forgotten ideas are those of the men who put them forward soberly and quietly, hoping fatuously that they would conquer by the force of their truth; these are the ideas that we now struggle to rediscover.",
    "Had Nietzsche lived to be burned at the stake by outraged Mississippi Methodists, it would have been a glorious day for his doctrines.",
    "As it is, they are helped on their way every time they are denounced as immoral and against God.",
    "The war brought down upon them the maledictions of vast herds of right-thinking men.",
    "And now \"The Antichrist,\" after fifteen years of neglect, is being reprinted....",
    "One imagines the author, a sardonic wraith, snickering somewhat sadly over the fact.",
    "His shade, wherever it suffers, is favoured in these days by many such consolations, some of them of much greater horsepower.",
    "Think of the facts and arguments, even the underlying theories and attitudes, that have been borrowed from him, consciously and unconsciously, by the foes of Bolshevism during these last thrilling years!",
    "The face of democracy, suddenly seen hideously close, has scared the guardians of the reigning plutocracy half to death, and they have gone to the devil himself for aid.",
    "Southern Senators, almost illiterate men, have mixed his acids with well water and spouted them like affrighted geysers, not knowing what they did.",
    "Nor are they the first to borrow from him.",
    "Years ago I called attention to the debt incurred with characteristic forgetfulness of obligation by the late Theodore Roosevelt, in \"The Strenuous Life\" and elsewhere.",
    "Roosevelt, a typical apologist for the existing order, adeptly dragging a herring across the trail whenever it was menaced, yet managed to delude the native boobery, at least until toward the end, into accepting him as a fiery exponent of pure democracy.",
    "Perhaps he even fooled himself; charlatans usually do so soon or late.",
    "A study of Nietzsche reveals the sources of much that was honest in him, and exposes the hollowness of much that was sham.",
    "Nietzsche, an infinitely harder and more courageous intellect, was incapable of any such confusion of ideas; he seldom allowed sentimentality to turn him from the glaring fact.",
    "What is called Bolshevism today he saw clearly a generation ago and described for what it was and is--democracy in another aspect, the old _ressentiment_ of the lower orders in free function once more.",
    "Socialism, Puritanism, Philistinism, Christianity--he saw them all as allotropic forms of democracy, as variations upon the endless struggle of quantity against quality, of the weak and timorous against the strong and enterprising, of the botched against the fit.",
    "The world needed a staggering exaggeration to make it see even half of the truth.",
    "It trembles today as it trembled during the French Revolution.",
    "Perhaps it would tremble less if it could combat the monster with a clearer conscience and less burden of compromising theory--if it could launch its forces frankly at the fundamental doctrine, and not merely employ them to police the transient orgy.",
    "Nietzsche, in the long run, may help it toward that greater honesty.",
    "His notions, propagated by cuttings from cuttings from cuttings, may conceivably prepare the way for a sounder, more healthful theory of society and of the state, and so free human progress from the stupidities which now hamper it, and men of true vision from the despairs which now sicken them.",
    "I say it is conceivable, but I doubt that it is probable.",
    "The soul and the belly of mankind are too evenly balanced; it is not likely that the belly will ever put away its hunger or forget its power.",
    "Here, perhaps, there is an example of the eternal recurrence that Nietzsche was fond of mulling over in his blacker moods.",
    "We are in the midst of one of the perennial risings of the lower orders.",
    "It got under way long before any of the current Bolshevist demons was born; it was given its long, secure start by the intolerable tyranny of the plutocracy--the end product of the Eighteenth Century revolt against the old aristocracy.",
    "It found resistance suddenly slackened by civil war within the plutocracy itself--one gang of traders falling upon another gang, to the tune of vast hymn-singing and yells to God.",
    "Perhaps it has already passed its apogee; the plutocracy, chastened, shows signs of a new solidarity; the wheel continues to swing 'round.",
    "But this combat between proletariat and plutocracy is, after all, itself a civil war.",
    "Two inferiorities struggle for the privilege of polluting the world.",
    "What actual difference does it make to a civilized man, when there is a steel strike, whether the workmen win or the mill-owners win?",
    "The conflict can interest him only as spectacle, as the conflict between Bonaparte and the old order in Europe interested Goethe and Beethoven.",
    "The victory, whichever way it goes, will simply bring chaos nearer, and so set the stage for a genuine revolution later on, with (let us hope) a new feudalism or something better coming out of it, and a new Thirteenth Century at dawn.",
    "This seems to be the slow, costly way of the worst of habitable worlds.",
    "In the present case my money is laid upon the plutocracy.",
    "It will win because it will be able, in the long run, to enlist the finer intelligences.",
    "The mob and its maudlin causes attract only sentimentalists and scoundrels, chiefly the latter.",
    "Politics, under a democracy, reduces itself to a mere struggle for office by flatterers of the proletariat; even when a superior man prevails at that disgusting game he must prevail at the cost of his self-respect.",
    "Not many superior men make the attempt.",
    "The average great captain of the rabble, when he is not simply a weeper over irremediable wrongs, is a hypocrite so far gone that he is unconscious of his own hypocrisy--a slimy fellow, offensive to the nose.",
    "The plutocracy can recruit measurably more respectable janissaries, if only because it can make self-interest less obviously costly to _amour propre_.",
    "Its defect and its weakness lie in the fact that it is still too young to have acquired dignity.",
    "But lately sprung from the mob it now preys upon, it yet shows some of the habits of mind of that mob: it is blatant, stupid, ignorant, lacking in all delicate instinct and governmental finesse.",
    "Above all, it remains somewhat heavily moral.",
    "One seldom finds it undertaking one of its characteristic imbecilities without offering a sonorous moral reason; it spends almost as much to support the Y. M. C. A., vice-crusading, Prohibition and other such puerilities as it spends upon Congressmen, strike-breakers, gun-men, kept patriots and newspapers.",
    "In England the case is even worse.",
    "It is almost impossible to find a wealthy industrial over there who is not also an eminent non-conformist layman, and even among financiers there are praying brothers.",
    "On the Continent, the day is saved by the fact that the plutocracy tends to become more and more Jewish.",
    "Here the intellectual cynicism of the Jew almost counterbalances his social unpleasantness.",
    "If he is destined to lead the plutocracy of the world out of Little Bethel he will fail, of course, to turn it into an aristocracy--_i.",
    "e._, a caste of gentlemen--, but he will at least make it clever, and hence worthy of consideration.",
    "The case against the Jews is long and damning; it would justify ten thousand times as many pogroms as now go on in the world.",
    "But whenever you find a Davidsbuendlerschaft making practise against the Philistines, there you will find a Jew laying on.",
    "Maybe it was this fact that caused Nietzsche to speak up for the children of Israel quite as often as he spoke against them.",
    "He was not blind to their faults, but when he set them beside Christians he could not deny their general superiority.",
    "Perhaps in America and England, as on the Continent, the increasing Jewishness of the plutocracy, while cutting it off from all chance of ever developing into an aristocracy, will yet lift it to such a dignity that it will at least deserve a certain grudging respect.",
    "But even so, it will remain in a sort of half-world, midway between the gutter and the stars.",
    "Above it will still stand the small group of men that constitutes the permanent aristocracy of the race--the men of imagination and high purpose, the makers of genuine progress, the brave and ardent spirits, above all petty fears and discontents and above all petty hopes and ideals no less.",
    "There were heroes before Agamemnon; there will be Bachs after Johann Sebastian.",
    "And beneath the Judaized plutocracy, the sublimated _bourgeoisie_, there the immemorial proletariat, I venture to guess, will roar on, endlessly tortured by its vain hatreds and envies, stampeded and made to tremble by its ancient superstitions, prodded and made miserable by its sordid and degrading hopes.",
    "It seems to me very likely that, in this proletariat, Christianity will continue to survive.",
    "It is nonsense, true enough, but it is sweet.",
    "Nietzsche, denouncing its dangers as a poison, almost falls into the error of denying it its undoubtedly sugary smack.",
    "Of all the religions ever devised by the great practical jokers of the race, this is the one that offers most for the least money, so to speak, to the inferior man.",
    "It starts out by denying his inferiority in plain terms: _all_ men are equal in the sight of God.",
    "It ends by erecting that inferiority into a sort of actual superiority: it is a merit to be stupid, and miserable, and sorely put upon--of such are the celestial elect.",
    "Not all the eloquence of a million Nietzsches, nor all the painful marshalling of evidence of a million Darwins and Harnacks, will ever empty that great consolation of its allure.",
    "The most they can ever accomplish is to make the superior orders of men acutely conscious of the exact nature of it, and so give them armament against the contagion.",
    "This is going on; this is being done.",
    "I think that \"The Antichrist\" has a useful place in that enterprise.",
    "It is strident, it is often extravagant, it is, to many sensitive men, in the worst of possible taste, but at bottom it is enormously apt and effective--and on the surface it is undoubtedly a good show.",
    "One somehow enjoys, with the malice that is native to man, the spectacle of anathemas batted back; it is refreshing to see the pitchfork employed against gentlemen who have doomed such innumerable caravans to hell.",
    "In Nietzsche they found, after many long years, a foeman worthy of them--not a mere fancy swordsman like Voltaire, or a mob orator like Tom Paine, or a pedant like the heretics of exegesis, but a gladiator armed with steel and armoured with steel, and showing all the ferocious gusto of a mediaeval bishop.",
    "It is a pity that Holy Church has no process for the elevation of demons, like its process for the canonization of saints.",
    "There must be a long roll of black miracles to the discredit of the Accursed Friedrich--sinners purged of conscience and made happy in their sinning, clerics shaken in their theology by visions of a new and better holy city, the strong made to exult, the weak robbed of their old sad romance.",
    "It would be a pleasure to see the _Advocatus Diaboli_ turn from the table of the prosecution to the table of the defence, and move in solemn form for the damnation of the Naumburg hobgoblin....",
    "Of all Nietzsche's books",
    ", \"The Antichrist\" comes nearest to conventionality in form.",
    "It presents a connected argument with very few interludes, and has a beginning, a middle and an end.",
    "Most of his works are in the form of collections of apothegms, and sometimes the subject changes on every second page.",
    "This fact constitutes one of the counts in the orthodox indictment of him: it is cited as proof that his capacity for consecutive thought was limited, and that he was thus deficient mentally, and perhaps a downright moron.",
    "The argument, it must be obvious, is fundamentally nonsensical.",
    "What deceives the professors is the traditional prolixity of philosophers.",
    "Because the average philosophical writer, when he essays to expose his ideas, makes such inordinate drafts upon the parts of speech that the dictionary is almost emptied these defective observers jump to the conclusion that his intrinsic notions are of corresponding weight.",
    "This is not unseldom quite untrue.",
    "What makes philosophy so garrulous is not the profundity of philosophers, but their lack of art; they are like physicians who sought to cure a slight hyperacidity by giving the patient a carload of burned oyster-shells to eat.",
    "There is, too, the endless poll-parrotting that goes on: each new philosopher must prove his learning by laboriously rehearsing the ideas of all previous philosophers....",
    "Nietzsche avoided both faults.",

    "There exists, in fact, a huge and solemn tome on Nietzsche by a learned man of America in which all of his brilliancy is painfully translated into the windy phrases of the seminaries.",

    "He must have become indifferent; he must never ask of the truth whether it brings profit to him or a fatality to him....",
    "He must have an inclination, born of strength, for questions that no one has the courage for; the courage for the _forbidden_; predestination for the labyrinth.",

    "What is happiness?--The feeling that power _increases_--that resistance is overcome.",
    "Not contentment, but more power; _not_ peace at any price, but war; _not_ virtue, but efficiency (virtue in the Renaissance sense, _virtu_, virtue free of moral acid).",

    "What is more harmful than any vice?--Practical sympathy for the botched and the weak--Christianity.... 3.",
    "The problem that I set here is not what shall replace mankind in the order of living creatures (--man is an end--): but what type of man must be _bred_, must be _willed_, as being the most valuable, the most worthy of life, the most secure guarantee of the future.",
    "This more valuable type has appeared often enough in the past: but always as a happy accident, as an exception, never as deliberately _willed_.",
    "Very often it has been precisely the most feared; hitherto it has been almost _the_ terror of terrors;--and out of that terror the contrary type has been willed, cultivated and _attained_: the domestic animal, the herd animal, the sick brute-man--the Christian.... 4.",
    "Mankind surely does _not_ represent an evolution toward a better or stronger or higher level, as progress is now understood.",
    "This \"progress\" is merely a modern idea, which is to say, a false idea.",
    "The European of today, in his essential worth, falls far below the European of the Renaissance; the process of evolution does _not_ necessarily mean elevation, enhancement, strengthening.",
    "True enough, it succeeds in isolated and individual cases in various parts of the earth and under the most widely different cultures, and in these cases a _higher_ type certainly manifests itself; something which, compared to mankind in the mass, appears as a sort of superman.",
    "Such happy strokes of high success have always been possible, and will remain possible, perhaps, for all time to come.",
    "Even whole races, tribes and nations may occasionally represent such lucky accidents.",
    "5. We should not deck out and embellish Christianity: it has waged a war to the death against this _higher_ type of man, it has put all the deepest instincts of this type under its ban, it has developed its concept of evil, of the Evil One himself, out of these instincts--the strong man as the typical reprobate, the \"outcast among men.\"",
    "Christianity has taken the part of all the weak, the low, the botched; it has made an ideal out of _antagonism_ to all the self-preservative instincts of sound life; it has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are intellectually most vigorous, by representing the highest intellectual values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation.",
    "The most lamentable example: the corruption of Pascal, who believed that his intellect had been destroyed by original sin, whereas it was actually destroyed by Christianity!-- 6.",
    "It is a painful and tragic spectacle that rises before me: I have drawn back the curtain from the _rottenness_ of man.",
    "This word, in my mouth, is at least free from one suspicion: that it involves a moral accusation against humanity.",
    "It is used--and I wish to emphasize the fact again--without any moral significance: and this is so far true that the rottenness I speak of is most apparent to me precisely in those quarters where there has been most aspiration, hitherto, toward \"virtue\" and \"godliness.\"",
    "As you probably surmise, I understand rottenness in the sense of _decadence_:",
    "my argument is that all the values on which mankind now fixes its highest aspirations are _decadence_-values.",
    "I call an animal, a species, an individual corrupt, when it loses its instincts, when it chooses, when it _prefers_, what is injurious to it.",
    "A history of the \"higher feelings,\" the \"ideals of humanity\"--and it is possible that I'll have to write it--would almost explain why man is so degenerate.",
    "Life itself appears to me as an instinct for growth, for survival, for the accumulation of forces, for _power_: whenever the will to power fails there is disaster.",
    "My contention is that all the highest values of humanity have been emptied of this will--that the values of _decadence_, of _nihilism_, now prevail under the holiest names.",
    "7.",
    "Christianity is called the religion of _pity_.--Pity stands in opposition to all the tonic passions that augment the energy of the feeling of aliveness: it is a depressant.",
    "A man loses power when he pities.",
    "Through pity that drain upon strength which suffering works is multiplied a thousandfold.",
    "Suffering is made contagious by pity; under certain circumstances it may lead to a total sacrifice of life and living energy--a loss out of all proportion to the magnitude of the cause (--the case of the death of the Nazarene).",
    "This is the first view of it; there is, however, a still more important one.",
    "If one measures the effects of pity by the gravity of the reactions it sets up, its character as a menace to life appears in a much clearer light.",
    "Pity thwarts the whole law of evolution, which is the law of natural selection.",
    "It preserves whatever is ripe for destruction; it fights on the side of those disinherited and condemned by life; by maintaining life in so many of the botched of all kinds, it gives life itself a gloomy and dubious aspect.",
    "Mankind has ventured to call pity a virtue (--in every _superior_ moral system it appears as a weakness--); going still further, it has been called _the_ virtue, the source and foundation of all other virtues--but let us always bear in mind that this was from the standpoint of a philosophy that was nihilistic, and upon whose shield _the denial of life_ was inscribed.",
    "Schopenhauer was right in this: that by means of pity life is denied, and made _worthy of denial_--pity is the technic of nihilism.",
    "Let me repeat: this depressing and contagious instinct stands against all those instincts which work for the preservation and enhancement of life: in the role of _protector_ of the miserable, it is a prime agent in the promotion of _decadence_--pity persuades to extinction....",
    "Of course, one doesn't say \"extinction\": one says \"the other world,\" or \"God,\" or \"the _true_ life,\" or Nirvana, salvation, blessedness....",
    "This innocent rhetoric, from the realm of religious-ethical balderdash, appears _a good deal less innocent_ when one reflects upon the tendency that it conceals beneath sublime words: the tendency to _destroy life_.",
    "Schopenhauer was hostile to life: that is why pity appeared to him as a virtue....",
    "Aristotle, as every one knows, saw in pity a sickly and dangerous state of mind, the remedy for which was an occasional purgative: he regarded tragedy as that purgative.",
    "The instinct of life should prompt us to seek some means of puncturing any such pathological and dangerous accumulation of pity as that appearing in Schopenhauer's case (and also, alack, in that of our whole literary _decadence_, from St. Petersburg to Paris, from Tolstoi to Wagner), that it may burst and be discharged....",
    "Nothing is more unhealthy, amid all our unhealthy modernism, than Christian pity.",
    "To be the doctors _here_, to be unmerciful _here_, to wield the knife _",

    "It is necessary to say just _whom_",
    "we regard as our antagonists: theologians and all who have any theological blood in their veins--this is our whole philosophy....",
    "One must have faced that menace at close hand, better still, one must have had experience of it directly and almost succumbed to it, to realize that it is not to be taken lightly (--the alleged free-thinking of our naturalists and physiologists seems to me to be a joke--they have no passion about such things; they have not suffered--).",
    "This poisoning goes a great deal further than most people think: I find the arrogant habit of the theologian among all who regard themselves as \"idealists\"--among all who, by virtue of a higher point of departure, claim a right to rise above reality, and to look upon it with suspicion....",
    "The idealist, like the ecclesiastic, carries all sorts of lofty concepts in his hand (--and not only in his hand!); he launches them with benevolent contempt against \"understanding,\" \"the senses,\" \"honor,\" \"good living,\" \"science\"; he sees such things as _beneath_ him, as pernicious and seductive forces, on which \"the soul\" soars as a pure thing-in-itself--as if humility, chastity, poverty, in a word, _holiness_, had not already done much more damage to life than all imaginable horrors and vices....",
    "The pure soul is a pure lie....",
    "So long as the priest, that _professional_ denier, calumniator and poisoner of life, is accepted as a _higher_ variety of man, there can be no answer to the question, What _is_ truth?",
    "Truth has already been stood on its head when the obvious attorney of mere emptiness is mistaken for its representative....",
    "9. Upon this theological instinct I make war: I find the tracks of it everywhere.",
    "Whoever has theological blood in his veins is shifty and dishonourable in all things.",
    "The pathetic thing that grows out of this condition is called _faith_: in other words, closing one's eyes upon one's self once for all, to avoid suffering the sight of incurable falsehood.",
    "People erect a concept of morality, of virtue, of holiness upon this false view of all things; they ground good conscience upon faulty vision; they argue that no _other_ sort of vision has value any more, once they have made theirs sacrosanct with the names of \"God,\" \"salvation\" and \"eternity.\"",
    "I unearth this theological instinct in all directions: it is the most widespread and the most _subterranean_ form of falsehood to be found on earth.",
    "Whatever a theologian regards as true _must_ be false: there you have almost a criterion of truth.",
    "His profound instinct of self-preservation stands against truth ever coming into honour in any way, or even getting stated.",
    "Wherever the influence of theologians is felt there is a transvaluation of values, and the concepts \"true\" and \"false\" are forced to change places: whatever is most damaging to life is there called \"true,\" and whatever exalts it, intensifies it, approves it, justifies it and makes it triumphant is there called \"false.",
    "\"...",
    "When theologians, working through the \"consciences\" of princes (or of peoples--), stretch out their hands for _power_, there is never any doubt as to the fundamental issue: the will to make an end, the _nihilistic_ will exerts that power....",

    "The Suabians are the best liars in Germany; they lie innocently....",
    "Why all the rejoicing over the appearance of Kant that went through the learned world of Germany, three-fourths of which is made up of the sons of preachers and teachers--why the German conviction still echoing, that with Kant came a change for the _better_?",
    "The theological instinct of German scholars made them see clearly just _",
    "what_ had become possible again....",
    "A backstairs leading to the old ideal stood open; the concept of the \"true world,\" the concept of morality as the _essence_ of the world (--the two most vicious errors that ever existed!), were once more, thanks to a subtle and wily scepticism, if not actually demonstrable, then _at least_ no longer _refutable_.... _Reason_, the _prerogative_ of reason, does not go so far....",
    "Out of reality there had been made \"appearance\"; an absolutely false world, that of being, had been turned into reality....",
    "The success of Kant is merely a theological success; he was, like Luther and Leibnitz, but one more impediment to German integrity, already far from steady.-- 11.",

    "In every other case it is a source of danger.",
    "That which does not belong to our life _menaces_ it; a virtue which has its roots in mere respect for the concept of \"virtue,\" as Kant would have it, is pernicious.",
    "\"Virtue,\" \"duty,\" \"good for its own sake,\" goodness grounded upon impersonality or a notion of universal validity--these are all chimeras, and in them one finds only an expression of the decay, the last collapse of life, the Chinese spirit of Koenigsberg.",

    "A nation goes to pieces when it confounds _its_ duty with the general concept of duty.",
    "Nothing works a more complete and penetrating disaster than every \"impersonal\" duty, every sacrifice before the Moloch of abstraction.--To think that no one has thought of Kant's categorical imperative as _dangerous to life_!...",
    "The theological instinct alone took it under protection!--An action prompted by the life-instinct proves that it is a _right_ action by the amount of pleasure that goes with it: and yet that Nihilist, with his bowels of Christian dogmatism, regarded pleasure as an _objection_....",
    "What destroys a man more quickly than to work, think and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire, without pleasure--as a mere automaton of duty?",

    "Kant became an idiot.--And such a man was the contemporary of Goethe!",
    "This calamitous spinner of cobwebs passed for _the_ German philosopher--still passes today!...",
    "I forbid myself to say what I think of the Germans.... Didn't Kant see in the French Revolution the transformation of the state from the inorganic form to the _organic_?",
    "Didn't he ask himself if there was a single event that could be explained save on the assumption of a moral faculty in man, so that on the basis of it, \"the tendency of mankind toward the good\" could be _explained_, once and for all time?",

    "I put aside a few sceptics, the types of decency in the history of philosophy: the rest haven't the slightest conception of intellectual integrity.",
    "They behave like women, all these great enthusiasts and prodigies--they regard \"beautiful feelings\" as arguments, the \"heaving breast\" as the bellows of divine inspiration, conviction as the _criterion_ of truth.",
    "In the end, with \"German\" innocence, Kant tried to give a scientific flavour to this form of corruption, this dearth of intellectual conscience, by calling it \"practical reason.\"",
    "He deliberately invented a variety of reasons for use on occasions when it was desirable not to trouble with reason--that is, when morality, when the sublime command \"thou shalt,\" was heard.",
    "When one recalls the fact that, among all peoples, the philosopher is no more than a development from the old type of priest, this inheritance from the priest, this _fraud upon self_, ceases to be remarkable.",
    "When a man feels that he has a divine mission, say to lift up, to save or to liberate mankind--when a man feels the divine spark in his heart and believes that he is the mouthpiece of supernatural imperatives--when such a mission inflames him, it is only natural that he should stand beyond all merely reasonable standards of judgment.",
    "He feels that he is _himself_ sanctified by this mission, that he is himself a type of a higher order!...",
    "What has a priest to do with philosophy!",
    "He stands far above it!--And hitherto the priest has _ruled_!--He has determined the meaning of \"true\" and \"not true\"!...",
    "13. Let us not underestimate this fact: that _we ourselves_, we free spirits, are already a \"transvaluation of all values,\" a _visualized_ declaration of war and victory against all the old concepts of \"true\" and \"not true.\"",
    "The most valuable intuitions are the last to be attained; the most valuable of all are those which determine _methods_.",
    "All the methods, all the principles of the scientific spirit of today, were the targets for thousands of years of the most profound contempt; if a man inclined to them he was excluded from the society of \"decent\" people--he passed as \"an enemy of God,\" as a scoffer at the truth, as one \"possessed.\"",
    "As a man of science, he belonged to the Chandala[2]....",
    "We have had the whole pathetic stupidity of mankind against us--their every notion of what the truth _ought_ to be, of what the service of the truth _ought_ to be--their every \"thou shalt\" was launched against us....",
    "Our objectives, our methods, our quiet, cautious, distrustful manner--all appeared to them as absolutely discreditable and contemptible.--Looking back, one may almost ask one's self with reason if it was not actually an _aesthetic_ sense that kept men blind so long: what they demanded of the truth was picturesque effectiveness, and of the learned a strong appeal to their senses.",

    "We regard him as the strongest of the beasts because he is the craftiest; one of the results thereof is his intellectuality.",
    "On the other hand, we guard ourselves against a conceit which would assert itself even here: that man is the great second thought in the process of organic evolution.",
    "He is, in truth, anything but the crown of creation: beside him stand many other animals, all at similar stages of development....",
    "And even when we say that we say a bit too much, for man, relatively speaking, is the most botched of all the animals and the sickliest, and he has wandered the most dangerously from his instincts--though for all that, to be sure, he remains the most _interesting_!--As regards the lower animals, it was Descartes who first had the really admirable daring to describe them as _machina_; the whole of our physiology is directed toward proving the truth of this doctrine.",
    "Moreover, it is illogical to set man apart, as Descartes did: what we know of man today is limited precisely by the extent to which we have regarded him, too, as a machine.",
    "Formerly we accorded to man, as his inheritance from some higher order of beings, what was called \"free will\"; now we have taken even this will from him, for the term no longer describes anything that we can understand.",
    "The old word \"will\" now connotes only a sort of result, an individual reaction, that follows inevitably upon a series of partly discordant and partly harmonious stimuli--the will no longer \"acts,\" or \"moves.",
    "\"... Formerly it was thought that man's consciousness, his \"spirit,\" offered evidence of his high origin, his divinity.",
    "That he might be _perfected_, he was advised, tortoise-like, to draw his senses in, to have no traffic with earthly things, to shuffle off his mortal coil--then only the important part of him, the \"pure spirit,\" would remain.",
    "Here again we have thought out the thing better: to us consciousness, or \"the spirit,\" appears as a symptom of a relative imperfection of the organism, as an experiment, a groping, a misunderstanding, as an affliction which uses up nervous force unnecessarily--we deny that anything can be done perfectly so long as it is done consciously.",
    "The \"pure spirit\" is a piece of pure stupidity: take away the nervous system and the senses, the so-called \"mortal shell,\" and _the rest is miscalculation_--that is all!...",

    "Under Christianity neither morality nor religion has any point of contact with actuality.",
    "It offers purely imaginary _causes_ (\"God,\" \"soul,\" \"ego,\" \"spirit,\" \"free will\"--or even \"unfree\"), and purely imaginary _effects_ (\"sin,\" \"salvation,\" \"grace,\" \"punishment,\" \"forgiveness of sins\").",
    "Intercourse between imaginary _beings_ (\"God,\" \"spirits,\" \"souls\"); an imaginary _natural history_ (anthropocentric; a total denial of the concept of natural causes); an imaginary _psychology_ (misunderstandings of self, misinterpretations of agreeable or disagreeable general feelings--for example, of the states of the _nervus sympathicus_ with the help of the sign-language of religio-ethical balderdash--, \"repentance,\" \"pangs of conscience,\" \"temptation by the devil,\" \"the presence of God\"); an imaginary _teleology_ (the \"kingdom of God,\" \"the last judgment,\" \"eternal life\").--This purely _fictitious world_, greatly to its disadvantage, is to be differentiated from the world of dreams; the latter at least reflects reality, whereas the former falsifies it, cheapens it and denies it.",
    "Once the concept of \"nature\" had been opposed to the concept of \"God,\" the word \"natural\" necessarily took on the meaning of \"abominable\"--the whole of that fictitious world has its sources in hatred of the natural (--the real!--), and is no more than evidence of a profound uneasiness in the presence of reality.... _",

    "A criticism of the _Christian concept of God_ leads inevitably to the same conclusion.--A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to its own god.",
    "In him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to survive, to its virtues--it projects its joy in itself, its feeling of power, into a being to whom one may offer thanks.",
    "He who is rich will give of his riches; a proud people need a god to whom they can make _sacrifices_....",
    "Religion, within these limits, is a form of gratitude.",
    "A man is grateful for his own existence: to that end he needs a god.--Such a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries; he must be able to play either friend or foe--he is wondered at for the good he does as well as for the evil he does.",
    "But the castration, against all nature, of such a god, making him a god of goodness alone, would be contrary to human inclination.",
    "Mankind has just as much need for an evil god as for a good god; it doesn't have to thank mere tolerance and humanitarianism for its own existence....",

    "who had perhaps never experienced the rapturous _ardeurs_ of victory and of destruction?",
    "No one would understand such a god: why should any one want him?--True enough, when a nation is on the downward path, when it feels its belief in its own future, its hope of freedom slipping from it, when it begins to see submission as a first necessity and the virtues of submission as measures of self-preservation, then it _must_ overhaul its god.",
    "He then becomes a hypocrite, timorous and demure; he counsels \"peace of soul,\" hate-no-more, leniency, \"love\" of friend and foe.",

    "The Brahmins knew it, Plato knew it, every student of the esoteric knows it.",
    "When, for example, a man gets any _pleasure_ out of the notion that he has been saved from sin, it is _not_ necessary for him to be actually sinful, but merely to _feel_ sinful.",
    "But when _faith_ is thus exalted above everything else, it necessarily follows that reason, knowledge and patient inquiry have to be discredited: the road to the truth becomes a forbidden road.--Hope, in its stronger forms, is a great deal more powerful _stimulans_ to life than any sort of realized joy can ever be.",
    "Man must be sustained in suffering by a hope so high that no conflict with actuality can dash it--so high, indeed, that no fulfilment can _satisfy_ it: a hope reaching out beyond this world.",
    "(Precisely because of this power that hope has of making the suffering hold out, the Greeks regarded it as the evil of evils, as the most _malign_ of evils; it remained behind at the source of all evil.)[3]--In order that _love_ may be possible, God must become a person; in order that the lower instincts may take a hand in the matter God must be young.",

    "They put themselves _against_ all those conditions under which, hitherto, a people had been able to live, or had even been _permitted_ to live; out of themselves they evolved an idea which stood in direct opposition to _natural_ conditions--one by one they distorted religion, civilization, morality, history and psychology until each became a _contradiction_ of its _natural significance_.",
    "We meet with the same phenomenon later on, in an incalculably exaggerated form, but only as a copy: the Christian church, put beside the \"people of God,\" shows a complete lack of any claim to originality.",
    "Precisely for this reason the Jews are the most _fateful_ people in the history of the world: their influence has so falsified the reasoning of mankind in this matter that today the Christian can cherish anti-Semitism without realizing that it is no more than the _final consequence of Judaism_.",

    "In order to be able to say Nay to everything representing an _ascending_ evolution of life--that is, to well-being, to power, to beauty, to self-approval--the instincts of _ressentiment_, here become downright genius, had to invent an _other_ world in which the _acceptance of life_ appeared as the most evil and abominable thing imaginable.",
    "Psychologically, the Jews are a people gifted with the very strongest vitality, so much so that when they found themselves facing impossible conditions of life they chose voluntarily, and with a profound talent for self-preservation, the side of all those instincts which make for _decadence_--_not_ as if mastered by them, but as if detecting in them a power by which \"the world\" could be _defied_.",
    "The Jews are the very opposite of _decadents_: they have simply been forced into _appearing_ in that guise, and with a degree of skill approaching the _non plus ultra_ of histrionic genius they have managed to put themselves at the head of all _decadent_ movements (--for example, the Christianity of Paul--), and so make of them something stronger than any party frankly saying _",

    "But the people still retained, as a projection of their highest yearnings, that vision of a king who was at once a gallant warrior and an upright judge--a vision best visualized in the typical prophet (_i. e._, critic and satirist of the moment), Isaiah.--But every hope remained unfulfilled.",
    "The old god no longer _could_ do what he used to do.",

    "But the \"will of God\" had already been revealed to Moses....",
    "What happened?",
    "Simply this: the priest had formulated, once and for all time and with the strictest meticulousness, what tithes were to be paid to him, from the largest to the smallest (--not forgetting the most appetizing cuts of meat, for the priest is a great consumer of beefsteaks); in brief, he let it be known just _what he wanted_, what \"the will of God\" was....",
    "From this time forward things were so arranged that the priest became _indispensable everywhere_; at all the great natural events of life, at birth, at marriage, in sickness, at death, not to say at the \"_sacrifice_\"",
    "(that is, at meal-times), the holy parasite put in his appearance, and proceeded to _denaturize_ it--in his own phrase, to \"sanctify\" it....",
    "For this should be noted: that every natural habit, every natural institution (the state, the administration of justice, marriage, the care of the sick and of the poor), everything demanded by the life-instinct, in short, everything that has any value _in itself_, is reduced to absolute worthlessness and even made the _reverse_ of valuable by the parasitism of priests (or, if you chose, by the \"moral order of the world\").",
    "The fact requires a sanction--a power to _grant values_ becomes necessary, and the only way it can create such values is by denying nature....",
    "The priest depreciates and desecrates nature: it is only at this price that he can exist at all.--Disobedience to God, which actually means to the priest, to \"the law,\" now gets the name of \"sin\"; the means prescribed for \"reconciliation with God\" are, of course, precisely the means which bring one most effectively under the thumb of the priest; he alone can \"save\"....",

    "it actually denied even the last form of reality, the \"holy people,\" the \"chosen people,\" _Jewish_ reality itself.",
    "The phenomenon is of the first order of importance: the small insurrectionary movement which took the name of Jesus of Nazareth is simply the Jewish instinct _redivivus_--in other words, it is the priestly instinct come to such a pass that it can no longer endure the priest as a fact; it is the discovery of a state of existence even more fantastic than any before it, of a vision of life even more _unreal_ than that necessary to an ecclesiastical organization.",
    "Christianity actually _denies_ the church....",

    "That strange and sickly world into which the Gospels lead us--a world apparently out of a Russian novel, in which the scum of society, nervous maladies and \"childish\" idiocy keep a tryst--must, in any case, have _coarsened_ the type: the first disciples, in particular, must have been forced to translate an existence visible only in symbols and incomprehensibilities into their own crudity, in order to understand it at all--in their sight the type could take on reality only after it had been recast in a familiar mould....",

    "In point of fact, the end for which one lies makes a great difference: whether one preserves thereby or destroys.",
    "There is a perfect likeness between Christian and anarchist: their object, their instinct, points only toward destruction.",
    "One need only turn to history for a proof of this: there it appears with appalling distinctness.",
    "We have just studied a code of religious legislation whose object it was to convert the conditions which cause life to _flourish_ into an \"eternal\" social organization,--Christianity found its mission in putting an end to such an organization, _because life flourished under it_.",
    "There the benefits that reason had produced during long ages of experiment and insecurity were applied to the most remote uses, and an effort was made to bring in a harvest that should be as large, as rich and as complete as possible; here, on the contrary, the harvest is _blighted_ overnight....",
    "That which stood there _aere perennis_, the _imperium Romanum_, the most magnificent form of organization under difficult conditions that has ever been achieved, and compared to which everything before it and after it appears as patchwork, bungling, _dilletantism_--those holy anarchists made it a matter of \"piety\" to destroy \"the world,\" _which is to say_, the _imperium Romanum_, so that in the end not a stone stood upon another--and even Germans and other such louts were able to become its masters....",
    "The Christian and the anarchist: both are _decadents_; both are incapable of any act that is not disintegrating, poisonous, degenerating, _blood-sucking_; both have an instinct of _mortal hatred_ of everything that stands up, and is great, and has durability, and promises life a future....",
    "Christianity was the vampire of the _imperium Romanum_,--overnight it destroyed the vast achievement of the Romans: the conquest of the soil for a great culture _that could await its time_.",
    "Can it be that this fact is not yet understood?",
    "The _imperium Romanum_ that we know, and that the history of the Roman provinces teaches us to know better and better,--this most admirable of all works of art in the grand manner was merely the beginning, and the structure to follow was not to _prove_ its worth for thousands of years.",
    "To this day, nothing on a like scale _sub specie aeterni_ has been brought into being, or even dreamed of!--This organization was strong enough to withstand bad emperors: the accident of personality has nothing to do with such things--the _first_ principle of all genuinely great architecture.",
    "But it was not strong enough to stand up against the _corruptest_ of all forms of corruption--against Christians....",
    "These stealthy worms, which under the cover of night, mist and duplicity, crept upon every individual, sucking him dry of all earnest interest in _real_ things, of all instinct for _reality_--this cowardly, effeminate and sugar-coated gang gradually alienated all \"souls,\" step by step, from that colossal edifice, turning against it all the meritorious, manly and noble natures that had found in the cause of Rome their own cause, their own serious purpose, their own _pride_.",
    "The sneakishness of hypocrisy, the secrecy of the conventicle, concepts as black as hell, such as the sacrifice of the innocent, the _unio mystica_ in the drinking of blood, above all, the slowly rekindled fire of revenge, of Chandala revenge--all _that_ sort of thing became master of Rome: the same kind of religion which, in a pre-existent form, Epicurus had combatted.",
    "One has but to read Lucretius to know _what_",
    "Epicurus made war upon--_not_ paganism, but \"Christianity,\" which is to say, the corruption of souls by means of the concepts of guilt, punishment and immortality.--He combatted the _subterranean_ cults, the whole of latent Christianity--to deny immortality was already a form of genuine _salvation_.--Epicurus had triumphed, and every respectable intellect in Rome was Epicurean--_when Paul appeared_ ...",
    "Paul, the Chandala hatred of Rome, of \"the world,\" in the flesh and inspired by genius--the Jew, the _eternal_ Jew _par excellence_....",
    "What he saw was how, with the aid of the small sectarian Christian movement that stood apart from Judaism, a \"world conflagration\" might be kindled; how, with the symbol of \"God on the cross,\" all secret seditions, all the fruits of anarchistic intrigues in the empire, might be amalgamated into one immense power.",
    "\"Salvation is of the Jews.",
    "\"--Christianity is the formula for exceeding _and_ summing up the subterranean cults of all varieties, that of Osiris, that of the Great Mother, that of Mithras, for instance: in his discernment of this fact the genius of Paul showed itself.",
    "His instinct was here so sure that, with reckless violence to the truth, he put the ideas which lent fascination to every sort of Chandala religion into the mouth of the \"Saviour\" as his own inventions, and not only into the mouth--he _made_ out of him something that even a priest of Mithras could understand....",
    "This was his revelation at Damascus: he grasped the fact that he _needed_",
    "the belief in immortality in order to rob \"the world\" of its value, that the concept of \"hell\" would master Rome--that the notion of a \"beyond\" is the _death of life_....",
    "Nihilist and Christian: they rhyme in German, and they do more than rhyme....",
    "59.",
    "The whole labour of the ancient world gone for _naught_:",
    "I have no word to describe the feelings that such an enormity arouses in me.--And, considering the fact that its labour was merely preparatory, that with adamantine self-consciousness it laid only the foundations for a work to go on for thousands of years, the whole _meaning_ of antiquity disappears!...",
    "To what end the Greeks?",
    "to what end the Romans?--All the prerequisites to a learned culture, all the _methods_ of science, were already there; man had already perfected the great and incomparable art of reading profitably--that first necessity to the tradition of culture, the unity of the sciences; the natural sciences, in alliance with mathematics and mechanics, were on the right road,--_the sense of fact_, the last and more valuable of all the senses, had its schools, and its traditions were already centuries old!",
    "Is all this properly understood?",
    "Every _essential_ to the beginning of the work was ready:--and the _most_ essential, it cannot be said too often, are methods, and also the most difficult to develop, and the longest opposed by habit and laziness.",
    "What we have today reconquered, with unspeakable self-discipline, for ourselves--for certain bad instincts, certain Christian instincts, still lurk in our bodies--that is to say, the keen eye for reality, the cautious hand, patience and seriousness in the smallest things, the whole _integrity_ of knowledge--all these things were already there, and had been there for two thousand years!",

    "But as body, as bearing, as instinct--in short, as reality.... _All gone for naught!_",
    "Overnight it became merely a memory!--The Greeks!",
    "The Romans!",
    "Instinctive nobility, taste, methodical inquiry, genius for organization and administration, faith in and the _will_ to secure the future of man, a great yes to everything entering into the _imperium Romanum_ and palpable to all the senses, a grand style that was beyond mere art, but had become reality, truth, _",
    "life_....--All overwhelmed in a night, but not by a convulsion of nature!",
    "Not trampled to death by Teutons and others of heavy hoof!",
    "But brought to shame by crafty, sneaking, invisible, anaemic vampires!",
    "Not conquered,--only sucked dry!...",
    "Hidden vengefulness, petty envy, became _master_!",
    "Everything wretched, intrinsically ailing, and invaded by bad feelings, the whole _ghetto-world_ of the soul, was at once _on top_!--One needs but read any of the Christian agitators, for example, St. Augustine, in order to realize, in order to smell, what filthy fellows came to the top.",
    "It would be an error, however, to assume that there was any lack of understanding in the leaders of the Christian movement:--ah, but they were clever, clever to the point of holiness, these fathers of the church!",
    "What they lacked was something quite different.",
    "Nature neglected--perhaps forgot--to give them even the most modest endowment of respectable, of upright, of _cleanly_ instincts....",

    "The wonderful culture of the Moors in Spain, which was fundamentally nearer to _us_ and appealed more to our senses and tastes than that of Rome and Greece, was _trampled down_ (--I do not say by what sort of feet--)",
    "Why?",
    "Because it had to thank noble and manly instincts for its origin--because it said yes to life, even to the rare and refined luxuriousness of Moorish life!...",
    "The crusaders later made war on something before which it would have been more fitting for them to have grovelled in the dust--a civilization beside which even that of our nineteenth century seems very poor and very \"senile.",
    "\"--What they wanted, of course, was booty: the orient was rich....",
    "Let us put aside our prejudices!",
    "The crusades were a higher form of piracy, nothing more!",
    "The German nobility, which is fundamentally a Viking nobility, was in its element there: the church knew only too well how the German nobility was to be _won_....",
    "The German noble, always the \"Swiss guard\" of the church, always in the service of every bad instinct of the church--_but well paid_....",
    "Consider the fact that it is precisely the aid of German swords and German blood and valour that has enabled the church to carry through its war to the death upon everything noble on earth!",
    "At this point a host of painful questions suggest themselves.",

    "Is it understood at last, _will_ it ever be understood, _what_ the Renaissance was?",
    "_",
    "The transvaluation of Christian values_,--an attempt with all available means, all instincts and all the resources of genius to bring about a triumph of the _opposite_ values, the more _noble_ values....",
    "This has been the one great war of the past; there has never been a more critical question than that of the Renaissance--it is _my_ question too--; there has never been a form of _attack_ more fundamental, more direct, or more violently delivered by a whole front upon the center of the enemy!",
    "To attack at the critical place, at the very seat of Christianity, and there enthrone the more noble values--that is to say, to _insinuate_ them into the instincts, into the most fundamental needs and appetites of those sitting there ...",
    "I see before me the _possibility_ of a perfectly heavenly enchantment and spectacle:--it seems to me to scintillate with all the vibrations of a fine and delicate beauty, and within it there is an art so divine, so infernally divine, that one might search in vain for thousands of years for another such possibility; I see a spectacle so rich in significance and at the same time so wonderfully full of paradox that it should arouse all the gods on Olympus to immortal laughter--_Caesar Borgia as pope!_...",
    "Am I understood?...",
    "Well then, _that_ would have been the sort of triumph that _",
    "I_ alone am longing for today--: by it Christianity would have been _swept away_!--What happened?",
    "A German monk, Luther, came to Rome.",
    "This monk, with all the vengeful instincts of an unsuccessful priest in him, raised a rebellion _against_ the Renaissance in Rome....",
    "Instead of grasping, with profound thanksgiving, the miracle that had taken place: the conquest of Christianity at its _capital_--instead of this, his hatred was stimulated by the spectacle.",
    "A religious man thinks only of himself.--Luther saw only the _depravity_ of the papacy at the very moment when the opposite was becoming apparent: the old corruption, the _peccatum originale_, Christianity itself, no longer occupied the papal chair!",
    "Instead there was life!",
    "Instead there was the triumph of life!",
    "Instead there was a great yea to all lofty, beautiful and daring things!...",
    "And Luther _restored the church_: he attacked it....",
    "The Renaissance--an event without meaning, a great futility!--Ah, these Germans, what they have not cost us!",
    "_Futility_--that has always been the work of the Germans.--The Reformation; Leibnitz; Kant and so-called German philosophy; the war of \"liberation\"; the empire--every time a futile substitute for something that once existed, for something _irrecoverable_....",
    "These Germans, I confess, are my enemies: I despise all their uncleanliness in concept and valuation, their cowardice before every honest yea and nay.",
    "For nearly a thousand years they have tangled and confused everything their fingers have touched; they have on their conscience all the half-way measures, all the three-eighths-way measures, that Europe is sick of,--they also have on their conscience the uncleanest variety of Christianity that exists, and the most incurable and indestructible--Protestantism....",

    "It is, to me, the greatest of all imaginable corruptions; it seeks to work the ultimate corruption, the worst possible corruption.",
    "The Christian church has left nothing untouched by its depravity; it has turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and every integrity into baseness of soul.",
    "Let any one dare to speak to me of its \"humanitarian\" blessings!",
    "Its deepest necessities range it against any effort to abolish distress; it lives by distress; it _creates_ distress to make _itself_ immortal....",
    "For example, the worm of sin: it was the church that first enriched mankind with this misery!--The \"equality of souls before God\"--this fraud, this _pretext_ for the _rancunes_ of all the base-minded--this explosive concept, ending in revolution, the modern idea, and the notion of overthrowing the whole social order--this is _Christian_ dynamite....",
    "The \"humanitarian\" blessings of Christianity forsooth!",
    "To breed out of _humanitas_ a self-contradiction, an art of self-pollution, a will to lie at any price, an aversion and contempt for all good and honest instincts!",
    "All this, to me, is the \"humanitarianism\" of Christianity!--Parasitism as the _only_ practice of the church; with its anaemic and \"holy\" ideals, sucking all the blood, all the love, all the hope out of life; the beyond as the will to deny all reality; the cross as the distinguishing mark of the most subterranean conspiracy ever heard of,--against health, beauty, well-being, intellect, _kindness_ of soul--_against life itself_....",
    "This eternal accusation against Christianity I shall write upon all walls, wherever walls are to be found--I have letters that even the blind will be able to see....",
    "I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and _small_ enough,--I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race....",
    "And mankind reckons _time_ from the _dies nefastus_ when this fatality befell--from the _first_ day of Christianity!--_Why not rather from its last?_--_From today?_--The transvaluation of all values!...",

    "INTRODUCTION BY MRS FORSTER-NIETZSCHE.",
    "HOW ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING.",
    "“Zarathustra” is my brother’s most personal work; it is the history of his most individual experiences, of his friendships, ideals, raptures, bitterest disappointments and sorrows.",
    "Above it all, however, there soars, transfiguring it, the image of his greatest hopes and remotest aims.",
    "My brother had the figure of Zarathustra in his mind from his very earliest youth: he once told me that even as a child he had dreamt of him.",
    "At different periods in his life, he would call this haunter of his dreams by different names; “but in the end,” he declares in a note on the subject, “I had to do a PERSIAN the honour of identifying him with this creature of my fancy.",
    "Persians were the first to take a broad and comprehensive view of history.",
    "Every series of evolutions, according to them, was presided over by a prophet; and every prophet had his ‘Hazar,’—his dynasty of a thousand years.”",
    "All Zarathustra’s views, as also his personality, were early conceptions of my brother’s mind.",
    "Whoever reads his posthumously published writings for the years 1869–82 with care, will constantly meet with passages suggestive of Zarathustra’s thoughts and doctrines.",
    "For instance, the ideal of the Superman is put forth quite clearly in all his writings during the years 1873–75; and in “We Philologists”, the following remarkable observations occur:— “How can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole?—Even among the Greeks, it was the INDIVIDUALS that counted.”",
    "“The Greeks are interesting and extremely important because they reared such a vast number of great individuals.",
    "How was this possible?",
    "The question is one which ought to be studied.",
    "“I am interested only in the relations of a people to the rearing of the individual man, and among the Greeks the conditions were unusually favourable for the development of the individual; not by any means owing to the goodness of the people, but because of the struggles of their evil instincts.",
    "“WITH THE HELP OF FAVOURABLE MEASURES GREAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE REARED WHO WOULD BE BOTH DIFFERENT FROM AND HIGHER THAN THOSE WHO HERETOFORE HAVE OWED THEIR EXISTENCE TO MERE CHANCE.",
    "Here we may still be hopeful: in the rearing of exceptional men.”",
    "The notion of rearing the Superman is only a new form of an ideal Nietzsche already had in his youth, that “THE OBJECT OF MANKIND SHOULD LIE IN ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS” (or, as he writes in “Schopenhauer as Educator”: “Mankind ought constantly to be striving to produce great men—this and nothing else is its duty.”)",
    "But the ideals he most revered in those days are no longer held to be the highest types of men.",
    "No, around this future ideal of a coming humanity—the Superman—the poet spread the veil of becoming.",
    "Who can tell to what glorious heights man can still ascend?",
    "That is why, after having tested the worth of our noblest ideal—that of the Saviour, in the light of the new valuations, the poet cries with passionate emphasis in “Zarathustra”: “Never yet hath there been a Superman.",
    "Naked have I seen both of them, the greatest and the smallest man:— All-too-similar are they still to each other.",
    "Verily even the greatest found I—all-too-human!”",
    "— The phrase “the rearing of the Superman,” has very often been misunderstood.",
    "By the word “rearing,” in this case, is meant the act of modifying by means of new and higher values—values which, as laws and guides of conduct and opinion, are now to rule over mankind.",
    "In general the doctrine of the Superman can only be understood correctly in conjunction with other ideas of the author’s, such as:—the Order of Rank, the Will to Power, and the Transvaluation of all Values.",
    "He assumes that Christianity, as a product of the resentment of the botched and the weak, has put in ban all that is beautiful, strong, proud, and powerful, in fact all the qualities resulting from strength, and that, in consequence, all forces which tend to promote or elevate life have been seriously undermined.",
    "Now, however, a new table of valuations must be placed over mankind—namely, that of the strong, mighty, and magnificent man, overflowing with life and elevated to his zenith—the Superman, who is now put before us with overpowering passion as the aim of our life, hope, and will.",
    "And just as the old system of valuing, which only extolled the qualities favourable to the weak, the suffering, and the oppressed, has succeeded in producing a weak, suffering, and “modern” race, so this new and reversed system of valuing ought to rear a healthy, strong, lively, and courageous type, which would be a glory to life itself.",
    "Stated briefly, the leading principle of this new system of valuing would be: “All that proceeds from power is good, all that springs from weakness is bad.”",
    "This type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure: it is not a nebulous hope which is to be realised at some indefinitely remote period, thousands of years hence; nor is it a new species (in the Darwinian sense) of which we can know nothing, and which it would therefore be somewhat absurd to strive after.",
    "But it is meant to be a possibility which men of the present could realise with all their spiritual and physical energies, provided they adopted the new values.",
    "The author of “Zarathustra” never lost sight of that egregious example of a transvaluation of all values through Christianity, whereby the whole of the deified mode of life and thought of the Greeks, as well as strong Romedom, was almost annihilated or transvalued in a comparatively short time.",
    "Could not a rejuvenated Graeco-Roman system of valuing (once it had been refined and made more profound by the schooling which two thousand years of Christianity had provided) effect another such revolution within a calculable period of time, until that glorious type of manhood shall finally appear which is to be our new faith and hope, and in the creation of which Zarathustra exhorts us to participate?",
    "In his private notes on the subject the author uses the expression “Superman” (always in the singular, by-the-bye), as signifying “the most thoroughly well-constituted type,” as opposed to “modern man”; above all, however, he designates Zarathustra himself as an example of the Superman.",
    "In “Ecco Homo” he is careful to enlighten us concerning the precursors and prerequisites to the advent of this highest type, in referring to a certain passage in the “Gay Science”:— “In order to understand this type, we must first be quite clear in regard to the leading physiological condition on which it depends: this condition is what I call GREAT HEALTHINESS.",
    "I know not how to express my meaning more plainly or more personally than I have done already in one of the last chapters (Aphorism 382) of the fifth book of the ‘Gaya Scienza’.”",
    "“We, the new, the nameless, the hard-to-understand,”—it says there,—“we firstlings of a yet untried future—we require for a new end also a new means, namely, a new healthiness, stronger, sharper, tougher, bolder and merrier than all healthiness hitherto.",
    "He whose soul longeth to experience the whole range of hitherto recognised values and desirabilities, and to circumnavigate all the coasts of this ideal ‘Mediterranean Sea’, who, from the adventures of his most personal experience, wants to know how it feels to be a conqueror, and discoverer of the ideal—as likewise how it is with the artist, the saint, the legislator, the sage, the scholar, the devotee, the prophet, and the godly non-conformist of the old style:—requires one thing above all for that purpose, GREAT HEALTHINESS—such healthiness as one not only possesses, but also constantly acquires and must acquire, because one unceasingly sacrifices it again, and must sacrifice it!—And now, after having been long on the way in this fashion, we Argonauts of the ideal, more courageous perhaps than prudent, and often enough shipwrecked and brought to grief, nevertheless dangerously healthy, always healthy again,—it would seem as if, in recompense for it all, that we have a still undiscovered country before us, the boundaries of which no one has yet seen, a beyond to all countries and corners of the ideal known hitherto, a world so over-rich in the beautiful, the strange, the questionable, the frightful, and the divine, that our curiosity as well as our thirst for possession thereof, have got out of hand—alas!",
    "that nothing will now any longer satisfy us!—",
    "“How could we still be content with THE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY after such outlooks, and with such a craving in our conscience and consciousness?",
    "Sad enough; but it is unavoidable that we should look on the worthiest aims and hopes of the man of the present-day with ill-concealed amusement, and perhaps should no longer look at them.",
    "Another ideal runs on before us, a strange, tempting ideal full of danger, to which we should not like to persuade any one, because we do not so readily acknowledge any one’s RIGHT THERETO: the ideal of a spirit who plays naively (that is to say involuntarily and from overflowing abundance and power) with everything that has hitherto been called holy, good, intangible, or divine; to whom the loftiest conception which the people have reasonably made their measure of value, would already practically imply danger, ruin, abasement, or at least relaxation, blindness, or temporary self-forgetfulness; the ideal of a humanly superhuman welfare and benevolence, which will often enough appear INHUMAN, for example, when put alongside of all past seriousness on earth, and alongside of all past solemnities in bearing, word, tone, look, morality, and pursuit, as their truest involuntary parody—and WITH which, nevertheless, perhaps THE GREAT SERIOUSNESS only commences, when the proper interrogative mark is set up, the fate of the soul changes, the hour-hand moves, and tragedy begins...”",
    "Although the figure of Zarathustra and a large number of the leading thoughts in this work had appeared much earlier in the dreams and writings of the author, “Thus Spake Zarathustra” did not actually come into being until the month of August 1881 in Sils Maria; and it was the idea of the Eternal Recurrence of all things which finally induced my brother to set forth his new views in poetic language.",
    "In regard to his first conception of this idea, his autobiographical sketch, “Ecce Homo”, written in the autumn of 1888, contains the following passage:— “The fundamental idea of my work—namely, the Eternal Recurrence of all things—this highest of all possible formulae of a Yea-saying philosophy, first occurred to me in August 1881.",
    "I made a note of the thought on a sheet of paper, with the postscript: 6,000 feet beyond men and time!",
    "That day I happened to be wandering through the woods alongside of the lake of Silvaplana, and I halted beside a huge, pyramidal and towering rock not far from Surlei.",
    "It was then that the thought struck me.",
    "Looking back now, I find that exactly two months previous to this inspiration, I had had an omen of its coming in the form of a sudden and decisive alteration in my tastes—more particularly in music.",
    "It would even be possible to consider all ‘Zarathustra’ as a musical composition.",
    "At all events, a very necessary condition in its production was a renaissance in myself of the art of hearing.",
    "In a small mountain resort (Recoaro) near Vicenza, where I spent the spring of 1881, I and my friend and Maestro, Peter Gast—also one who had been born again—discovered that the phoenix music that hovered over us, wore lighter and brighter plumes than it had done theretofore.”",
    "During the month of August 1881 my brother resolved to reveal the teaching of the Eternal Recurrence, in dithyrambic and psalmodic form, through the mouth of Zarathustra.",
    "Among the notes of this period, we found a page on which is written the first definite plan of “Thus Spake Zarathustra”:— “MIDDAY AND ETERNITY.”",
    "“GUIDE-POSTS TO A NEW WAY OF LIVING.”",
    "Beneath this is written:— “Zarathustra born on lake Urmi; left his home in his thirtieth year, went into the province of Aria, and, during ten years of solitude in the mountains, composed the Zend-Avesta.”",
    "“The sun of knowledge stands once more at midday; and the serpent of eternity lies coiled in its light—: It is YOUR time, ye midday brethren.”",
    "In that summer of 1881, my brother, after many years of steadily declining health, began at last to rally, and it is to this first gush of the recovery of his once splendid bodily condition that we owe not only “The Gay Science”, which in its mood may be regarded as a prelude to “Zarathustra”, but also “Zarathustra” itself.",
    "Just as he was beginning to recuperate his health, however, an unkind destiny brought him a number of most painful personal experiences.",
    "His friends caused him many disappointments, which were the more bitter to him, inasmuch as he regarded friendship as such a sacred institution; and for the first time in his life he realised the whole horror of that loneliness to which, perhaps, all greatness is condemned.",
    "But to be forsaken is something very different from deliberately choosing blessed loneliness.",
    "How he longed, in those days, for the ideal friend who would thoroughly understand him, to whom he would be able to say all, and whom he imagined he had found at various periods in his life from his earliest youth onwards.",
    "Now, however, that the way he had chosen grew ever more perilous and steep, he found nobody who could follow him: he therefore created a perfect friend for himself in the ideal form of a majestic philosopher, and made this creation the preacher of his gospel to the world.",
    "Whether my brother would ever have written “Thus Spake Zarathustra” according to the first plan sketched in the summer of 1881, if he had not had the disappointments already referred to, is now an idle question; but perhaps where “Zarathustra” is concerned, we may also say with Master Eckhardt: “The fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is suffering.”",
    "My brother writes as follows about the origin of the first part of “Zarathustra”:—“In the winter of 1882–83, I was living on the charming little Gulf of Rapallo, not far from Genoa, and between Chiavari and Cape Porto Fino.",
    "My health was not very good; the winter was cold and exceptionally rainy; and the small inn in which I lived was so close to the water that at night my sleep would be disturbed if the sea were high.",
    "These circumstances were surely the very reverse of favourable; and yet in spite of it all, and as if in demonstration of my belief that everything decisive comes to life in spite of every obstacle, it was precisely during this winter and in the midst of these unfavourable circumstances that my ‘Zarathustra’ originated.",
    "In the morning I used to start out in a southerly direction up the glorious road to Zoagli, which rises aloft through a forest of pines and gives one a view far out into the sea.",
    "In the afternoon, as often as my health permitted, I walked round the whole bay from Santa Margherita to beyond Porto Fino.",
    "This spot was all the more interesting to me, inasmuch as it was so dearly loved by the Emperor Frederick III.",
    "In the autumn of 1886 I chanced to be there again when he was revisiting this small, forgotten world of happiness for the last time.",
    "It was on these two roads that all ‘Zarathustra’ came to me, above all Zarathustra himself as a type;—I ought rather to say that it was on these walks that these ideas waylaid me.”",
    "The first part of “Zarathustra” was written in about ten days—that is to say, from the beginning to about the middle of February 1883.",
    "“The last lines were written precisely in the hallowed hour when Richard Wagner gave up the ghost in Venice.”",
    "With the exception of the ten days occupied in composing the first part of this book, my brother often referred to this winter as the hardest and sickliest he had ever experienced.",
    "He did not, however, mean thereby that his former disorders were troubling him, but that he was suffering from a severe attack of influenza which he had caught in Santa Margherita, and which tormented him for several weeks after his arrival in Genoa.",
    "As a matter of fact, however, what he complained of most was his spiritual condition—that indescribable forsakenness—to which he gives such heartrending expression in “Zarathustra”.",
    "Even the reception which the first part met with at the hands of friends and acquaintances was extremely disheartening: for almost all those to whom he presented copies of the work misunderstood it.",
    "“I found no one ripe for many of my thoughts; the case of ‘Zarathustra’ proves that one can speak with the utmost clearness, and yet not be heard by any one.”",
    "My brother was very much discouraged by the feebleness of the response he was given, and as he was striving just then to give up the practice of taking hydrate of chloral—a drug he had begun to take while ill with influenza,—the following spring, spent in Rome, was a somewhat gloomy one for him.",
    "He writes about it as follows:—“I spent a melancholy spring in Rome, where I only just managed to live,—and this was no easy matter.",
    "This city, which is absolutely unsuited to the poet-author of ‘Zarathustra’, and for the choice of which I was not responsible, made me inordinately miserable.",
    "I tried to leave it.",
    "I wanted to go to Aquila—the opposite of Rome in every respect, and actually founded in a spirit of enmity towards that city (just as I also shall found a city some day), as a memento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the Church—a person very closely related to me,—the great Hohenstaufen, the Emperor Frederick II.",
    "But Fate lay behind it all: I had to return again to Rome.",
    "In the end I was obliged to be satisfied with the Piazza Barberini, after I had exerted myself in vain to find an anti-Christian quarter.",
    "I fear that on one occasion, to avoid bad smells as much as possible, I actually inquired at the Palazzo del Quirinale whether they could not provide a quiet room for a philosopher.",
    "In a chamber high above the Piazza just mentioned, from which one obtained a general view of Rome and could hear the fountains plashing far below, the loneliest of all songs was composed—‘The Night-Song’.",
    "About this time I was obsessed by an unspeakably sad melody, the refrain of which I recognised in the words, ‘dead through immortality.’”",
    "We remained somewhat too long in Rome that spring, and what with the effect of the increasing heat and the discouraging circumstances already described, my brother resolved not to write any more, or in any case, not to proceed with “Zarathustra”, although I offered to relieve him of all trouble in connection with the proofs and the publisher.",
    "When, however, we returned to Switzerland towards the end of June, and he found himself once more in the familiar and exhilarating air of the mountains, all his joyous creative powers revived, and in a note to me announcing the dispatch of some manuscript, he wrote as follows: “I have engaged a place here for three months: forsooth, I am the greatest fool to allow my courage to be sapped from me by the climate of Italy.",
    "Now and again I am troubled by the thought: WHAT NEXT?",
    "My ‘future’ is the darkest thing in the world to me, but as there still remains a great deal for me to do, I suppose I ought rather to think of doing this than of my future, and leave the rest to THEE and the gods.”",
    "The second part of “Zarathustra” was written between the 26th of June and the 6th July.",
    "“This summer, finding myself once more in the sacred place where the first thought of ‘Zarathustra’ flashed across my mind, I conceived the second part.",
    "Ten days sufficed.",
    "Neither for the second, the first, nor the third part, have I required a day longer.”",
    "He often used to speak of the ecstatic mood in which he wrote “Zarathustra”; how in his walks over hill and dale the ideas would crowd into his mind, and how he would note them down hastily in a note-book from which he would transcribe them on his return, sometimes working till midnight.",
    "He says in a letter to me: “You can have no idea of the vehemence of such composition,” and in “Ecce Homo” (autumn 1888)",
    "he describes as follows with passionate enthusiasm the incomparable mood in which he created Zarathustra:— “—Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration?",
    "If not, I will describe it.",
    "If one had the smallest vestige of superstition in one, it would hardly be possible to set aside completely the idea that one is the mere incarnation, mouthpiece or medium of an almighty power.",
    "The idea of revelation in the sense that something becomes suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy, which profoundly convulses and upsets one—describes simply the matter of fact.",
    "One hears—one does not seek; one takes—one does not ask who gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes with necessity, unhesitatingly—I have never had any choice in the matter.",
    "There is an ecstasy such that the immense strain of it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears, along with which one’s steps either rush or involuntarily lag, alternately.",
    "There is the feeling that one is completely out of hand, with the very distinct consciousness of an endless number of fine thrills and quiverings to the very toes;—there is a depth of happiness in which the painfullest and gloomiest do not operate as antitheses, but as conditioned, as demanded in the sense of necessary shades of colour in such an overflow of light.",
    "There is an instinct for rhythmic relations which embraces wide areas of forms (length, the need of a wide-embracing rhythm, is almost the measure of the force of an inspiration, a sort of counterpart to its pressure and tension).",
    "Everything happens quite involuntarily, as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom, of absoluteness, of power and divinity.",
    "The involuntariness of the figures and similes is the most remarkable thing; one loses all perception of what constitutes the figure and what constitutes the simile; everything seems to present itself as the readiest, the correctest and the simplest means of expression.",
    "It actually seems, to use one of Zarathustra’s own phrases, as if all things came unto one, and would fain be similes: ‘Here do all things come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee, for they want to ride upon thy back.",
    "On every simile dost thou here ride to every truth.",
    "Here fly open unto thee all being’s words and word-cabinets; here all being wanteth to become words, here all becoming wanteth to learn of thee how to talk.’",
    "This is MY experience of inspiration.",
    "I do not doubt but that one would have to go back thousands of years in order to find some one who could say to me: It is mine also!—”",
    "In the autumn of 1883 my brother left the Engadine for Germany and stayed there a few weeks.",
    "In the following winter, after wandering somewhat erratically through Stresa, Genoa, and Spezia, he landed in Nice, where the climate so happily promoted his creative powers that he wrote the third part of “Zarathustra”.",
    "“In the winter, beneath the halcyon sky of Nice, which then looked down upon me for the first time in my life, I found the third ‘Zarathustra’—and came to the end of my task; the whole having occupied me scarcely a year.",
    "Many hidden corners and heights in the landscapes round about Nice are hallowed to me by unforgettable moments.",
    "That decisive chapter entitled ‘Old and New Tables’ was composed in the very difficult ascent from the station to Eza—that wonderful Moorish village in the rocks.",
    "My most creative moments were always accompanied by unusual muscular activity.",
    "The body is inspired: let us waive the question of the ‘soul.’",
    "I might often have been seen dancing in those days.",
    "Without a suggestion of fatigue I could then walk for seven or eight hours on end among the hills.",
    "I slept well and laughed well—I was perfectly robust and patient.”",
    "As we have seen, each of the three parts of “Zarathustra” was written, after a more or less short period of preparation, in about ten days.",
    "The composition of the fourth part alone was broken by occasional interruptions.",
    "The first notes relating to this part were written while he and I were staying together in Zurich in September 1884.",
    "In the following November, while staying at Mentone, he began to elaborate these notes, and after a long pause, finished the manuscript at Nice between the end of January and the middle of February 1885.",
    "My brother then called this part the fourth and last; but even before, and shortly after it had been privately printed, he wrote to me saying that he still intended writing a fifth and sixth part, and notes relating to these parts are now in my possession.",
    "This fourth part (the original MS. of which contains this note: “Only for my friends, not for the public”) is written in a particularly personal spirit, and those few to whom he presented a copy of it, he pledged to the strictest secrecy concerning its contents.",
    "He often thought of making this fourth part public also, but doubted whether he would ever be able to do so without considerably altering certain portions of it.",
    "At all events he resolved to distribute this manuscript production, of which only forty copies were printed, only among those who had proved themselves worthy of it, and it speaks eloquently of his utter loneliness and need of sympathy in those days, that he had occasion to present only seven copies of his book according to this resolution.",
    "Already at the beginning of this history I hinted at the reasons which led my brother to select a Persian as the incarnation of his ideal of the majestic philosopher.",
    "His reasons, however, for choosing Zarathustra of all others to be his mouthpiece, he gives us in the following words:—“People have never asked me, as they should have done, what the name Zarathustra precisely means in my mouth, in the mouth of the first Immoralist; for what distinguishes that philosopher from all others in the past is the very fact that he was exactly the reverse of an immoralist.",
    "Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things.",
    "The translation of morality into the metaphysical, as force, cause, end in itself, was HIS work.",
    "But the very question suggests its own answer.",
    "Zarathustra CREATED the most portentous error, MORALITY, consequently he should also be the first to PERCEIVE that error, not only because he has had longer and greater experience of the subject than any other thinker—all history is the experimental refutation of the theory of the so-called moral order of things:—the more important point is that Zarathustra was more truthful than any other thinker.",
    "In his teaching alone do we meet with truthfulness upheld as the highest virtue—i.e.: the reverse of the COWARDICE of the ‘idealist’ who flees from reality.",
    "Zarathustra had more courage in his body than any other thinker before or after him.",
    "To tell the truth and TO AIM STRAIGHT: that is the first Persian virtue.",
    "Am I understood?...",
    "The overcoming of morality through itself—through truthfulness, the overcoming of the moralist through his opposite—THROUGH ME—: that is what the name Zarathustra means in my mouth.”",

    "1.",
    "When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his home, and went into the mountains.",
    "There he enjoyed his spirit and solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it.",
    "But at last his heart changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the sun, and spake thus unto it:",
    "Thou great star!",
    "What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest!",
    "For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine eagle, and my serpent.",
    "But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and blessed thee for it.",
    "Lo!",
    "I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.",
    "I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.",
    "Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the nether-world, thou exuberant star!",
    "Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.",
    "Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest happiness without envy!",
    "Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!",
    "Lo!",
    "This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again going to be a man.",
    "Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going.",
    "2. Zarathustra went down the mountain alone, no one meeting him.",
    "When he entered the forest, however, there suddenly stood before him an old man, who had left his holy cot to seek roots.",
    "And thus spake the old man to Zarathustra: “No stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed he by.",
    "Zarathustra he was called; but he hath altered.",
    "Then thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains: wilt thou now carry thy fire into the valleys?",
    "Fearest thou not the incendiary’s doom?",
    "Yea, I recognise Zarathustra.",
    "Pure is his eye, and no loathing lurketh about his mouth.",
    "Goeth he not along like a dancer?",
    "Altered is Zarathustra; a child hath Zarathustra become; an awakened one is Zarathustra: what wilt thou do in the land of the sleepers?",
    "As in the sea hast thou lived in solitude, and it hath borne thee up.",
    "Alas, wilt thou now go ashore?",
    "Alas, wilt thou again drag thy body thyself?”",
    "Zarathustra answered: “I love mankind.”",
    "“Why,” said the saint, “did I go into the forest and the desert?",
    "Was it not because I loved men far too well?",
    "Now I love God: men, I do not love.",
    "Man is a thing too imperfect for me.",
    "Love to man would be fatal to me.”",
    "Zarathustra answered: “What spake I of love!",
    "I am bringing gifts unto men.”",
    "“Give them nothing,” said the saint.",
    "“Take rather part of their load, and carry it along with them—that will be most agreeable unto them: if only it be agreeable unto thee!",
    "If, however, thou wilt give unto them, give them no more than an alms, and let them also beg for it!”",
    "“No,” replied Zarathustra, “I give no alms.",
    "I am not poor enough for that.”",
    "The saint laughed at Zarathustra, and spake thus: “Then see to it that they accept thy treasures!",
    "They are distrustful of anchorites, and do not believe that we come with gifts.",
    "The fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their streets.",
    "And just as at night, when they are in bed and hear a man abroad long before sunrise, so they ask themselves concerning us: Where goeth the thief?",
    "Go not to men, but stay in the forest!",
    "Go rather to the animals!",
    "Why not be like me—a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds?”",
    "“And what doeth the saint in the forest?” asked Zarathustra.",
    "The saint answered: “I make hymns and sing them; and in making hymns I laugh and weep and mumble: thus do I praise God.",
    "With singing, weeping, laughing, and mumbling do I praise the God who is my God.",
    "But what dost thou bring us as a gift?”",
    "When Zarathustra had heard these words, he bowed to the saint and said: “What should I have to give thee!",
    "Let me rather hurry hence lest I take aught away from thee!”—And thus they parted from one another, the old man and Zarathustra, laughing like schoolboys.",
    "When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: “Could it be possible!",
    "This old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it, that GOD IS DEAD!”",
    "3.",
    "When Zarathustra arrived at the nearest town which adjoineth the forest, he found many people assembled in the market-place; for it had been announced that a rope-dancer would give a performance.",
    "And Zarathustra spake thus unto the people: I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN.",
    "Man is something that is to be surpassed.",
    "What have ye done to surpass man?",
    "All beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves: and ye want to be the ebb of that great tide, and would rather go back to the beast than surpass man?",
    "What is the ape to man?",
    "A laughing-stock, a thing of shame.",
    "And just the same shall man be to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a thing of shame.",
    "Ye have made your way from the worm to man, and much within you is still worm.",
    "Once were ye apes, and even yet man is more of an ape than any of the apes.",
    "Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and phantom.",
    "But do I bid you become phantoms or plants?",
    "Lo, I teach you the Superman!",
    "The Superman is the meaning of the earth.",
    "Let your will say: The Superman SHALL BE the meaning of the earth!",
    "I conjure you, my brethren, REMAIN TRUE TO THE EARTH, and believe not those who speak unto you of superearthly hopes!",
    "Poisoners are they, whether they know it or not.",
    "Despisers of life are they, decaying ones and poisoned ones themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so away with them!",
    "Once blasphemy against God was the greatest blasphemy; but God died, and therewith also those blasphemers.",
    "To blaspheme the earth is now the dreadfulest sin, and to rate the heart of the unknowable higher than the meaning of the earth!",
    "Once the soul looked contemptuously on the body, and then that contempt was the supreme thing:—the soul wished the body meagre, ghastly, and famished.",
    "Thus it thought to escape from the body and the earth.",
    "Oh, that soul was itself meagre, ghastly, and famished; and cruelty was the delight of that soul!",
    "But ye, also, my brethren, tell me: What doth your body say about your soul?",
    "Is your soul not poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency?",
    "Verily, a polluted stream is man.",
    "One must be a sea, to receive a polluted stream without becoming impure.",
    "Lo, I teach you the Superman: he is that sea; in him can your great contempt be submerged.",
    "What is the greatest thing ye can experience?",
    "It is the hour of great contempt.",
    "The hour in which even your happiness becometh loathsome unto you, and so also your reason and virtue.",
    "The hour when ye say: “What good is my happiness!",
    "It is poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency.",
    "But my happiness should justify existence itself!”",
    "The hour when ye say: “What good is my reason!",
    "Doth it long for knowledge as the lion for his food?",
    "It is poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency!”",
    "The hour when ye say: “What good is my virtue!",
    "As yet it hath not made me passionate.",
    "How weary I am of my good and my bad!",
    "It is all poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency!”",
    "The hour when ye say: “What good is my justice!",
    "I do not see that I am fervour and fuel.",
    "The just, however, are fervour and fuel!”",
    "The hour when ye say: “What good is my pity!",
    "Is not pity the cross on which he is nailed who loveth man?",
    "But my pity is not a crucifixion.”",
    "Have ye ever spoken thus?",
    "Have ye ever cried thus?",
    "Ah! would that I had heard you crying thus!",
    "It is not your sin—it is your self-satisfaction that crieth unto heaven; your very sparingness in sin crieth unto heaven!",
    "Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue?",
    "Where is the frenzy with which ye should be inoculated?",
    "Lo, I teach you the Superman: he is that lightning, he is that frenzy!—",
    "When Zarathustra had thus spoken, one of the people called out: “We have now heard enough of the rope-dancer; it is time now for us to see him!”",
    "And all the people laughed at Zarathustra.",
    "But the rope-dancer, who thought the words applied to him, began his performance.",
    "4. Zarathustra, however, looked at the people and wondered.",
    "Then he spake thus: Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman—a rope over an abyss.",
    "A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting.",
    "What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is lovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.",
    "I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they are the over-goers.",
    "I love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and arrows of longing for the other shore.",
    "I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going down and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive.",
    "I love him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in order that the Superman may hereafter live.",
    "Thus seeketh he his own down-going.",
    "I love him who laboureth and inventeth, that he may build the house for the Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, and plant: for thus seeketh he his own down-going.",
    "I love him who loveth his virtue: for virtue is the will to down-going, and an arrow of longing.",
    "I love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself, but wanteth to be wholly the spirit of his virtue: thus walketh he as spirit over the bridge.",
    "I love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny: thus, for the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more.",
    "I love him who desireth not too many virtues.",
    "One virtue is more of a virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one’s destiny to cling to.",
    "I love him whose soul is lavish, who wanteth no thanks and doth not give back: for he always bestoweth, and desireth not to keep for himself.",
    "I love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour, and who then asketh: “Am I a dishonest player?”—for he is willing to succumb.",
    "I love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his deeds, and always doeth more than he promiseth: for he seeketh his own down-going.",
    "I love him who justifieth the future ones, and redeemeth the past ones: for he is willing to succumb through the present ones.",
    "I love him who chasteneth his God, because he loveth his God: for he must succumb through the wrath of his God.",
    "I love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and may succumb through a small matter: thus goeth he willingly over the bridge.",
    "I love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgetteth himself, and all things are in him: thus all things become his down-going.",
    "I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart: thus is his head only the bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causeth his down-going.",
    "I love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark cloud that lowereth over man: they herald the coming of the lightning, and succumb as heralds.",
    "Lo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud: the lightning, however, is the SUPERMAN.—",
    "5.",
    "When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he again looked at the people, and was silent.",
    "“There they stand,” said he to his heart; “there they laugh: they understand me not; I am not the mouth for these ears.",
    "Must one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear with their eyes?",
    "Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers?",
    "Or do they only believe the stammerer?",
    "They have something whereof they are proud.",
    "What do they call it, that which maketh them proud?",
    "Culture, they call it; it distinguisheth them from the goatherds.",
    "They dislike, therefore, to hear of ‘contempt’ of themselves.",
    "So I will appeal to their pride.",
    "I will speak unto them of the most contemptible thing: that, however, is THE LAST MAN!”",
    "And thus spake Zarathustra unto the people: It is time for man to fix his goal.",
    "It is time for man to plant the germ of his highest hope.",
    "Still is his soil rich enough for it.",
    "But that soil will one day be poor and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be able to grow thereon.",
    "Alas!",
    "there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of his longing beyond man—and the string of his bow will have unlearned to whizz!",
    "I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star.",
    "I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.",
    "Alas!",
    "There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any star.",
    "Alas!",
    "There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no longer despise himself.",
    "Lo!",
    "I show you THE LAST MAN.",
    "“What is love?",
    "What is creation?",
    "What is longing?",
    "What is a star?”—so asketh the last man and blinketh.",
    "The earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last man who maketh everything small.",
    "His species is ineradicable like that of the ground-flea; the last man liveth longest.",
    "“We have discovered happiness”—say the last men, and blink thereby.",
    "They have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need warmth.",
    "One still loveth one’s neighbour and rubbeth against him; for one needeth warmth.",
    "Turning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they walk warily.",
    "He is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or men!",
    "A little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams.",
    "And much poison at last for a pleasant death.",
    "One still worketh, for work is a pastime.",
    "But one is careful lest the pastime should hurt one.",
    "One no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burdensome.",
    "Who still wanteth to rule?",
    "Who still wanteth to obey?",
    "Both are too burdensome.",
    "No shepherd, and one herd!",
    "Every one wanteth the same; every one is equal: he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.",
    "“Formerly all the world was insane,”—say the subtlest of them, and blink thereby.",
    "They are clever and know all that hath happened: so there is no end to their raillery.",
    "People still fall out, but are soon reconciled—otherwise it spoileth their stomachs.",
    "They have their little pleasures for the day, and their little pleasures for the night, but they have a regard for health.",
    "“We have discovered happiness,”—say the last men, and blink thereby.—",
    "And here ended the first discourse of Zarathustra, which is also called “The Prologue”: for at this point the shouting and mirth of the multitude interrupted him.",
    "“Give us this last man, O Zarathustra,”—they called out—“make us into these last men!",
    "Then will we make thee a present of the Superman!”",
    "And all the people exulted and smacked their lips.",
    "Zarathustra, however, turned sad, and said to his heart: “They understand me not: I am not the mouth for these ears.",
    "Too long, perhaps, have I lived in the mountains; too much have I hearkened unto the brooks and trees: now do I speak unto them as unto the goatherds.",
    "Calm is my soul, and clear, like the mountains in the morning.",
    "But they think me cold, and a mocker with terrible jests.",
    "And now do they look at me and laugh: and while they laugh they hate me too.",
    "There is ice in their laughter.”",
    "6.",
    "Then, however, something happened which made every mouth mute and every eye fixed.",
    "In the meantime, of course, the rope-dancer had commenced his performance: he had come out at a little door, and was going along the rope which was stretched between two towers, so that it hung above the market-place and the people.",
    "When he was just midway across, the little door opened once more, and a gaudily-dressed fellow like a buffoon sprang out, and went rapidly after the first one.",
    "“Go on, halt-foot,” cried his frightful voice, “go on, lazy-bones, interloper, sallow-face!—lest I tickle thee with my heel!",
    "What dost thou here between the towers?",
    "In the tower is the place for thee, thou shouldst be locked up; to one better than thyself thou blockest the way!”—And with every word he came nearer and nearer the first one.",
    "When, however, he was but a step behind, there happened the frightful thing which made every mouth mute and every eye fixed—he uttered a yell like a devil, and jumped over the other who was in his way.",
    "The latter, however, when he thus saw his rival triumph, lost at the same time his head and his footing on the rope; he threw his pole away, and shot downwards faster than it, like an eddy of arms and legs, into the depth.",
    "The market-place and the people were like the sea when the storm cometh on: they all flew apart and in disorder, especially where the body was about to fall.",
    "Zarathustra, however, remained standing, and just beside him fell the body, badly injured and disfigured, but not yet dead.",
    "After a while consciousness returned to the shattered man, and he saw Zarathustra kneeling beside him.",
    "“What art thou doing there?” said he at last, “I knew long ago that the devil would trip me up.",
    "Now he draggeth me to hell:",
    "wilt thou prevent him?”",
    "“On mine honour, my friend,” answered Zarathustra, “there is nothing of all that whereof thou speakest: there is no devil and no hell.",
    "Thy soul will be dead even sooner than thy body: fear, therefore, nothing any more!”",
    "The man looked up distrustfully.",
    "“If thou speakest the truth,” said he, “I lose nothing when I lose my life.",
    "I am not much more than an animal which hath been taught to dance by blows and scanty fare.”",
    "“Not at all,” said Zarathustra, “thou hast made danger thy calling; therein there is nothing contemptible.",
    "Now thou perishest by thy calling: therefore will I bury thee with mine own hands.”",
    "When Zarathustra had said this the dying one did not reply further; but he moved his hand as if he sought the hand of Zarathustra in gratitude.",
    "7.",
    "Meanwhile the evening came on, and the market-place veiled itself in gloom.",
    "Then the people dispersed, for even curiosity and terror become fatigued.",
    "Zarathustra, however, still sat beside the dead man on the ground, absorbed in thought: so he forgot the time.",
    "But at last it became night, and a cold wind blew upon the lonely one.",
    "Then arose Zarathustra and said to his heart: Verily, a fine catch of fish hath Zarathustra made to-day!",
    "It is not a man he hath caught, but a corpse.",
    "Sombre is human life, and as yet without meaning: a buffoon may be fateful to it.",
    "I want to teach men the sense of their existence, which is the Superman, the lightning out of the dark cloud—man.",
    "But still am I far from them, and my sense speaketh not unto their sense.",
    "To men I am still something between a fool and a corpse.",
    "Gloomy is the night, gloomy are the ways of Zarathustra.",
    "Come, thou cold and stiff companion!",
    "I carry thee to the place where I shall bury thee with mine own hands.",
    "8.",
    "When Zarathustra had said this to his heart, he put the corpse upon his shoulders and set out on his way.",
    "Yet had he not gone a hundred steps, when there stole a man up to him and whispered in his ear—and lo!",
    "he that spake was the buffoon from the tower.",
    "“Leave this town, O Zarathustra,” said he, “there are too many here who hate thee.",
    "The good and just hate thee, and call thee their enemy and despiser; the believers in the orthodox belief hate thee, and call thee a danger to the multitude.",
    "It was thy good fortune to be laughed at: and verily thou spakest like a buffoon.",
    "It was thy good fortune to associate with the dead dog; by so humiliating thyself thou hast saved thy life to-day.",
    "Depart, however, from this town,—or to-morrow I shall jump over thee, a living man over a dead one.”",
    "And when he had said this, the buffoon vanished; Zarathustra, however, went on through the dark streets.",
    "At the gate of the town the grave-diggers met him: they shone their torch on his face, and, recognising Zarathustra, they sorely derided him.",
    "“Zarathustra is carrying away the dead dog: a fine thing that Zarathustra hath turned a grave-digger!",
    "For our hands are too cleanly for that roast.",
    "Will Zarathustra steal the bite from the devil?",
    "Well then, good luck to the repast!",
    "If only the devil is not a better thief than Zarathustra!—he will steal them both, he will eat them both!”",
    "And they laughed among themselves, and put their heads together.",
    "Zarathustra made no answer thereto, but went on his way.",
    "When he had gone on for two hours, past forests and swamps, he had heard too much of the hungry howling of the wolves, and he himself became a-hungry.",
    "So he halted at a lonely house in which a light was burning.",
    "“Hunger attacketh me,” said Zarathustra, “like a robber.",
    "Among forests and swamps my hunger attacketh me, and late in the night.",
    "“Strange humours hath my hunger.",
    "Often it cometh to me only after a repast, and all day it hath failed to come: where hath it been?”",
    "And thereupon Zarathustra knocked at the door of the house.",
    "An old man appeared, who carried a light, and asked: “Who cometh unto me and my bad sleep?”",
    "“A living man and a dead one,” said Zarathustra.",
    "“Give me something to eat and drink, I forgot it during the day.",
    "He that feedeth the hungry refresheth his own soul, saith wisdom.”",
    "The old man withdrew, but came back immediately and offered Zarathustra bread and wine.",
    "“A bad country for the hungry,” said he; “that is why I live here.",
    "Animal and man come unto me, the anchorite.",
    "But bid thy companion eat and drink also, he is wearier than thou.”",
    "Zarathustra answered: “My companion is dead; I shall hardly be able to persuade him to eat.”",
    "“That doth not concern me,” said the old man sullenly; “he that knocketh at my door must take what I offer him.",
    "Eat, and fare ye well!”",
    "— Thereafter Zarathustra again went on for two hours, trusting to the path and the light of the stars: for he was an experienced night-walker, and liked to look into the face of all that slept.",
    "When the morning dawned, however, Zarathustra found himself in a thick forest, and no path was any longer visible.",
    "He then put the dead man in a hollow tree at his head—for he wanted to protect him from the wolves—and laid himself down on the ground and moss.",
    "And immediately he fell asleep, tired in body, but with a tranquil soul.",
    "9.",
    "Long slept Zarathustra; and not only the rosy dawn passed over his head, but also the morning.",
    "At last, however, his eyes opened, and amazedly he gazed into the forest and the stillness, amazedly he gazed into himself.",
    "Then he arose quickly, like a seafarer who all at once seeth the land; and he shouted for joy: for he saw a new truth.",
    "And he spake thus to his heart: A light hath dawned upon me: I need companions—living ones; not dead companions and corpses, which I carry with me where I will.",
    "But I need living companions, who will follow me because they want to follow themselves—and to the place where I will.",
    "A light hath dawned upon me.",
    "Not to the people is Zarathustra to speak, but to companions!",
    "Zarathustra shall not be the herd’s herdsman and hound!",
    "To allure many from the herd—for that purpose have I come.",
    "The people and the herd must be angry with me: a robber shall Zarathustra be called by the herdsmen.",
    "Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the good and just.",
    "Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the believers in the orthodox belief.",
    "Behold the good and just!",
    "Whom do they hate most?",
    "Him who breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker:—he, however, is the creator.",
    "Behold the believers of all beliefs!",
    "Whom do they hate most?",
    "Him who breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker—he, however, is the creator.",
    "Companions, the creator seeketh, not corpses—and not herds or believers either.",
    "Fellow-creators the creator seeketh—those who grave new values on new tables.",
    "Companions, the creator seeketh, and fellow-reapers: for everything is ripe for the harvest with him.",
    "But he lacketh the hundred sickles: so he plucketh the ears of corn and is vexed.",
    "Companions, the creator seeketh, and such as know how to whet their sickles.",
    "Destroyers, will they be called, and despisers of good and evil.",
    "But they are the reapers and rejoicers.",
    "Fellow-creators, Zarathustra seeketh; fellow-reapers and fellow-rejoicers, Zarathustra seeketh: what hath he to do with herds and herdsmen and corpses!",
    "And thou, my first companion, rest in peace!",
    "Well have I buried thee in thy hollow tree; well have I hid thee from the wolves.",
    "But I part from thee; the time hath arrived.",
    "‘Twixt rosy dawn and rosy dawn there came unto me a new truth.",
    "I am not to be a herdsman, I am not to be a grave-digger.",
    "Not any more will I discourse unto the people; for the last time have I spoken unto the dead.",
    "With the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers will I associate: the rainbow will I show them, and all the stairs to the Superman.",
    "To the lone-dwellers will I sing my song, and to the twain-dwellers; and unto him who hath still ears for the unheard, will I make the heart heavy with my happiness.",
    "I make for my goal, I follow my course; over the loitering and tardy will I leap.",
    "Thus let my on-going be their down-going!",
    "10.",
    "This had Zarathustra said to his heart when the sun stood at noontide.",
    "Then he looked inquiringly aloft,—for he heard above him the sharp call of a bird.",
    "And behold!",
    "An eagle swept through the air in wide circles, and on it hung a serpent, not like a prey, but like a friend: for it kept itself coiled round the eagle’s neck.",
    "“They are mine animals,” said Zarathustra, and rejoiced in his heart.",
    "“The proudest animal under the sun, and the wisest animal under the sun,—they have come out to reconnoitre.",
    "They want to know whether Zarathustra still liveth.",
    "Verily, do I still live?",
    "More dangerous have I found it among men than among animals; in dangerous paths goeth Zarathustra.",
    "Let mine animals lead me!”",
    "When Zarathustra had said this, he remembered the words of the saint in the forest.",
    "Then he sighed and spake thus to his heart: “Would that I were wiser!",
    "Would that I were wise from the very heart, like my serpent!",
    "But I am asking the impossible.",
    "Therefore do I ask my pride to go always with my wisdom!",
    "And if my wisdom should some day forsake me:—alas! it loveth to fly away!—may my pride then fly with my folly!”",
    "Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going.",
    "ZARATHUSTRA’S DISCOURSES.",
    "I.",
    "THE THREE METAMORPHOSES.",
    "Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.",
    "Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing spirit in which reverence dwelleth: for the heavy and the heaviest longeth its strength.",
    "What is heavy?",
    "so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it down like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden.",
    "What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes?",
    "asketh the load-bearing spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.",
    "Is it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one’s pride?",
    "To exhibit one’s folly in order to mock at one’s wisdom?",
    "Or is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph?",
    "To ascend high mountains to tempt the tempter?",
    "Or is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?",
    "Or is it this: To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make friends of the deaf, who never hear thy requests?",
    "Or is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and not disclaim cold frogs and hot toads?",
    "Or is it this:",
    "To love those who despise us, and give one’s hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten us?",
    "All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself: and like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into the wilderness, so hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness.",
    "But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis: here the spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it capture, and lordship in its own wilderness.",
    "Its last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to its last God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon.",
    "What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call Lord and God?",
    "“Thou shalt,” is the great dragon called.",
    "But the spirit of the lion saith, “I will.”",
    "“Thou shalt,” lieth in its path, sparkling with gold—a scale-covered beast; and on every scale glittereth golden, “Thou shalt!”",
    "The values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and thus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: “All the values of things—glitter on me.",
    "All values have already been created, and all created values—do I represent.",
    "Verily, there shall be no ‘I will’ any more.”",
    "Thus speaketh the dragon.",
    "My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit?",
    "Why sufficeth not the beast of burden, which renounceth and is reverent?",
    "To create new values—that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating—that can the might of the lion do.",
    "To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty: for that, my brethren, there is need of the lion.",
    "To assume the right to new values—that is the most formidable assumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit.",
    "Verily, unto such a spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey.",
    "As its holiest, it once loved “Thou shalt”: now is it forced to find illusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that it may capture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for this capture.",
    "But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion could not do?",
    "Why hath the preying lion still to become a child?",
    "Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea.",
    "Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: ITS OWN will, willeth now the spirit; HIS OWN world winneth the world’s outcast.",
    "Three metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.—",
    "Thus spake Zarathustra.",
    "And at that time he abode in the town which is called The Pied Cow.",
    "II.",
    "THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE.",
    "People commended unto Zarathustra a wise man, as one who could discourse well about sleep and virtue: greatly was he honoured and rewarded for it, and all the youths sat before his chair.",
    "To him went Zarathustra, and sat among the youths before his chair.",
    "And thus spake the wise man: Respect and modesty in presence of sleep!",
    "That is the first thing!",
    "And to go out of the way of all who sleep badly and keep awake at night!",
    "Modest is even the thief in presence of sleep: he always stealeth softly through the night.",
    "Immodest, however, is the night-watchman; immodestly he carrieth his horn.",
    "No small art is it to sleep: it is necessary for that purpose to keep awake all day.",
    "Ten times a day must thou overcome thyself: that causeth wholesome weariness, and is poppy to the soul.",
    "Ten times must thou reconcile again with thyself; for overcoming is bitterness, and badly sleep the unreconciled.",
    "Ten truths must thou find during the day; otherwise wilt thou seek truth during the night, and thy soul will have been hungry.",
    "Ten times must thou laugh during the day, and be cheerful; otherwise thy stomach, the father of affliction, will disturb thee in the night.",
    "Few people know it, but one must have all the virtues in order to sleep well.",
    "Shall I bear false witness?",
    "Shall I commit adultery?",
    "Shall I covet my neighbour’s maidservant?",
    "All that would ill accord with good sleep.",
    "And even if one have all the virtues, there is still one thing needful: to send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right time.",
    "That they may not quarrel with one another, the good females!",
    "And about thee, thou unhappy one!",
    "Peace with God and thy neighbour: so desireth good sleep.",
    "And peace also with thy neighbour’s devil!",
    "Otherwise it will haunt thee in the night.",
    "Honour to the government, and obedience, and also to the crooked government!",
    "So desireth good sleep.",
    "How can I help it, if power like to walk on crooked legs?",
    "He who leadeth his sheep to the greenest pasture, shall always be for me the best shepherd: so doth it accord with good sleep.",
    "Many honours I want not, nor great treasures: they excite the spleen.",
    "But it is bad sleeping without a good name and a little treasure.",
    "A small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but they must come and go at the right time.",
    "So doth it accord with good sleep.",
    "Well, also, do the poor in spirit please me: they promote sleep.",
    "Blessed are they, especially if one always give in to them.",
    "Thus passeth the day unto the virtuous.",
    "When night cometh, then take I good care not to summon sleep.",
    "It disliketh to be summoned—sleep, the lord of the virtues!",
    "But I think of what I have done and thought during the day.",
    "Thus ruminating, patient as a cow, I ask myself: What were thy ten overcomings?",
    "And what were the ten reconciliations, and the ten truths, and the ten laughters with which my heart enjoyed itself?",
    "Thus pondering, and cradled by forty thoughts, it overtaketh me all at once—sleep, the unsummoned, the lord of the virtues.",
    "Sleep tappeth on mine eye, and it turneth heavy.",
    "Sleep toucheth my mouth, and it remaineth open.",
    "Verily, on soft soles doth it come to me, the dearest of thieves, and stealeth from me my thoughts: stupid do I then stand, like this academic chair.",
    "But not much longer do I then stand: I already lie.—",
    "When Zarathustra heard the wise man thus speak, he laughed in his heart: for thereby had a light dawned upon him.",
    "And thus spake he to his heart: A fool seemeth this wise man with his forty thoughts: but I believe he knoweth",
    "well how to sleep.",
    "Happy even is he who liveth near this wise man!",
    "Such sleep is contagious—even through a thick wall it is contagious.",
    "A magic resideth even in his academic chair.",
    "And not in vain did the youths sit before the preacher of virtue.",
    "His wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well.",
    "And verily, if life had no sense, and had I to choose nonsense, this would be the desirablest nonsense for me also.",
    "Now know I well what people sought formerly above all else when they sought teachers of virtue.",
    "Good sleep they sought for themselves, and poppy-head virtues to promote it!",
    "To all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep without dreams: they knew no higher significance of life.",
    "Even at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of virtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is past.",
    "And not much longer do they stand: there they already lie.",
    "Blessed are those drowsy ones: for they shall soon nod to sleep.—",
    "Thus spake Zarathustra.",
    "III.",
    "BACKWORLDSMEN.",
    "Once on a time, Zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man, like all backworldsmen.",
    "The work of a suffering and tortured God, did the world then seem to me.",
    "The dream—and diction—of a God, did the world then seem to me; coloured vapours before the eyes of a divinely dissatisfied one.",
    "Good and evil, and joy and woe, and I and thou—coloured vapours did they seem to me before creative eyes.",
    "The creator wished to look away from himself,—thereupon he created the world.",
    "Intoxicating joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his suffering and forget himself.",
    "Intoxicating joy and self-forgetting, did the world once seem to me.",
    "This world, the eternally imperfect, an eternal contradiction’s image and imperfect image—an intoxicating joy to its imperfect creator:—thus did the world once seem to me.",
    "Thus, once on a time, did I also cast my fancy beyond man, like all backworldsmen.",
    "Beyond man, forsooth?",
    "Ah, ye brethren, that God whom I created was human work and human madness, like all the Gods!",
    "A man was he, and only a poor fragment of a man and ego.",
    "Out of mine own ashes and glow it came unto me, that phantom.",
    "And verily, it came not unto me from the beyond!",
    "What happened, my brethren?",
    "I surpassed myself, the suffering one; I carried mine own ashes to the mountain; a brighter flame I contrived for myself.",
    "And lo!",
    "Thereupon the phantom WITHDREW from me!",
    "To me the convalescent would it now be suffering and torment to believe in such phantoms: suffering would it now be to me, and humiliation.",
    "Thus speak I to backworldsmen.",
    "Suffering was it, and impotence—that created all backworlds; and the short madness of happiness, which only the greatest sufferer experienceth.",
    "Weariness, which seeketh to get to the ultimate with one leap, with a death-leap; a poor ignorant weariness, unwilling even to will any longer: that created all Gods and backworlds.",
    "Believe me, my brethren!",
    "It was the body which despaired of the body—it groped with the fingers of the infatuated spirit at the ultimate walls.",
    "Believe me, my brethren!",
    "It was the body which despaired of the earth—it heard the bowels of existence speaking unto it.",
    "And then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its head—and not with its head only—into “the other world.”",
    "But that “other world” is well concealed from man, that dehumanised, inhuman world, which is a celestial naught; and the bowels of existence do not speak unto man, except as man.",
    "Verily, it is difficult to prove all being, and hard to make it speak.",
    "Tell me, ye brethren, is not the strangest of all things best proved?",
    "Yea, this ego, with its contradiction and perplexity, speaketh most uprightly of its being—this creating, willing, evaluing ego, which is the measure and value of things.",
    "And this most upright existence, the ego—it speaketh of the body, and still implieth the body, even when it museth and raveth and fluttereth with broken wings.",
    "Always more uprightly learneth it to speak, the ego; and the more it learneth, the more doth it find titles and honours for the body and the earth.",
    "A new pride taught me mine ego, and that teach I unto men: no longer to thrust one’s head into the sand of celestial things, but to carry it freely, a terrestrial head, which giveth meaning to the earth!",
    "A new will teach I unto men: to choose that path which man hath followed blindly, and to approve of it—and no longer to slink aside from it, like the sick and perishing!",
    "The sick and perishing—it was they who despised the body and the earth, and invented the heavenly world, and the redeeming blood-drops; but even those sweet and sad poisons they borrowed from the body and the earth!",
    "From their misery they sought escape, and the stars were too remote for them.",
    "Then they sighed: “O that there were heavenly paths by which to steal into another existence and into happiness!”",
    "Then they contrived for themselves their by-paths and bloody draughts!",
    "Beyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now fancied themselves transported, these ungrateful ones.",
    "But to what did they owe the convulsion and rapture of their transport?",
    "To their body and this earth.",
    "Gentle is Zarathustra to the sickly.",
    "Verily, he is not indignant at their modes of consolation and ingratitude.",
    "May they become convalescents and overcomers, and create higher bodies for themselves!",
    "Neither is Zarathustra indignant at a convalescent who looketh tenderly on his delusions, and at midnight stealeth round the grave of his God; but sickness and a sick frame remain even in his tears.",
    "Many sickly ones have there always been among those who muse, and languish for God; violently they hate the discerning ones, and the latest of virtues, which is uprightness.",
    "Backward they always gaze toward dark ages: then, indeed, were delusion and faith something different.",
    "Raving of the reason was likeness to God, and doubt was sin.",
    "Too well do I know those godlike ones: they insist on being believed in, and that doubt is sin.",
    "Too well, also, do I know what they themselves most believe in.",
    "Verily, not in backworlds and redeeming blood-drops: but in the body do they also believe most; and their own body is for them the thing-in-itself.",
    "But it is a sickly thing to them, and gladly would they get out of their skin.",
    "Therefore hearken they to the preachers of death, and themselves preach backworlds.",
    "Hearken rather, my brethren, to the voice of the healthy body; it is a more upright and pure voice.",
    "More uprightly and purely speaketh the healthy body, perfect and square-built; and it speaketh of the meaning of the earth.—",
    "Thus spake Zarathustra.",
    "IV.",
    "THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY.",
    "To the despisers of the body will I speak my word.",
    "I wish them neither to learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid farewell to their own bodies,—and thus be dumb.",
    "“Body am I, and soul”—so saith the child.",
    "And why should one not speak like children?",
    "But the awakened one, the knowing one, saith: “Body am I entirely, and nothing more; and soul is only the name of something in the body.”",
    "The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a peace, a flock and a shepherd.",
    "An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother, which thou callest “spirit”—a little instrument and plaything of thy big sagacity.",
    "“Ego,” sayest thou, and art proud of that word.",
    "But the greater thing—in which thou art unwilling to believe—is thy body with its big sagacity; it saith not “ego,” but doeth it.",
    "What the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath never its end in itself.",
    "But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they are the end of all things: so vain are they.",
    "Instruments and playthings are sense and spirit: behind them there is still the Self.",
    "The Self seeketh with the eyes of the senses, it hearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit.",
    "Ever hearkeneth the Self, and seeketh; it compareth, mastereth, conquereth, and destroyeth.",
    "It ruleth, and is also the ego’s ruler.",
    "Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord, an unknown sage—it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy body.",
    "There is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wisdom.",
    "And who then knoweth why thy body requireth just thy best wisdom?",
    "Thy Self laugheth at thine ego, and its proud prancings.",
    "“What are these prancings and flights of thought unto me?”",
    "it saith to itself.",
    "“A by-way to my purpose.",
    "I am the leading-string of the ego, and the prompter of its notions.”",
    "The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pain!”",
    "And thereupon it suffereth, and thinketh how it may put an end thereto—and for that very purpose it IS MEANT to think.",
    "The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pleasure!”",
    "Thereupon it rejoiceth, and thinketh how it may ofttimes rejoice—and for that very purpose it IS MEANT to think.",
    "To the despisers of the body will I speak a word.",
    "That they despise is caused by their esteem.",
    "What is it that created esteeming and despising and worth and will?",
    "The creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, it created for itself joy and woe.",
    "The creating body created for itself spirit, as a hand to its will.",
    "Even in your folly and despising ye each serve your Self, ye despisers of the body.",
    "I tell you, your very Self wanteth to die, and turneth away from life.",
    "No longer can your Self do that which it desireth most:—create beyond itself.",
    "That is what it desireth most; that is all its fervour.",
    "But it is now too late to do so:—so your Self wisheth to succumb, ye despisers of the body.",
    "To succumb—so wisheth your Self; and therefore have ye become despisers of the body.",
    "For ye can no longer create beyond yourselves.",
    "And therefore are ye now angry with life and with the earth.",
    "And unconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt.",
    "I go not your way, ye despisers of the body!",
    "Ye are no bridges for me to the Superman!—",
    "Thus spake Zarathustra.",
    "V. JOYS AND PASSIONS.",
    "My brother, when thou hast a virtue, and it is thine own virtue, thou hast it in common with no one.",
    "To be sure, thou wouldst call it by name and caress it; thou wouldst pull its ears and amuse thyself with it.",
    "And lo!",
    "Then hast thou its name in common with the people, and hast become one of the people and the herd with thy virtue!",
    "Better for thee to say: “Ineffable is it, and nameless, that which is pain and sweetness to my soul, and also the hunger of my bowels.”",
    "Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.",
    "Thus speak and stammer: “That is MY good, that do I love, thus doth it please me entirely, thus only do _I_ desire the good.",
    "Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law or a human need do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for me to superearths and paradises.",
    "An earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is therein, and the least everyday wisdom.",
    "But that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and cherish it—now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs.”",
    "Thus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue.",
    "Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil.",
    "But now hast thou only thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.",
    "Thou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those passions: then became they thy virtues and joys.",
    "And though thou wert of the race of the hot-tempered, or of the voluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive; All thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils angels.",
    "Once hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar: but they changed at last into birds and charming songstresses.",
    "Out of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself; thy cow, affliction, milkedst thou—now drinketh thou the sweet milk of her udder.",
    "And nothing evil groweth in thee any longer, unless it be the evil that groweth out of the conflict of thy virtues.",
    "My brother, if thou be fortunate, then wilt thou have one virtue and no more: thus goest thou easier over the bridge.",
    "Illustrious is it to have many virtues, but a hard lot; and many a one hath gone into the wilderness and killed himself, because he was weary of being the battle and battlefield of virtues.",
    "My brother, are war and battle evil?",
    "Necessary, however, is the evil; necessary are the envy and the distrust and the back-biting among the virtues.",
    "Lo!",
    "how each of thy virtues is covetous of the highest place; it wanteth thy whole spirit to be ITS herald, it wanteth thy whole power, in wrath, hatred, and love.",
    "Jealous is every virtue of the others, and a dreadful thing is jealousy.",
    "Even virtues may succumb by jealousy.",
    "He whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth, turneth at last, like the scorpion, the poisoned sting against himself.",
    "Ah!",
    "my brother, hast thou never seen a virtue backbite and stab itself?",
    "Man is something that hath to be surpassed: and therefore shalt thou love thy virtues,—for thou wilt succumb by them.—",
    "Thus spake Zarathustra. VI.",
    "THE PALE CRIMINAL.",
    "Ye do not mean to slay, ye judges and sacrificers, until the animal hath bowed its head?",
    "Lo!",
    "the pale criminal hath bowed his head: out of his eye speaketh the great contempt.",
    "“Mine ego is something which is to be surpassed: mine ego is to me the great contempt of man”: so speaketh it out of that eye.",
    "When he judged himself—that was his supreme moment; let not the exalted one relapse again into his low estate!",
    "There is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from himself, unless it be speedy death.",
    "Your slaying, ye judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; and in that ye slay, see to it that ye yourselves justify life!",
    "It is not enough that ye should reconcile with him whom ye slay.",
    "Let your sorrow be love to the Superman: thus will ye justify your own survival!",
    "“Enemy” shall ye say but not “villain,” “invalid” shall ye say but not “wretch,” “fool” shall ye say but not “sinner.”",
    "And thou, red judge, if thou would say audibly all thou hast done in thought, then would every one cry: “Away with the nastiness and the virulent reptile!”",
    "But one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, and another thing is the idea of the deed.",
    "The wheel of causality doth not roll between them.",
    "An idea made this pale man pale.",
    "Adequate was he for his deed when he did it, but the idea of it, he could not endure when it was done.",
    "Evermore did he now see himself as the doer of one deed.",
    "Madness, I call this: the exception reversed itself to the rule in him.",
    "The streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck bewitched his weak reason.",
    "Madness AFTER the deed, I call this.",
    "Hearken, ye judges!",
    "There is another madness besides, and it is BEFORE the deed.",
    "Ah! ye have not gone deep enough into this soul!",
    "Thus speaketh the red judge: “Why did this criminal commit murder?",
    "He meant to rob.”",
    "I tell you, however, that his soul wanted blood, not booty: he thirsted for the happiness of the knife!",
    "But his weak reason understood not this madness, and it persuaded him.",
    "“What matter about blood!”",
    "it said; “wishest thou not, at least, to make booty thereby?",
    "Or take revenge?”",
    "And he hearkened unto his weak reason: like lead lay its words upon him—thereupon he robbed when he murdered.",
    "He did not mean to be ashamed of his madness.",
    "And now once more lieth the lead of his guilt upon him, and once more is his weak reason so benumbed, so paralysed, and so dull.",
    "Could he only shake his head, then would his burden roll off; but who shaketh that head?",
    "What is this man?",
    "A mass of diseases that reach out into the world through the spirit; there they want to get their prey.",
    "What is this man?",
    "A coil of wild serpents that are seldom at peace among themselves—so they go forth apart and seek prey in the world.",
    "Look at that poor body!",
    "What it suffered and craved, the poor soul interpreted to itself—it interpreted it as murderous desire, and eagerness for the happiness of the knife.",
    "Him who now turneth sick, the evil overtaketh which is now the evil: he seeketh to cause pain with that which causeth him pain.",
    "But there have been other ages, and another evil and good.",
    "Once was doubt evil, and the will to Self.",
    "Then the invalid became a heretic or sorcerer; as heretic or sorcerer he suffered, and sought to cause suffering.",
    "But this will not enter your ears; it hurteth your good people, ye tell me.",
    "But what doth it matter to me about your good people!",
    "Many things in your good people cause me disgust, and verily, not their evil.",
    "I would that they had a madness by which they succumbed, like this pale criminal!",
    "Verily, I would that their madness were called truth, or fidelity, or justice: but they have their virtue in order to live long, and in wretched self-complacency.",
    "I am a railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me may grasp me!",
    "Your crutch, however, I am not.—",
    "Thus spake Zarathustra.",
    "VII.",
    "READING AND WRITING.",
    "Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood.",
    "Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit.",
    "It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers.",
    "He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader.",
    "Another century of readers—and spirit itself will stink.",
    "Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not only writing but also thinking.",
    "Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh populace.",
    "He that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be read, but learnt by heart.",
    "In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that route thou must have long legs.",
    "Proverbs should be peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall.",
    "The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a joyful wickedness: thus are things well matched.",
    "I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous.",
    "The courage which scareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins—it wanteth to laugh.",
    "I no longer feel in common with you; the very cloud which I see beneath me, the blackness and heaviness at which I laugh—that is your thunder-cloud.",
    "Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; and I look downward because I am exalted.",
    "Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?",
    "He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays and tragic realities.",
    "Courageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive—so wisdom wisheth us; she is a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior.",
    "Ye tell me, “Life is hard to bear.”",
    "But for what purpose should ye have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?",
    "Life is hard to bear: but do not affect to be so delicate!",
    "We are all of us fine sumpter asses and assesses.",
    "What have we in common with the rose-bud, which trembleth because a drop of dew hath formed upon it?",
    "It is true we love life; not because we are wont to live, but because we are wont to love.",
    "There is always some madness in love.",
    "But there is always, also, some method in madness.",
    "And to me also, who appreciate life, the butterflies, and soap-bubbles, and whatever is like them amongst us, seem most to enjoy happiness.",
    "To see these light, foolish, pretty, lively little sprites flit about—that moveth Zarathustra to tears and songs.",
    "I should only believe in a God that would know how to dance.",
    "And when I saw my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound, solemn: he was the spirit of gravity—through him all things fall.",
    "Not by wrath, but by laughter, do we slay.",
    "Come, let us slay the spirit of gravity!",
    "I learned to walk; since then have I let myself run.",
    "I learned to fly; since then I do not need pushing in order to move from a spot.",
    "Now am I light, now do I fly; now do I see myself under myself.",
    "Now there danceth a God in me.—",
    "Thus spake Zarathustra.",
    "VIII.",
    "THE TREE ON THE HILL.",
    "Zarathustra’s eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him.",
    "And as he walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called “The Pied Cow,” behold, there found he the youth sitting leaning against a tree, and gazing with wearied look into the valley.",
    "Zarathustra thereupon laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spake thus: “If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to do so.",
    "But the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it as it listeth.",
    "We are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands.”",
    "Thereupon the youth arose disconcerted, and said: “I hear Zarathustra, and just now was I thinking of him!”",
    "Zarathustra answered: “Why art thou frightened on that account?—But it is the same with man as with the tree.",
    "The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and deep—into the evil.”",
    "“Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth.",
    "“How is it possible that thou hast discovered my soul?”",
    "Zarathustra smiled, and said: “Many a soul one will never discover, unless one first invent it.”",
    "“Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth once more.",
    "“Thou saidst the truth, Zarathustra.",
    "I trust myself no longer since I sought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me any longer; how doth that happen?",
    "I change too quickly: my to-day refuteth my yesterday.",
    "I often overleap the steps when I clamber; for so doing, none of the steps pardons me.",
    "When aloft, I find myself always alone.",
    "No one speaketh unto me; the frost of solitude maketh me tremble.",
    "What do I seek on the height?",
    "My contempt and my longing increase together; the higher I clamber, the more do I despise him who clambereth.",
    "What doth he seek on the height?",
    "How ashamed I am of my clambering and stumbling!",
    "How I mock at my violent panting!",
    "How I hate him who flieth!",
    "How tired I am on the height!”",
    "Here the youth was silent.",
    "And Zarathustra contemplated the tree beside which they stood, and spake thus: “This tree standeth lonely here on the hills; it hath grown up high above man and beast.",
    "And if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could understand it: so high hath it grown.",
    "Now it waiteth and waiteth,—for what doth it wait?",
    "It dwelleth too close to the seat of the clouds; it waiteth perhaps for the first lightning?”",
    "When Zarathustra had said this, the youth called out with violent gestures: “Yea, Zarathustra, thou speakest the truth.",
    "My destruction I longed for, when I desired to be on the height, and thou art the lightning for which I waited!",
    "Lo!",
    "what have I been since thou hast appeared amongst us?",
    "It is mine envy of thee that hath destroyed me!”—Thus spake the youth, and wept bitterly.",
    "Zarathustra, however, put his arm about him, and led the youth away with him.",
    "And when they had walked a while together, Zarathustra began to speak thus: It rendeth my heart.",
    "Better than thy words express it, thine eyes tell me all thy danger.",
    "As yet thou art not free; thou still SEEKEST freedom.",
    "Too unslept hath thy seeking made thee, and too wakeful.",
    "On the open height wouldst thou be; for the stars thirsteth thy soul.",
    "But thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom.",
    "Thy wild dogs want liberty; they bark for joy in their cellar when thy spirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors.",
    "Still art thou a prisoner—it seemeth to me—who deviseth liberty for himself: ah!",
    "sharp becometh the soul of such prisoners, but also deceitful and wicked.",
    "To purify himself, is still necessary for the freedman of the spirit.",
    "Much of the prison and the mould still remaineth in him: pure hath his eye still to become.",
    "Yea, I know thy danger.",
    "But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not thy love and hope away!",
    "Noble thou feelest thyself still, and noble others also feel thee still, though they bear thee a grudge and cast evil looks.",
    "Know this, that to everybody a noble one standeth in the way.",
    "Also to the good, a noble one standeth in the way: and even when they call him a good man, they want thereby to put him aside.",
    "The new, would the noble man create, and a new virtue.",
    "The old, wanteth the good man, and that the old should be conserved.",
    "But it is not the danger of the noble man to turn a good man, but lest he should become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer.",
    "Ah!",
    "I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope.",
    "And then they disparaged all high hopes.",
    "Then lived they shamelessly in temporary pleasures, and beyond the day had hardly an aim.",
    "“Spirit is also voluptuousness,”—said they.",
    "Then broke the wings of their spirit; and now it creepeth about, and defileth where it gnaweth.",
    "Once they thought of becoming heroes; but sensualists are they now.",
    "A trouble and a terror is the hero to them.",
    "But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not away the hero in thy soul!",
    "Maintain holy thy highest hope!—",
    "Thus spake Zarathustra.",
    "IX.",
    "THE PREACHERS OF DEATH.",
    "There are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom desistance from life must be preached.",
    "Full is the earth of the superfluous; marred is life by the many-too-many.",
    "May they be decoyed out of this life by the “life eternal”!",
    "“The yellow ones”: so are called the preachers of death, or “the black ones.”",
    "But I will show them unto you in other colours besides.",
    "There are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves the beast of prey, and have no choice except lusts or self-laceration.",
    "And even their lusts are self-laceration.",
    "They have not yet become men, those terrible ones: may they preach desistance from life, and pass away themselves!",
    "There are the spiritually consumptive ones: hardly are they born when they begin to die, and long for doctrines of lassitude and renunciation.",
    "They would fain be dead, and we should approve of their wish!",
    "Let us beware of awakening those dead ones, and of damaging those living coffins!",
    "They meet an invalid, or an old man, or a corpse—and immediately they say: “Life is refuted!”",
    "But they only are refuted, and their eye, which seeth only o"
