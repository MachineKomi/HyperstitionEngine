    "Stories and Studies of Strange Things By Lafcadio Hearn A Note from the Digitizer On Japanese Pronunciation",
    "Although simplified, the following general rules will help the reader unfamiliar with Japanese to come close enough to Japanese pronunciation.",
    "There are five vowels: a (as in fAther), i (as in machIne), u (as in fOOl), e (as in fEllow), and o (as in mOle).",
    "Although certain vowels become nearly “silent” in some environments, this phenomenon can be safely ignored for the purpose at hand.",
    "Consonants roughly approximate their corresponding sounds in English, except for r, which is actually somewhere between r and l (this is why the Japanese have trouble distinguishing between English r and l), and f, which is much closer to h.",
    "The spelling “KWAIDAN” is based on premodern Japanese pronunciation; when Hearn came to Japan, the orthography reflecting this pronunciation was still in use.",
    "In modern Japanese the word is pronounced KAIDAN.",
    "There are many ellipses in the text.",
    "Hearn often used them in this book; they do not represent omissions by the digitizer.",
    "Author’s original notes are in brackets, those by the digitizer are in parentheses.",

    "The publication of a new volume of Lafcadio Hearn’s exquisite studies of Japan happens, by a delicate irony, to fall in the very month when the world is waiting with tense expectation for news of the latest exploits of Japanese battleships.",
    "Whatever the outcome of the present struggle between Russia and Japan, its significance lies in the fact that a nation of the East, equipped with Western weapons and girding itself with Western energy of will, is deliberately measuring strength against one of the great powers of the Occident.",
    "No one is wise enough to forecast the results of such a conflict upon the civilization of the world.",
    "The best one can do is to estimate, as intelligently as possible, the national characteristics of the peoples engaged, basing one’s hopes and fears upon the psychology of the two races rather than upon purely political and statistical studies of the complicated questions involved in the present war.",
    "The Russian people have had literary spokesmen who for more than a generation have fascinated the European audience.",
    "The Japanese, on the other hand, have possessed no such national and universally recognized figures as Turgenieff or Tolstoy.",
    "They need an interpreter.",
    "It may be doubted whether any oriental race has ever had an interpreter gifted with more perfect insight and sympathy than Lafcadio Hearn has brought to the translation of Japan into our occidental speech.",
    "His long residence in that country, his flexibility of mind, poetic imagination, and wonderfully pellucid style have fitted him for the most delicate of literary tasks.",
    "He has seen marvels, and he has told of them in a marvelous way.",
    "There is scarcely an aspect of contemporary Japanese life, scarcely an element in the social, political, and military questions involved in the present conflict with Russia which is not made clear in one or another of the books with which he has charmed American readers.",
    "He characterizes Kwaidan as “stories and studies of strange things.”",
    "A hundred thoughts suggested by the book might be written down, but most of them would begin and end with this fact of strangeness.",
    "To read the very names in the table of contents is like listening to a Buddhist bell, struck somewhere far away.",
    "Some of his tales are of the long ago, and yet they seem to illumine the very souls and minds of the little men who are at this hour crowding the decks of Japan’s armored cruisers.",
    "But many of the stories are about women and children,—the lovely materials from which the best fairy tales of the world have been woven.",
    "They too are strange, these Japanese maidens and wives and keen-eyed, dark-haired girls and boys; they are like us and yet not like us; and the sky and the hills and the flowers are all different from ours.",
    "Yet by a magic of which Mr. Hearn, almost alone among contemporary writers, is the master, in these delicate, transparent, ghostly sketches of a world unreal to us, there is a haunting sense of spiritual reality.",
    "In a penetrating and beautiful essay contributed to the “Atlantic Monthly” in February, 1903, by Paul Elmer More, the secret of Mr. Hearn’s magic is said to lie in the fact that in his art is found “the meeting of three ways.”",
    "“To the religious instinct of India—Buddhism in particular,—which history has engrafted on the aæsthetic sense of Japan, Mr. Hearn brings the interpreting spirit of occidental science; and these three traditions are fused by the peculiar sympathies of his mind into one rich and novel compound,—a compound so rare as to have introduced into literature a psychological sensation unknown before.”",
    "Mr. More’s essay received the high praise of Mr. Hearn’s recognition and gratitude, and if it were possible to reprint it here, it would provide a most suggestive introduction to these new stories of old Japan, whose substance is, as Mr. More has said, “so strangely mingled together out of the austere dreams of India and the subtle beauty of Japan and the relentless science of Europe.”",
    "_March_, 1904.",
    "Most of the following _Kwaidan_, or Weird Tales, have been taken from old Japanese books,—such as the _Yasō-Kidan_, _Bukkyō-Hyakkwa-Zenshō_, _",
    "Kokon-Chomonshū_, _Tama-Sudaré_, and _Hyaku-Monogatari_.",
    "Some of the stories may have had a Chinese origin: the very remarkable “Dream of Akinosuké,” for example, is certainly from a Chinese source.",
    "But the story-teller, in every case, has so recolored and reshaped his borrowing as to naturalize it...",
    "One queer tale, “Yuki-Onna,” was told me by a farmer of Chōfu, Nishitama-gōri, in Musashi province, as a legend of his native village.",
    "Whether it has ever been written in Japanese I do not know; but the extraordinary belief which it records used certainly to exist in most parts of Japan, and in many curious forms...",
    "The incident of “Riki-Baka” was a personal experience; and I wrote it down almost exactly as it happened, changing only a family-name mentioned by the Japanese narrator.",
    "L. H. TŌKYŌ, JAPAN, January 20th, 1904.",
    "KWAIDAN THE STORY OF MIMI-NASHI-HŌÏCHI More than seven hundred years ago, at Dan-no-ura, in the Straits of Shimonoséki, was fought the last battle of the long contest between the Heiké, or Taira clan, and the Genji, or Minamoto clan.",
    "There the Heiké perished utterly, with their women and children, and their infant emperor likewise—now remembered as Antoku Tennō.",
    "And that sea and shore have been haunted for seven hundred years...",
    "Elsewhere I told you about the strange crabs found there, called Heiké crabs, which have human faces on their backs, and are said to be the spirits of the Heiké warriors[1].",
    "But there are many strange things to be seen and heard along that coast.",
    "On dark nights thousands of ghostly fires hover about the beach, or flit above the waves,—pale lights which the fishermen call _Oni-bi_, or demon-fires; and, whenever the winds are up, a sound of great shouting comes from that sea, like a clamor of battle.",
    "In former years the Heiké were much more restless than they now are.",
    "They would rise about ships passing in the night, and try to sink them; and at all times they would watch for swimmers, to pull them down.",
    "It was in order to appease those dead that the Buddhist temple, Amidaji, was built at Akamagaséki[2].",
    "A cemetery also was made close by, near the beach; and within it were set up monuments inscribed with the names of the drowned emperor and of his great vassals; and Buddhist services were regularly performed there, on behalf of the spirits of them.",
    "After the temple had been built, and the tombs erected, the Heiké gave less trouble than before; but they continued to do queer things at intervals,—proving that they had not found the perfect peace.",
    "Some centuries ago there lived at Akamagaséki a blind man named Hōïchi, who was famed for his skill in recitation and in playing upon the _biwa_[3].",
    "From childhood he had been trained to recite and to play; and while yet a lad he had surpassed his teachers.",
    "As a professional _biwa-hōshi_ he became famous chiefly by his recitations of the history of the Heiké and the Genji; and it is said that when he sang the song of the battle of Dan-no-ura “even the goblins [_kijin_] could not refrain from tears.”",
    "At the outset of his career, Hōïchi was very poor; but he found a good friend to help him.",
    "The priest of the Amidaji was fond of poetry and music; and he often invited Hōïchi to the temple, to play and recite.",
    "Afterwards, being much impressed by the wonderful skill of the lad, the priest proposed that Hōïchi should make the temple his home; and this offer was gratefully accepted.",
    "Hōïchi was given a room in the temple-building; and, in return for food and lodging, he was required only to gratify the priest with a musical performance on certain evenings, when otherwise disengaged.",
    "One summer night the priest was called away, to perform a Buddhist service at the house of a dead parishioner; and he went there with his acolyte, leaving Hōïchi alone in the temple.",
    "It was a hot night; and the blind man sought to cool himself on the verandah before his sleeping-room.",
    "The verandah overlooked a small garden in the rear of the Amidaji.",
    "There Hōïchi waited for the priest’s return, and tried to relieve his solitude by practicing upon his biwa.",
    "Midnight passed; and the priest did not appear.",
    "But the atmosphere was still too warm for comfort within doors; and Hōïchi remained outside.",
    "At last he heard steps approaching from the back gate.",
    "Somebody crossed the garden, advanced to the verandah, and halted directly in front of him—but it was not the priest.",
    "A deep voice called the blind man’s name—abruptly and unceremoniously, in the manner of a samurai summoning an inferior:— “Hōïchi!”",
    "Hōïchi was too much startled, for the moment, to respond; and the voice called again, in a tone of harsh command,— “Hōïchi!”",
    "“_Hai!_”(1) answered the blind man, frightened by the menace in the voice,—“I am blind!—I cannot know who calls!”",
    "“There is nothing to fear,” the stranger exclaimed, speaking more gently.",
    "“I am stopping near this temple, and have been sent to you with a message.",
    "My present lord, a person of exceedingly high rank, is now staying in Akamagaséki, with many noble attendants.",
    "He wished to view the scene of the battle of Dan-no-ura; and to-day he visited that place.",
    "Having heard of your skill in reciting the story of the battle, he now desires to hear your performance: so you will take your biwa and come with me at once to the house where the august assembly is waiting.”",
    "In those times, the order of a samurai was not to be lightly disobeyed.",
    "Hōïchi donned his sandals, took his biwa, and went away with the stranger, who guided him deftly, but obliged him to walk very fast.",
    "The hand that guided was iron; and the clank of the warrior’s stride proved him fully armed,—probably some palace-guard on duty.",
    "Hōïchi’s first alarm was over: he began to imagine himself in good luck;—for, remembering the retainer’s assurance about a “person of exceedingly high rank,” he thought that the lord who wished to hear the recitation could not be less than a daimyō of the first class.",
    "Presently the samurai halted; and Hōïchi became aware that they had arrived at a large gateway;—and he wondered, for he could not remember any large gate in that part of the town, except the main gate of the Amidaji.",
    "“_Kaimon!_”[4] the samurai called,—and there was a sound of unbarring; and the twain passed on.",
    "They traversed a space of garden, and halted again before some entrance; and the retainer cried in a loud voice, “Within there!",
    "I have brought Hōïchi.”",
    "Then came sounds of feet hurrying, and screens sliding, and rain-doors opening, and voices of women in converse.",
    "By the language of the women Hōïchi knew them to be domestics in some noble household; but he could not imagine to what place he had been conducted.",
    "Little time was allowed him for conjecture.",
    "After he had been helped to mount several stone steps, upon the last of which he was told to leave his sandals, a woman’s hand guided him along interminable reaches of polished planking, and round pillared angles too many to remember, and over widths amazing of matted floor,—into",
    "the middle of some vast apartment.",
    "There he thought that many great people were assembled: the sound of the rustling of silk was like the sound of leaves in a forest.",
    "He heard also a great humming of voices,—talking in undertones; and the speech was the speech of courts.",
    "Hōïchi was told to put himself at ease, and he found a kneeling-cushion ready for him.",
    "After having taken his place upon it, and tuned his instrument, the voice of a woman—whom he divined to be the _Rōjo_, or matron in charge of the female service—addressed him, saying,— “It is now required that the history of the Heiké be recited, to the accompaniment of the biwa.”",
    "Now the entire recital would have required a time of many nights: therefore Hōïchi ventured a question:— “As the whole of the story is not soon told, what portion is it augustly desired that I now recite?”",
    "The woman’s voice made answer:— “Recite the story of the battle at Dan-no-ura,—for the pity of it is the most deep.",
    "”[5]",
    "Then Hōïchi lifted up his voice, and chanted the chant of the fight on the bitter sea,—wonderfully making his biwa to sound like the straining of oars and the rushing of ships, the whirr and the hissing of arrows, the shouting and trampling of men, the crashing of steel upon helmets, the plunging of slain in the flood.",
    "And to left and right of him, in the pauses of his playing, he could hear voices murmuring praise: “How marvelous an artist!”—“Never in our own province was playing heard like this!”—“Not in all the empire is there another singer like Hōïchi!”",
    "Then fresh courage came to him, and he played and sang yet better than before; and a hush of wonder deepened about him.",
    "But when at last he came to tell the fate of the fair and helpless,—the piteous perishing of the women and children,—and the death-leap of Nii-no-Ama, with the imperial infant in her arms,—then all the listeners uttered together one long, long shuddering cry of anguish; and thereafter they wept and wailed so loudly and so wildly that the blind man was frightened by the violence and grief that he had made.",
    "For much time the sobbing and the wailing continued.",
    "But gradually the sounds of lamentation died away; and again, in the great stillness that followed, Hōïchi heard the voice of the woman whom he supposed to be the Rōjo.",
    "She said:— “Although we had been assured that you were a very skillful player upon the biwa, and without an equal in recitative, we did not know that any one could be so skillful as you have proved yourself to-night.",
    "Our lord has been pleased to say that he intends to bestow upon you a fitting reward.",
    "But he desires that you shall perform before him once every night for the next six nights—after which time he will probably make his august return-journey.",
    "To-morrow night, therefore, you are to come here at the same hour.",
    "The retainer who to-night conducted you will be sent for you...",
    "There is another matter about which I have been ordered to inform you.",
    "It is required that you shall speak to no one of your visits here, during the time of our lord’s august sojourn at Akamagaséki.",
    "As he is traveling incognito,[6] he commands that no mention of these things be made...",
    "You are now free to go back to your temple.”",
    "After Hōïchi had duly expressed his thanks, a woman’s hand conducted him to the entrance of the house, where the same retainer, who had before guided him, was waiting to take him home.",
    "The retainer led him to the verandah at the rear of the temple, and there bade him farewell.",
    "It was almost dawn when Hōïchi returned; but his absence from the temple had not been observed,—as the priest, coming back at a very late hour, had supposed him asleep.",
    "During the day Hōïchi was able to take some rest; and he said nothing about his strange adventure.",
    "In the middle of the following night the samurai again came for him, and led him to the august assembly, where he gave another recitation with the same success that had attended his previous performance.",
    "But during this second visit his absence from the temple was accidentally discovered; and after his return in the morning he was summoned to the presence of the priest, who said to him, in a tone of kindly reproach:— “We have been very anxious about you, friend Hōïchi.",
    "To go out, blind and alone, at so late an hour, is dangerous.",
    "Why did you go without telling us?",
    "I could have ordered a servant to accompany you.",
    "And where have you been?”",
    "Hōïchi answered, evasively,— “Pardon me kind friend!",
    "I had to attend to some private business; and I could not arrange the matter at any other hour.”",
    "The priest was surprised, rather than pained, by Hōïchi’s reticence: he felt it to be unnatural, and suspected something wrong.",
    "He feared that the blind lad had been bewitched or deluded by some evil spirits.",
    "He did not ask any more questions; but he privately instructed the men-servants of the temple to keep watch upon Hōïchi’s movements, and to follow him in case that he should again leave the temple after dark.",
    "On the very next night, Hōïchi was seen to leave the temple; and the servants immediately lighted their lanterns, and followed after him.",
    "But it was a rainy night, and very dark; and before the temple-folks could get to the roadway, Hōïchi had disappeared.",
    "Evidently he had walked very fast,—a strange thing, considering his blindness; for the road was in a bad condition.",
    "The men hurried through the streets, making inquiries at every house which Hōïchi was accustomed to visit; but nobody could give them any news of him.",
    "At last, as they were returning to the temple by way of the shore, they were startled by the sound of a biwa, furiously played, in the cemetery of the Amidaji.",
    "Except for some ghostly fires—such as usually flitted there on dark nights—all was blackness in that direction.",
    "But the men at once hastened to the cemetery; and there, by the help of their lanterns, they discovered Hōïchi,—sitting alone in the rain before the memorial tomb of Antoku Tennō, making his biwa resound, and loudly chanting the chant of the battle of Dan-no-ura.",
    "And behind him, and about him, and everywhere above the tombs, the fires of the dead were burning, like candles.",
    "Never before had so great a host of _Oni-bi_ appeared in the sight of mortal man...",
    "“Hōïchi San!—Hōïchi San!”",
    "the servants cried,—“you are bewitched!...",
    "Hōïchi San!”",
    "But the blind man did not seem to hear.",
    "Strenuously he made his biwa to rattle and ring and clang;—more and more wildly he chanted the chant of the battle of Dan-no-ura.",
    "They caught hold of him;—they shouted into his ear,— “Hōïchi San!—Hōïchi San!—come home with us at once!”",
    "Reprovingly he spoke to them:— “To interrupt me in such a manner, before this august assembly, will not be tolerated.”",
    "Whereat, in spite of the weirdness of the thing, the servants could not help laughing.",
    "Sure that he had been bewitched, they now seized him, and pulled him up on his feet, and by main force hurried him back to the temple,—where he was immediately relieved of his wet clothes, by order of the priest.",
    "Then the priest insisted upon a full explanation of his friend’s astonishing behavior.",
    "Hōïchi long hesitated to speak.",
    "But at last, finding that his conduct had really alarmed and angered the good priest, he decided to abandon his reserve; and he related everything that had happened from the time of first visit of the samurai.",
    "The priest said:— “Hōïchi, my poor friend, you are now in great danger!",
    "How unfortunate that you did not tell me all this before!",
    "Your wonderful skill in music has indeed brought you into strange trouble.",
    "By this time you must be aware that you have not been visiting any house whatever, but have been passing your nights in the cemetery, among the tombs of the Heiké;—and it was before the memorial-tomb of Antoku Tennō that our people to-night found you, sitting in the rain.",
    "All that you have been imagining was illusion—except the calling of the dead.",
    "By once obeying them, you have put yourself in their power.",
    "If you obey them again, after what has already occurred, they will tear you in pieces.",
    "But they would have destroyed you, sooner or later, in any event...",
    "Now I shall not be able to remain with you to-night: I am called away to perform another service.",
    "But, before I go, it will be necessary to protect your body by writing holy texts upon it.”",
    "Before sundown the priest and his acolyte stripped Hōïchi: then, with their writing-brushes, they traced upon his breast and back, head and face and neck, limbs and hands and feet,—even upon the soles of his feet, and upon all parts of his body,—the text of the holy sûtra called _Hannya-Shin-Kyō_.[7] When this had been done, the priest instructed Hōïchi, saying:— “To-night, as soon as I go away, you must seat yourself on the verandah, and wait.",
    "You will be called.",
    "But, whatever may happen, do not answer, and do not move.",
    "Say nothing and sit still—as if meditating.",
    "If you stir, or make any noise, you will be torn asunder.",
    "Do not get frightened; and do not think of calling for help—because no help could save you.",
    "If you do exactly as I tell you, the danger will pass, and you will have nothing more to fear.”",
    "After dark the priest and the acolyte went away; and Hōïchi seated himself on the verandah, according to the instructions given him.",
    "He laid his biwa on the planking beside him, and, assuming the attitude of meditation, remained quite still,—taking care not to cough, or to breathe audibly.",
    "For hours he stayed thus.",
    "Then, from the roadway, he heard the steps coming.",
    "They passed the gate, crossed the garden, approached the verandah, stopped—directly in front of him.",
    "“Hōïchi!”",
    "the deep voice called.",
    "But the blind man held his breath, and sat motionless.",
    "“Hōïchi!” grimly called the voice a second time.",
    "Then a third time—savagely:— “Hōïchi!”",
    "Hōïchi remained as still as a stone,—and the voice grumbled:— “No answer!—that won’t do!...",
    "Must see where the fellow is.”",
    "...",
    "There was a noise of heavy feet mounting upon the verandah.",
    "The feet approached deliberately,—halted beside him.",
    "Then, for long minutes,—during which Hōïchi felt his whole body shake to the beating of his heart,—there was dead silence.",
    "At last the gruff voice muttered close to him:— “Here is the biwa; but of the biwa-player I see—only two ears!...",
    "So that explains why he did not answer: he had no mouth to answer with—there is nothing left of him but his ears...",
    "Now to my lord those ears I will take—in proof that the august commands have been obeyed, so far as was possible”...",
    "At that instant Hōïchi felt his ears gripped by fingers of iron, and torn off!",
    "Great as the pain was, he gave no cry.",
    "The heavy footfalls receded along the verandah,—descended into the garden,—passed out to the roadway,—ceased.",
    "From either side of his head, the blind man felt a thick warm trickling; but he dared not lift his hands...",
    "Before sunrise the priest came back.",
    "He hastened at once to the verandah in the rear, stepped and slipped upon something clammy, and uttered a cry of horror;—for he saw, by the light of his lantern, that the clamminess was blood.",
    "But he perceived Hōïchi sitting there, in the attitude of meditation—with the blood still oozing from his wounds.",
    "“My poor Hōïchi!” cried the startled priest,—“what is this?...",
    "You have been hurt?”",
    "At the sound of his friend’s voice, the blind man felt safe.",
    "He burst out sobbing, and tearfully told his adventure of the night.",
    "“Poor, poor Hōïchi!”",
    "the priest exclaimed,—“all my fault!—my very grievous fault!...",
    "Everywhere upon your body the holy texts had been written—except upon your ears!",
    "I trusted my acolyte to do that part of the work; and it was very, very wrong of me not to have made sure that he had done it!...",
    "Well, the matter cannot now be helped;—we can only try to heal your hurts as soon as possible...",
    "Cheer up, friend!—the danger is now well over.",
    "You will never again be troubled by those visitors.”",
    "With the aid of a good doctor, Hōïchi soon recovered from his injuries.",
    "The story of his strange adventure spread far and wide, and soon made him famous.",
    "Many noble persons went to Akamagaséki to hear him recite; and large presents of money were given to him,—so that he became a wealthy man...",
    "But from the time of his adventure, he was known only by the appellation of _Mimi-nashi-Hōïchi:_",
    "“Hōïchi-the-Earless.”",
    "OSHIDORI There was a falconer and hunter, named Sonjō, who lived in the district called Tamura-no-Gō, of the province of Mutsu.",
    "One day he went out hunting, and could not find any game.",
    "But on his way home, at a place called Akanuma, he perceived a pair of _oshidori_[1] (mandarin-ducks), swimming together in a river that he was about to cross.",
    "To kill _oshidori_ is not good; but Sonjō happened to be very hungry, and he shot at the pair.",
    "His arrow pierced the male: the female escaped into the rushes of the further shore, and disappeared.",
    "Sonjō took the dead bird home, and cooked it.",
    "That night he dreamed a dreary dream.",
    "It seemed to him that a beautiful woman came into his room, and stood by his pillow, and began to weep.",
    "So bitterly did she weep that Sonjō felt as if his heart were being torn out while he listened.",
    "And the woman cried to him: “Why,—oh!",
    "why did you kill him?—of",
    "what wrong was he guilty?...",
    "At Akanuma we were so happy together,—and you killed him!...",
    "What harm did he ever do you?",
    "Do you even know what you have done?—oh!",
    "do you know what a cruel, what a wicked thing you have done?...",
    "Me too you have killed,—for I will not live without my husband!...",
    "Only to tell you this I came.”",
    "...",
    "Then again she wept aloud,—so bitterly that the voice of her crying pierced into the marrow of the listener’s bones;—and she sobbed out the words of this poem:— Hi kururéba Sasoëshi mono wo— Akanuma",
    "no Makomo no kuré no Hitori-né zo uki!",
    "[_“At the coming of twilight I invited him to return with me—!",
    "Now to sleep alone in the shadow of the rushes of Akanuma—ah!",
    "what misery unspeakable!”_][2]",
    "And after having uttered these verses she exclaimed:—“Ah, you do not know—you cannot know what you have done!",
    "But to-morrow, when you go to Akanuma, you will see,—you will see...”",
    "So saying, and weeping very piteously, she went away.",
    "When Sonjō awoke in the morning, this dream remained so vivid in his mind that he was greatly troubled.",
    "He remembered the words:—“But to-morrow, when you go to Akanuma, you will see,—you will see.”",
    "And he resolved to go there at once, that he might learn whether his dream was anything more than a dream.",
    "So he went to Akanuma; and there, when he came to the river-bank, he saw the female _oshidori_ swimming alone.",
    "In the same moment the bird perceived Sonjō; but, instead of trying to escape, she swam straight towards him, looking at him the while in a strange fixed way.",
    "Then, with her beak, she suddenly tore open her own body, and died before the hunter’s eyes...",
    "Sonjō shaved his head, and became a priest.",
    "THE STORY OF O-TEI A long time ago, in the town of Niigata, in the province of Echizen, there lived a man called Nagao Chōsei.",
    "Nagao was the son of a physician, and was educated for his father’s profession.",
    "At an early age he had been betrothed to a girl called O-Tei, the daughter of one of his father’s friends; and both families had agreed that the wedding should take place as soon as Nagao had finished his studies.",
    "But the health of O-Tei proved to be weak; and in her fifteenth year she was attacked by a fatal consumption.",
    "When she became aware that she must die, she sent for Nagao to bid him farewell.",
    "As he knelt at her bedside, she said to him:— “Nagao-Sama, (1) my betrothed, we were promised to each other from the time of our childhood; and we were to have been married at the end of this year.",
    "But now I am going to die;—the gods know what is best for us.",
    "If I were able to live for some years longer, I could only continue to be a cause of trouble and grief for others.",
    "With this frail body, I could not be a good wife; and therefore even to wish to live, for your sake, would be a very selfish wish.",
    "I am quite resigned to die; and I want you to promise that you will not grieve...",
    "Besides, I want to tell you that I think we shall meet again.”...",
    "“Indeed we shall meet again,” Nagao answered earnestly.",
    "“And in that Pure Land (2) there will be no pain of separation.”",
    "“Nay, nay!”",
    "she responded softly, “I meant not the Pure Land.",
    "I believe that we are destined to meet again in this world,—although",
    "I shall be buried to-morrow.”",
    "Nagao looked at her wonderingly, and saw her smile at his wonder.",
    "She continued, in her gentle, dreamy voice,— “Yes, I mean in this world,—in your own present life, Nagao-Sama... Providing, indeed, that you wish it.",
    "Only, for this thing to happen, I must again be born a girl, and grow up to womanhood.",
    "So you would have to wait.",
    "Fifteen—sixteen years: that is a long time...",
    "But, my promised husband, you are now only nineteen years old.”...",
    "Eager to soothe her dying moments, he answered tenderly:— “To wait for you, my betrothed, were no less a joy than a duty.",
    "We are pledged to each other for the time of seven existences.”",
    "“But you doubt?”",
    "she questioned, watching his face.",
    "“My dear one,” he answered, “I doubt whether I should be able to know you in another body, under another",
    "name,—unless you can tell me of a sign or token.”",
    "“That I cannot do,” she said.",
    "“Only the Gods and the Buddhas know how and where we shall meet.",
    "But I am sure—very, very sure—that, if you be not unwilling to receive me, I shall be able to come back to you...",
    "Remember these words of mine.”...",
    "She ceased to speak; and her eyes closed.",
    "She was dead.",
    "Nagao had been sincerely attached to O-Tei; and his grief was deep.",
    "He had a mortuary tablet made, inscribed with her _zokumyō;_[1] and he placed the tablet in his _butsudan_,[2] and every day set offerings before it.",
    "He thought a great deal about the strange things that O-Tei had said to him just before her death; and, in the hope of pleasing her spirit, he wrote a solemn promise to wed her if she could ever return to him in another body.",
    "This written promise he sealed with his seal, and placed in the _butsudan_ beside the mortuary tablet of O-Tei.",
    "Nevertheless, as Nagao was an only son, it was necessary that he should marry.",
    "He soon found himself obliged to yield to the wishes of his family, and to accept a wife of his father’s choosing.",
    "After his marriage he continued to set offerings before the tablet of O-Tei; and he never failed to remember her with affection.",
    "But by degrees her image became dim in his memory,—like a dream that is hard to recall.",
    "And the years went by.",
    "During those years many misfortunes came upon him.",
    "He lost his parents by death,—then his wife and his only child.",
    "So that he found himself alone in the world.",
    "He abandoned his desolate home, and set out upon a long journey in the hope of forgetting his sorrows.",
    "One day, in the course of his travels, he arrived at Ikao,—a mountain-village still famed for its thermal springs, and for the beautiful scenery of its neighborhood.",
    "In the village-inn at which he stopped, a young girl came to wait upon him; and, at the first sight of her face, he felt his heart leap as it had never leaped before.",
    "So strangely did she resemble O-Tei that he pinched himself to make sure that he was not dreaming.",
    "As she went and came,—bringing fire and food, or arranging the chamber of the guest,—her every attitude and motion revived in him some gracious memory of the girl to whom he had been pledged in his youth.",
    "He spoke to her; and she responded in a soft, clear voice of which the sweetness saddened him with a sadness of other days.",
    "Then, in great wonder, he questioned her, saying:— “Elder Sister (3), so much do you look like a person whom I knew long ago, that I was startled when you first entered this room.",
    "Pardon me, therefore, for asking what is your native place, and what is your name?”",
    "Immediately,—and in the unforgotten voice of the dead,—she thus made answer:— “My name is O-Tei; and you are Nagao Chōsei of Echigo, my promised husband.",
    "Seventeen years ago, I died in Niigata: then you made in writing a promise to marry me if ever I could come back to this world in the body of a woman;—and you sealed that written promise with your seal, and put it in the _butsudan_, beside the tablet inscribed with my name.",
    "And therefore I came back.”...",
    "As she uttered these last words, she fell unconscious.",
    "Nagao married her; and the marriage was a happy one.",
    "But at no time afterwards could she remember what she had told him in answer to his question at Ikao: neither could she remember anything of her previous existence.",
    "The recollection of the former birth,—mysteriously kindled in the moment of that meeting,—had again become obscured, and so thereafter remained.",
    "UBAZAKURA Three hundred years ago, in the village called Asamimura, in the district called Onsengōri, in the province of Iyō, there lived a good man named Tokubei.",
    "This Tokubei was the richest person in the district, and the _muraosa_, or headman, of the village.",
    "In most matters he was fortunate; but he reached the age of forty without knowing the happiness of becoming a father.",
    "Therefore he and his wife, in the affliction of their childlessness, addressed many prayers to the divinity Fudō Myō Ō, who had a famous temple, called Saihōji, in Asamimura.",
    "At last their prayers were heard: the wife of Tokubei gave birth to a daughter.",
    "The child was very pretty; and she received the name of Tsuyu.",
    "As the mother’s milk was deficient, a milk-nurse, called O-Sodé, was hired for the little one.",
    "O-Tsuyu grew up to be a very beautiful girl; but at the age of fifteen she fell sick, and the doctors thought that she was going to die.",
    "In that time the nurse O-Sodé, who loved O-Tsuyu with a real mother’s love, went to the temple Saihōji, and fervently prayed to Fudō-Sama on behalf of the girl.",
    "Every day, for twenty-one days, she went to the temple and prayed; and at the end of that time, O-Tsuyu suddenly and completely recovered.",
    "Then there was great rejoicing in the house of Tokubei; and he gave a feast to all his friends in celebration of the happy event.",
    "But on the night of the feast the nurse O-Sodé was suddenly taken ill; and on the following morning, the doctor, who had been summoned to attend her, announced that she was dying.",
    "Then the family, in great sorrow, gathered about her bed, to bid her farewell.",
    "But she said to them:— “It is time that I should tell you something which you do not know.",
    "My prayer has been heard.",
    "I besought Fudō-Sama that I might be permitted to die in the place of O-Tsuyu; and this great favor has been granted me.",
    "Therefore you must not grieve about my death...",
    "But I have one request to make.",
    "I promised Fudō-Sama that I would have a cherry-tree planted in the garden of Saihōji, for a thank-offering and a commemoration.",
    "Now I shall not be able myself to plant the tree there: so I must beg that you will fulfill that vow for me...",
    "Good-bye, dear friends; and remember that I was happy to die for O-Tsuyu’s sake.”",
    "After the funeral of O-Sodé, a young cherry-tree,—the finest that could be found,—was planted in the garden of Saihōji by the parents of O-Tsuyu.",
    "The tree grew and flourished; and on the sixteenth day of the second month of the following year,—the anniversary of O-Sodé’s death,—it blossomed in a wonderful way.",
    "So it continued to blossom for two hundred and fifty-four years,—always upon the sixteenth day of the second month;—and its flowers, pink and white, were like the nipples of a woman’s breasts, bedewed with milk.",
    "And the people called it _Ubazakura_, the Cherry-tree of the Milk-Nurse.",
    "DIPLOMACY",
    "It had been ordered that the execution should take place in the garden of the _yashiki_ (1).",
    "So the man was taken there, and made to kneel down in a wide sanded space crossed by a line of _tobi-ishi_, or stepping-stones, such as you may still see in Japanese landscape-gardens.",
    "His arms were bound behind him.",
    "Retainers brought water in buckets, and rice-bags filled with pebbles; and they packed the rice-bags round the kneeling man,—so wedging him in that he could not move.",
    "The master came, and observed the arrangements.",
    "He found them satisfactory, and made no remarks.",
    "Suddenly the condemned man cried out to him:— “Honored Sir, the fault for which I have been doomed I did not wittingly commit.",
    "It was only my very great stupidity which caused the fault.",
    "Having been born stupid, by reason of my Karma, I could not always help making mistakes.",
    "But to kill a man for being stupid is wrong,—and that wrong will be repaid.",
    "So surely as you kill me, so surely shall I be avenged;—out of the resentment that you provoke will come the vengeance; and evil will be rendered for evil.”...",
    "If any person be killed while feeling strong resentment, the ghost of that person will be able to take vengeance upon the killer.",
    "This the samurai knew.",
    "He replied very gently,—almost caressingly:— “We shall allow you to frighten us as much as you please—after you are dead.",
    "But it is difficult to believe that you mean what you say.",
    "Will you try to give us some sign of your great resentment—after your head has been cut off?”",
    "“Assuredly I will,” answered the man.",
    "“Very well,” said the samurai, drawing his long sword;—“I am now going to cut off your head.",
    "Directly in front of you there is a stepping-stone.",
    "After your head has been cut off, try to bite the stepping-stone.",
    "If your angry ghost can help you to do that, some of us may be frightened...",
    "Will you try to bite the stone?”",
    "“I will bite it!”",
    "cried the man, in great anger,—“I will bite it!—I will bite”— There was a flash, a swish, a crunching thud: the bound body bowed over the rice sacks,—two long blood-jets pumping from the shorn neck;—and the head rolled upon the sand.",
    "Heavily toward the stepping-stone it rolled: then, suddenly bounding, it caught the upper edge of the stone between its teeth, clung desperately for a moment, and dropped inert.",
    "None spoke; but the retainers stared in horror at their master.",
    "He seemed to be quite unconcerned.",
    "He merely held out his sword to the nearest attendant, who, with a wooden dipper, poured water over the blade from haft to point, and then carefully wiped the steel several times with sheets of soft paper...",
    "And thus ended the ceremonial part of the incident.",
    "For months thereafter, the retainers and the domestics lived in ceaseless fear of ghostly visitation.",
    "None of them doubted that the promised vengeance would come; and their constant terror caused them to hear and to see much that did not exist.",
    "They became afraid of the sound of the wind in the bamboos,—afraid even of the stirring of shadows in the garden.",
    "At last, after taking counsel together, they decided to petition their master to have a _Ségaki_-service (2) performed on behalf of the vengeful spirit.",
    "“Quite unnecessary,” the samurai said, when his chief retainer had uttered the general wish...",
    "“I understand that the desire of a dying man for revenge may be a cause for fear.",
    "But in this case there is nothing to fear.”",
    "The retainer looked at his master beseechingly, but hesitated to ask the reason of the alarming confidence.",
    "“Oh, the reason is simple enough,” declared the samurai, divining the unspoken doubt.",
    "“Only the very last intention of the fellow could have been dangerous; and when I challenged him to give me the sign, I diverted his mind from the desire of revenge.",
    "He died with the set purpose of biting the stepping-stone; and that purpose he was able to accomplish, but nothing else.",
    "All the rest he must have forgotten...",
    "So you need not feel any further anxiety about the matter.”",
    "—And indeed the dead man gave no more trouble.",
    "Nothing at all happened.",
    "OF A MIRROR AND A BELL Eight centuries ago, the priests of Mugenyama, in the province of Tōtōmi (1), wanted a big bell for their temple; and they asked the women of their parish to help them by contributing old bronze mirrors for bell-metal.",
    "[Even to-day, in the courts of certain Japanese temples, you may see heaps of old bronze mirrors contributed for such a purpose.",
    "The largest collection of this kind that I ever saw was in the court of a temple of the Jōdo sect, at Hakata, in Kyūshū: the mirrors had been given for the making of a bronze statue of Amida, thirty-three feet high.]",
    "There was at that time a young woman, a farmer’s wife, living at Mugenyama, who presented her mirror to the temple, to be used for bell-metal.",
    "But afterwards she much regretted her mirror.",
    "She remembered things that her mother had told her about it; and she remembered that it had belonged, not only to her mother but to her mother’s mother and grandmother; and she remembered some happy smiles which it had reflected.",
    "Of course, if she could have offered the priests a certain sum of money in place of the mirror, she could have asked them to give back her heirloom.",
    "But she had not the money necessary.",
    "Whenever she went to the temple, she saw her mirror lying in the court-yard, behind a railing, among hundreds of other mirrors heaped there together.",
    "She knew it by the _Shō-Chiku-Bai_ in relief on the back of it,—those three fortunate emblems of Pine, Bamboo, and Plumflower, which delighted her baby-eyes when her mother first showed her the mirror.",
    "She longed for some chance to steal the mirror, and hide it,—that she might thereafter treasure it always.",
    "But the chance did not come; and she became very unhappy,—felt as if she had foolishly given away a part of her life.",
    "She thought about the old saying that a mirror is the Soul of a Woman—(a saying mystically expressed, by the Chinese character for Soul, upon the backs of many bronze mirrors),—and",
    "she feared that it was true in weirder ways than she had before imagined.",
    "But she could not dare to speak of her pain to anybody.",
    "Now, when all the mirrors contributed for the Mugenyama bell had been sent to the foundry, the bell-founders discovered that there was one mirror among them which would not melt.",
    "Again and again they tried to melt it; but it resisted all their efforts.",
    "Evidently the woman who had given that mirror to the temple must have regretted the giving.",
    "She had not presented her offering with all her heart; and therefore her selfish soul, remaining attached to the mirror, kept it hard and cold in the midst of the furnace.",
    "Of course everybody heard of the matter, and everybody soon knew whose mirror it was that would not melt.",
    "And because of this public exposure of her secret fault, the poor woman became very much ashamed and very angry.",
    "And as she could not bear the shame, she drowned herself, after having written a farewell letter containing these words:— “When I am dead, it will not be difficult to melt the mirror and to cast the bell.",
    "But, to the person who breaks that bell by ringing it, great wealth will be given by the ghost of me.”",
    "—You must know that the last wish or promise of anybody who dies in anger, or performs suicide in anger, is generally supposed to possess a supernatural force.",
    "After the dead woman’s mirror had been melted, and the bell had been successfully cast, people remembered the words of that letter.",
    "They felt sure that the spirit of the writer would give wealth to the breaker of the bell; and, as soon as the bell had been suspended in the court of the temple, they went in multitude to ring it.",
    "With all their might and main they swung the ringing-beam; but the bell proved to be a good bell, and it bravely withstood their assaults.",
    "Nevertheless, the people were not easily discouraged.",
    "Day after day, at all hours, they continued to ring the bell furiously,—caring nothing whatever for the protests of the priests.",
    "So the ringing became an affliction; and the priests could not endure it; and they got rid of the bell by rolling it down the hill into a swamp.",
    "The swamp was deep, and swallowed it",
    "up,—and that was the end of the bell.",
    "Only its legend remains; and in that legend it is called the _Mugen-Kané_, or Bell of Mugen.",
    "Now there are queer old Japanese beliefs in the magical efficacy of a certain mental operation implied, though not described, by the verb _nazoraëru_.",
    "The word itself cannot be adequately rendered by any English word; for it is used in relation to many kinds of mimetic magic, as well as in relation to the performance of many religious acts of faith.",
    "Common meanings of _nazoraëru_, according to dictionaries, are “to imitate,” “to compare,” “to liken;” but the esoteric meaning is _to substitute, in imagination, one object or action for another, so as to bring about some magical or miraculous result_.",
    "For example:—you cannot afford to build a Buddhist temple; but you can easily lay a pebble before the image of the Buddha, with the same pious feeling that would prompt you to build a temple if you were rich enough to build one.",
    "The merit of so offering the pebble becomes equal, or almost equal, to the merit of erecting a temple...",
    "You cannot read the six thousand seven hundred and seventy-one volumes of the Buddhist texts; but you can make a revolving library, containing them, turn round, by pushing it like a windlass.",
    "And if you push with an earnest wish that you could read the six thousand seven hundred and seventy-one volumes, you will acquire the same merit as the reading of them would enable you to gain...",
    "So much will perhaps suffice to explain the religious meanings of _nazoraëru_.",
    "The magical meanings could not all be explained without a great variety of examples; but, for present purposes, the following will serve.",
    "If you should make a little man of straw, for the same reason that Sister Helen made a little man of wax,—and nail it, with nails not less than five inches long, to some tree in a temple-grove at the Hour of the Ox (2),—and if the person, imaginatively represented by that little straw man, should die thereafter in atrocious agony,—that would illustrate one signification of _nazoraëru_...",
    "Or, let us suppose that a robber has entered your house during the night, and carried away your valuables.",
    "If you can discover the footprints of that robber in your garden, and then promptly burn a very large moxa on each of them, the soles of the feet of the robber will become inflamed, and will allow him no rest until he returns, of his own accord, to put himself at your mercy.",
    "That is another kind of mimetic magic expressed by the term _nazoraëru_.",
    "And a third kind is illustrated by various legends of the Mugen-Kané.",
    "After the bell had been rolled into the swamp, there was, of course, no more chance of ringing it in such wise as to break it.",
    "But persons who regretted this loss of opportunity would strike and break objects imaginatively substituted for the bell,—thus hoping to please the spirit of the owner of the mirror that had made so much trouble.",
    "One of these persons was a woman called Umégaë,—famed in Japanese legend because of her relation to Kajiwara Kagesue, a warrior of the Heiké clan.",
    "While the pair were traveling together, Kajiwara one day found himself in great straits for want of money; and Umégaë, remembering the tradition of the Bell of Mugen, took a basin of bronze, and, mentally representing it to be the bell, beat upon it until she broke it,—crying out, at the same time, for three hundred pieces of gold.",
    "A guest of the inn where the pair were stopping made inquiry as to the cause of the banging and the crying, and, on learning the story of the trouble, actually presented Umégaë with three hundred _ryō_ (3) in gold.",
    "Afterwards a song was made about Umégaë’s basin of bronze; and that song is sung by dancing girls even to this day:— Umégaë no chōzubachi tataïté O-kané ga déru naraba Mina San mi-uké wo Sōré tanomimasu",
    "[“_If, by striking upon the wash-basin of Umégaë, I could make honorable money come to me, then would I negotiate for the freedom of all my girl-comrades._”]",
    "After this happening, the fame of the Mugen-Kané became great; and many people followed the example of Umégaë,—thereby hoping to emulate her luck.",
    "Among these folk was a dissolute farmer who lived near Mugenyama, on the bank of the Ōïgawa.",
    "Having wasted his substance in riotous living, this farmer made for himself, out of the mud in his garden, a clay-model of the Mugen-Kané; and he beat the clay-bell, and broke it,—crying out the while for great wealth.",
    "Then, out of the ground before him, rose up the figure of a white-robed woman, with long loose-flowing hair, holding a covered jar.",
    "And the woman said: “I have come to answer your fervent prayer as it deserves to be answered.",
    "Take, therefore, this jar.”",
    "So saying, she put the jar into his hands, and disappeared.",
    "Into his house the happy man rushed, to tell his wife the good news.",
    "He set down in front of her the covered jar,—which was heavy,—and they opened it together.",
    "And they found that it was filled, up to the very brim, with...",
    "But no!—I really cannot tell you with what it was filled.",
    "JIKININKI",
    "Once, when Musō Kokushi, a priest of the Zen sect, was journeying alone through the province of Mino (1), he lost his way in a mountain-district where there was nobody to direct him.",
    "For a long time he wandered about helplessly; and he was beginning to despair of finding shelter for the night, when he perceived, on the top of a hill lighted by the last rays of the sun, one of those little hermitages, called _anjitsu_, which are built for solitary priests.",
    "It seemed to be in ruinous condition; but he hastened to it eagerly, and found that it was inhabited by an aged priest, from whom he begged the favor of a night’s lodging.",
    "This the old man harshly refused; but he directed Musō to a certain hamlet, in the valley adjoining where lodging and food could be obtained.",
    "Musō found his way to the hamlet, which consisted of less than a dozen farm-cottages; and he was kindly received at the dwelling of the headman.",
    "Forty or fifty persons were assembled in the principal apartment, at the moment of Musō’s arrival; but he was shown into a small separate room, where he was promptly supplied with food and bedding.",
    "Being very tired, he lay down to rest at an early hour; but a little before midnight he was roused from sleep by a sound of loud weeping in the next apartment.",
    "Presently the sliding-screens were gently pushed apart; and a young man, carrying a lighted lantern, entered the room, respectfully saluted him, and said:— “Reverend Sir, it is my painful duty to tell you that I am now the responsible head of this house.",
    "Yesterday I was only the eldest son.",
    "But when you came here, tired as you were, we did not wish that you should feel embarrassed in any way: therefore we did not tell you that father had died only a few hours before.",
    "The people whom you saw in the next room are the inhabitants of this village: they all assembled here to pay their last respects to the dead; and now they are going to another village, about three miles off,—for by our custom, no one of us may remain in this village during the night after a death has taken place.",
    "We make the proper offerings and prayers;—then we go away, leaving the corpse alone.",
    "Strange things always happen in the house where a corpse has thus been left: so we think that it will be better for you to come away with us.",
    "We can find you good lodging in the other village.",
    "But perhaps, as you are a priest, you have no fear of demons or evil spirits; and, if you are not afraid of being left alone with the body, you will be very welcome to the use of this poor house.",
    "However, I must tell you that nobody, except a priest, would dare to remain here tonight.”",
    "Musō made answer:— “For your kind intention and your generous hospitality, I am deeply grateful.",
    "But I am sorry that you did not tell me of your father’s death when I came;—for, though I was a little tired, I certainly was not so tired that I should have found difficulty in doing my duty as a priest.",
    "Had you told me, I could have performed the service before your departure.",
    "As it is, I shall perform the service after you have gone away; and I shall stay by the body until morning.",
    "I do not know what you mean by your words about the danger of staying here alone; but I am not afraid of ghosts or demons: therefore please to feel no anxiety on my account.”",
    "The young man appeared to be rejoiced by these assurances, and expressed his gratitude in fitting words.",
    "Then the other members of the family, and the folk assembled in the adjoining room, having been told of the priest’s kind promises, came to thank him,—after which the master of the house said:— “Now, reverend Sir, much as we regret to leave you alone, we must bid you farewell.",
    "By the rule of our village, none of us can stay here after midnight.",
    "We beg, kind Sir, that you will take every care of your honorable body, while we are unable to attend upon you.",
    "And if you happen to hear or see anything strange during our absence, please tell us of the matter when we return in the morning.”",
    "All then left the house, except the priest, who went to the room where the dead body was lying.",
    "The usual offerings had been set before the corpse; and a small Buddhist lamp—_tōmyō_—was burning.",
    "The priest recited the service, and performed the funeral ceremonies,—after which he entered into meditation.",
    "So meditating he remained through several silent hours; and there was no sound in the deserted village.",
    "But, when the hush of the night was at its deepest, there noiselessly entered a Shape, vague and vast; and in the same moment Musō found himself without power to move or speak.",
    "He saw that Shape lift the corpse, as with hands, devour it, more quickly than a cat devours a rat,—beginning at the head, and eating everything: the hair and the bones and even the shroud.",
    "And the monstrous Thing, having thus consumed the body, turned to the offerings, and ate them also.",
    "Then it went away, as mysteriously as it had come.",
    "When the villagers returned next morning, they found the priest awaiting them at the door of the headman’s dwelling.",
    "All in turn saluted him; and when they had entered, and looked about the room, no one expressed any surprise at the disappearance of the dead body and the offerings.",
    "But the master of the house said to Musō:— “Reverent Sir, you have probably seen unpleasant things during the night: all of us were anxious about you.",
    "But now we are very happy to find you alive and unharmed.",
    "Gladly we would have stayed with you, if it had been possible.",
    "But the law of our village, as I told you last evening, obliges us to quit our houses after a death has taken place, and to leave the corpse alone.",
    "Whenever this law has been broken, heretofore, some great misfortune has followed.",
    "Whenever it is obeyed, we find that the corpse and the offerings disappear during our absence.",
    "Perhaps you have seen the cause.”",
    "Then Musō told of the dim and awful Shape that had entered the death-chamber to devour the body and the offerings.",
    "No person seemed to be surprised by his narration; and the master of the house observed:— “What you have told us, reverend Sir, agrees with what has been said about this matter from ancient time.”",
    "Musō then inquired:— “Does not the priest on the hill sometimes perform the funeral service for your dead?”",
    "“What priest?”",
    "the young man asked.",
    "“The priest who yesterday evening directed me to this village,” answered Musō.",
    "“I called at his _anjitsu_ on the hill yonder.",
    "He refused me lodging, but told me the way here.”",
    "The listeners looked at each other, as in astonishment; and, after a moment of silence, the master of the house said:— “Reverend Sir, there is no priest and there is no _anjitsu_ on the hill.",
    "For the time of many generations there has not been any resident-priest in this neighborhood.”",
    "Musō said nothing more on the subject; for it was evident that his kind hosts supposed him to have been deluded by some goblin.",
    "But after having bidden them farewell, and obtained all necessary information as to his road, he determined to look again for the hermitage on the hill, and so to ascertain whether he had really been deceived.",
    "He found the _anjitsu_ without any difficulty; and, this time, its aged occupant invited him to enter.",
    "When he had done so, the hermit humbly bowed down before him, exclaiming:—“Ah!",
    "I am ashamed!—I am very much ashamed!—I am exceedingly ashamed!”",
    "“You need not be ashamed for having refused me shelter,” said Musō.",
    "“You directed me to the village yonder, where I was very kindly treated; and I thank you for that favor.”",
    "“I can give no man shelter,” the recluse made answer;—“and it is not for the refusal that I am ashamed.",
    "I am ashamed only that you should have seen me in my real shape,—for it was I who devoured the corpse and the offerings last night before your eyes...",
    "Know, reverend Sir, that I am a _jikininki_,[1]—an eater of human flesh.",
    "Have pity upon me, and suffer me to confess the secret fault by which I became reduced to this condition.",
    "“A long, long time ago, I was a priest in this desolate region.",
    "There was no other priest for many leagues around.",
    "So, in that time, the bodies of the mountain-folk who died used to be brought here,—sometimes from great distances,—in order that I might repeat over them the holy service.",
    "But I repeated the service and performed the rites only as a matter of business;—I thought only of the food and the clothes that my sacred profession enabled me to gain.",
    "And because of this selfish impiety I was reborn, immediately after my death, into the state of a _jikininki_.",
    "Since then I have been obliged to feed upon the corpses of the people who die in this district: every one of them I must devour in the way that you saw last night...",
    "Now, reverend Sir, let me beseech you to perform a Ségaki-service[2] for me: help me by your prayers, I entreat you, so that I may be soon able to escape from this horrible state of existence”...",
    "No sooner had the hermit uttered this petition than he disappeared; and the hermitage also disappeared at the same instant.",
    "And Musō Kokushi found himself kneeling alone in the high grass, beside an ancient and moss-grown tomb of the form called _go-rin-ishi_,[3] which seemed to be the tomb of a priest.",
    "MUJINA On the Akasaka Road, in Tōkyō, there is a slope called Kii-no-kuni-zaka,—which means the Slope of the Province of Kii.",
    "I do not know why it is called the Slope of the Province of Kii.",
    "On one side of this slope you see an ancient moat, deep and very wide, with high green banks rising up to some place of gardens;—and on the other side of the road extend the long and lofty walls of an imperial palace.",
    "Before the era of street-lamps and jinrikishas, this neighborhood was very lonesome after dark; and belated pedestrians would go miles out of their way rather than mount the Kii-no-kuni-zaka, alone, after sunset.",
    "All because of a Mujina that used to walk there.",
    "(1) The last man who saw the Mujina was an old merchant of the Kyōbashi quarter, who died about thirty years ago.",
    "This is the story, as he told it:— One night, at a late hour, he was hurrying up the Kii-no-kuni-zaka, when he perceived a woman crouching by the moat, all alone, and weeping bitterly.",
    "Fearing that she intended to drown herself, he stopped to offer her any assistance or consolation in his power.",
    "She appeared to be a slight and graceful person, handsomely dressed; and her hair was arranged like that of a young girl of good family.",
    "“O-jochū,”[1] he exclaimed, approaching her,—“O-jochū, do not cry like that!...",
    "Tell me what the trouble is; and if there be any way to help you, I shall be glad to help you.”",
    "(He really meant what he said; for he was a very kind man.)",
    "But she continued to weep,—hiding her face from him with one of her long sleeves.",
    "“O-jochū,” he said again, as gently as he could,—“please, please listen to me!...",
    "This is no place for a young lady at night!",
    "Do not cry, I implore you!—only tell me how I may be of some help to you!”",
    "Slowly she rose up, but turned her back to him, and continued to moan and sob behind her sleeve.",
    "He laid his hand lightly upon her shoulder, and pleaded:—“O-jochū!—O-jochū!—O-jochū!...",
    "Listen to me, just for one little moment!...",
    "O-jochū!—O-jochū!”",
    "...",
    "Then that O-jochū turned around, and dropped her sleeve, and stroked her face with",
    "her hand;—and the man saw that she had no eyes or nose or mouth,—and he screamed and ran away.",
    "(2) Up Kii-no-kuni-zaka he ran and ran; and all was black and empty before him.",
    "On and on he ran, never daring to look back; and at last he saw a lantern, so far away that it looked like the gleam of a firefly; and he made for it.",
    "It proved to be only the lantern of an itinerant _soba_-seller,[2] who had set down his stand by the road-side; but any light and any human companionship was good after that experience; and he flung himself down at the feet of the _soba_-seller, crying out, “Ah!—aa!!—_aa!!!_”...",
    "“_Koré! koré!_” (3) roughly exclaimed the soba-man.",
    "“Here!",
    "what is the matter with you?",
    "Anybody hurt you?”",
    "“No—nobody hurt me,” panted the other,—“only... _Ah!—aa!_”",
    "“—Only scared you?” queried the peddler, unsympathetically.",
    "“Robbers?”",
    "“Not robbers,—not robbers,” gasped the terrified man... “I saw...",
    "I saw a woman—by the moat;—and she showed me... _",
    "Ah!_",
    "I cannot tell you what she showed me!”...",
    "“_Hé!_ (4) Was it anything like THIS that she showed you?” cried the soba-man, stroking his own face—which therewith became like unto an Egg...",
    "And, simultaneously, the light went out.",
    "ROKURO-KUBI Nearly five hundred years ago there was a samurai, named Isogai Héïdazaëmon Takétsura, in the service of the Lord Kikuji, of Kyūshū.",
    "This Isogai had inherited, from many warlike ancestors, a natural aptitude for military exercises, and extraordinary strength.",
    "While yet a boy he had surpassed his teachers in the art of swordsmanship, in archery, and in the use of the spear, and had displayed all the capacities of a daring and skillful soldier.",
    "Afterwards, in the time of the Eikyō[1] war, he so distinguished himself that high honors were bestowed upon him.",
    "But when the house of Kikuji came to ruin, Isogai found himself without a master.",
    "He might then easily have obtained service under another daimyō; but as he had never sought distinction for his own sake alone, and as his heart remained true to his former lord, he preferred to give up the world.",
    "So he cut off his hair, and became a traveling priest,—taking the Buddhist name of Kwairyō.",
    "But always, under the _koromo_[2] of the priest, Kwairyō kept warm within him the heart of the samurai.",
    "As in other years he had laughed at peril, so now also he scorned danger; and in all weathers and all seasons he journeyed to preach the good Law in places where no other priest would have dared to go.",
    "For that age was an age of violence and disorder; and upon the highways there was no security for the solitary traveler, even if he happened to be a priest.",
    "In the course of his first long journey, Kwairyō had occasion to visit the province of Kai.",
    "(1) One evening, as he was traveling through the mountains of that province, darkness overcame him in a very lonesome district, leagues away from any village.",
    "So he resigned himself to pass the night under the stars; and having found a suitable grassy spot, by the roadside, he lay down there, and prepared to sleep.",
    "He had always welcomed discomfort; and even a bare rock was for him a good bed, when nothing better could be found, and the root of a pine-tree an excellent pillow.",
    "His body was iron; and he never troubled himself about dews or rain or frost or snow.",
    "Scarcely had he lain down when a man came along the road, carrying an axe and a great bundle of chopped wood.",
    "This woodcutter halted on seeing Kwairyō lying down, and, after a moment of silent observation, said to him in a tone of great surprise:— “What kind of a man can you be, good Sir, that you dare to lie down alone in such a place as this?...",
    "There are haunters about here,—many of them.",
    "Are you not afraid of Hairy Things?”",
    "“My friend,” cheerfully answered Kwairyō, “I am only a wandering priest,—a ‘Cloud-and-Water-Guest,’ as folks call it: _",
    "Unsui-no-ryokaku_.",
    "(2)",
    "And I am not in the least afraid of Hairy Things,—if you mean goblin-foxes, or goblin-badgers, or any creatures of that kind.",
    "As for lonesome places, I like them: they are suitable for meditation.",
    "I am accustomed to sleeping in the open air: and I have learned never to be anxious about my life.”",
    "“You must be indeed a brave man, Sir Priest,” the peasant responded, “to lie down here!",
    "This place has a bad name,—a very bad name.",
    "But, as the proverb has it, _Kunshi ayayuki ni chikayorazu_",
    "[‘The superior man does not needlessly expose himself to peril’]; and I must assure you, Sir, that it is very dangerous to sleep here.",
    "Therefore, although my house is only a wretched thatched hut, let me beg of you to come home with me at once.",
    "In the way of food, I have nothing to offer you; but there is a roof at least, and you can sleep under it without risk.”",
    "He spoke earnestly; and Kwairyō, liking the kindly tone of the man, accepted this modest offer.",
    "The woodcutter guided him along a narrow path, leading up from the main road through mountain-forest.",
    "It was a rough and dangerous path,—sometimes skirting precipices,—sometimes offering nothing but a network of slippery roots for the foot to rest upon,—sometimes winding over or between masses of jagged rock.",
    "But at last Kwairyō found himself upon a cleared space at the top of a hill, with a full moon shining overhead; and he saw before him a small thatched cottage, cheerfully lighted from within.",
    "The woodcutter led him to a shed at the back of the house, whither water had been conducted, through bamboo-pipes, from some neighboring stream; and the two men washed their feet.",
    "Beyond the shed was a vegetable garden, and a grove of cedars and bamboos; and beyond the trees appeared the glimmer of a cascade, pouring from some loftier height, and swaying in the moonshine like a long white robe.",
    "As Kwairyō entered the cottage with his guide, he perceived four persons—men and women—warming their hands at a little fire kindled in the _ro_[3] of the principle apartment.",
    "They bowed low to the priest, and greeted him in the most respectful manner.",
    "Kwairyō wondered that persons so poor, and dwelling in such a solitude, should be aware of the polite forms of greeting.",
    "“These are good people,” he thought to himself; “and they must have been taught by some one well acquainted with the rules of propriety.”",
    "Then turning to his host,—the _aruji_, or house-master, as the others called him,—Kwairyō said:— “From the kindness of your speech, and from the very polite welcome given me by your household, I imagine that you have not always been a woodcutter.",
    "Perhaps you formerly belonged to one of the upper classes?”",
    "Smiling, the woodcutter answered:— “Sir, you are not mistaken.",
    "Though now living as you find me, I was once a person of some distinction.",
    "My story is the story of a ruined life—ruined by my own fault.",
    "I used to be in the service of a daimyō; and my rank in that service was not inconsiderable.",
    "But I loved women and wine too well; and under the influence of passion I acted wickedly.",
    "My selfishness brought about the ruin of our house, and caused the death of many persons.",
    "Retribution followed me; and I long remained a fugitive in the land.",
    "Now I often pray that I may be able to make some atonement for the evil which I did, and to reestablish the ancestral home.",
    "But I fear that I shall never find any way of so doing.",
    "Nevertheless, I try to overcome the karma of my errors by sincere repentance, and by helping, as far as I can, those who are unfortunate.”",
    "Kwairyō was pleased by this announcement of good resolve; and he said to the _aruji:_— “My friend, I have had occasion to observe that men, prone to folly in their youth, may in after years become very earnest in right living.",
    "In the holy sûtras it is written that those strongest in wrong-doing can become, by power of good resolve, the strongest in right-doing.",
    "I do not doubt that you have a good heart; and I hope that better fortune will come to you.",
    "To-night I shall recite the sûtras for your sake, and pray that you may obtain the force to overcome the karma of any past errors.”",
    "With these assurances, Kwairyō bade the _aruji_ good-night; and his host showed him to a very small side-room, where a bed had been made ready.",
    "Then all went to sleep except the priest, who began to read the sûtras by the light of a paper lantern.",
    "Until a late hour he continued to read and pray: then he opened a little window in his little sleeping-room, to take a last look at the landscape before lying down.",
    "The night was beautiful: there was no cloud in the sky: there was no wind; and the strong moonlight threw down sharp black shadows of foliage, and glittered on the dews of the garden.",
    "Shrillings of crickets and bell-insects (3) made a musical tumult; and the sound of the neighboring cascade deepened with the night.",
    "Kwairyō felt thirsty as he listened to the noise of the water; and, remembering the bamboo aqueduct at the rear of the house, he thought that he could go there and get a drink without disturbing the sleeping household.",
    "Very gently he pushed apart the sliding-screens that separated his room from the main apartment; and he saw, by the light of the lantern, five recumbent bodies—without heads!",
    "For one instant he stood bewildered,—imagining a crime.",
    "But in another moment he perceived that there was no blood, and that the headless necks did not look as if they had been cut.",
    "Then he thought to himself:—“Either this is an illusion made by goblins, or I have been lured into the dwelling of a Rokuro-Kubi...",
    "(4) In the book _Sōshinki_ (5) it is written that if one find the body of a Rokuro-Kubi without its head, and remove the body to another place, the head will never be able to join itself again to the neck.",
    "And the book further says that when the head comes back and finds that its body has been moved, it will strike itself upon the floor three times,—bounding like a ball,—and will pant as in great fear, and presently die.",
    "Now, if these be Rokuro-Kubi, they mean me no good;—so I shall be justified in following the instructions of the book.”...",
    "He seized the body of the aruji by the feet, pulled it to the window, and pushed it out.",
    "Then he went to the back-door, which he found barred; and he surmised that the heads had made their exit through the smoke-hole in the roof, which had been left open.",
    "Gently unbarring the door, he made his way to the garden, and proceeded with all possible caution to the grove beyond it.",
    "He heard voices talking in the grove; and he went in the direction of the voices,—stealing from shadow to shadow, until he reached a good hiding-place.",
    "Then, from behind a trunk, he caught sight of the heads,—all five of them,—flitting about, and chatting as they flitted.",
    "They were eating worms and insects which they found on the ground or among the trees.",
    "Presently the head of the aruji stopped eating and said:— “Ah, that traveling priest who came to-night!—how fat all his body is!",
    "When we shall have eaten him, our bellies will be well filled...",
    "I was foolish to talk to him as I did;—it only set him to reciting the sûtras on behalf of my soul!",
    "To go near him while he is reciting would be difficult; and we cannot touch him so long as he is praying.",
    "But as it is now nearly morning, perhaps he has gone to sleep...",
    "Some one of you go to the house and see what the fellow is doing.”",
    "Another head—the head of a young woman—immediately rose up and flitted to the house, lightly as a bat.",
    "After a few minutes it came back, and cried out huskily, in a tone of great alarm:— “That traveling priest is not in the house;—he is gone!",
    "But that is not the worst of the matter.",
    "He has taken the body of our aruji; and I do not know where he has put it.”",
    "At this announcement the head of the aruji—distinctly visible in the moonlight—assumed a frightful aspect: its eyes opened monstrously; its hair stood up bristling; and its teeth gnashed.",
    "Then a cry burst from its lips; and—weeping tears of rage—it exclaimed:— “Since my body has been moved, to rejoin it is not possible!",
    "Then I must die!...",
    "And all through the work of that priest!",
    "Before I die I will get at that priest!—I will tear him!—I will devour him!...",
    "_",
    "And there he is_—behind that tree!—hiding behind that tree!",
    "See him!—the fat coward!”",
    "...",
    "In the same moment the head of the aruji, followed by the other four heads, sprang at Kwairyō.",
    "But the strong priest had already armed himself by plucking up a young tree; and with that tree he struck the heads as they came,—knocking them from him with tremendous blows.",
    "Four of them fled away.",
    "But the head of the aruji, though battered again and again, desperately continued to bound at the priest, and at last caught him by the left sleeve of his robe.",
    "Kwairyō, however, as quickly gripped the head by its topknot, and repeatedly struck it.",
    "It did not release its hold; but it uttered a long moan, and thereafter ceased to struggle.",
    "It was dead.",
    "But its teeth still held the sleeve; and, for all his great strength, Kwairyō could not force open the jaws.",
    "With the head still hanging to his sleeve he went back to the house, and there caught sight of the other four Rokuro-Kubi squatting together, with their bruised and bleeding heads reunited to their bodies.",
    "But when they perceived him at the back-door all screamed, “The priest!",
    "the priest!”—and fled, through the other doorway, out into the woods.",
    "Eastward the sky was brightening; day was about to dawn; and Kwairyō knew that the power of the goblins was limited to the hours of darkness.",
    "He looked at the head clinging to his sleeve,—its face all fouled with blood and foam and clay; and he laughed aloud as he thought to himself: “What a _miyagé!_[4]—the head of a goblin!”",
    "After which he gathered together his few belongings, and leisurely descended the mountain to continue his journey.",
    "Right on he journeyed, until he came to Suwa in Shinano; (6) and into the main street of Suwa he solemnly strode, with the head dangling at his elbow.",
    "Then woman fainted, and children screamed and ran away; and there was a great crowding and clamoring until the _torité_ (as the police in those days were called) seized the priest, and took him to jail.",
    "For they supposed the head to be the head of a murdered man who, in the moment of being killed, had caught the murderer’s sleeve in his teeth.",
    "As for Kwairyō, he only smiled and said nothing when they questioned him.",
    "So, after having passed a night in prison, he was brought before the magistrates of the district.",
    "Then he was ordered to explain how he, a priest, had been found with the head of a man fastened to his sleeve, and why he had dared thus shamelessly to parade his crime in the sight of people.",
    "Kwairyō laughed long and loudly at these questions; and then he said:— “Sirs, I did not fasten the head to my sleeve: it fastened itself there—much against my will.",
    "And I have not committed any crime.",
    "For this is not the head of a man; it is the head of a goblin;—and, if I caused the death of the goblin, I did not do so by any shedding of blood, but simply by taking the precautions necessary to assure my own safety.”...",
    "And he proceeded to relate the whole of the adventure,—bursting into another hearty laugh as he told of his encounter with the five heads.",
    "But the magistrates did not laugh.",
    "They judged him to be a hardened criminal, and his story an insult to their intelligence.",
    "Therefore, without further questioning, they decided to order his immediate execution,—all of them except one, a very old man.",
    "This aged officer had made no remark during the trial; but, after having heard the opinion of his colleagues, he rose up, and said:— “Let us first examine the head carefully; for this, I think, has not yet been done.",
    "If the priest has spoken truth, the head itself should bear witness for him...",
    "Bring the head here!”",
    "So the head, still holding in its teeth the _koromo_ that had been stripped from Kwairyō’s shoulders, was put before the judges.",
    "The old man turned it round and round, carefully examined it, and discovered, on the nape of its neck, several strange red characters.",
    "He called the attention of his colleagues to these, and also bade them observe that the edges of the neck nowhere presented the appearance of having been cut by any weapon.",
    "On the contrary, the line of leverance was smooth as the line at which a falling leaf detaches itself from the stem...",
    "Then said the elder:— “I am quite sure that the priest told us nothing but the truth.",
    "This is the head of a Rokuro-Kubi.",
    "In the book _Nan-hō-ï-butsu-shi_",
    "it is written that certain red characters can always be found upon the nape of the neck of a real Rokuro-Kubi.",
    "There are the characters: you can see for yourselves that they have not been painted.",
    "Moreover, it is well known that such goblins have been dwelling in the mountains of the province of Kai from very ancient time...",
    "But you, Sir,” he exclaimed, turning to Kwairyō,—“what sort of sturdy priest may you be?",
    "Certainly you have given proof of a courage that few priests possess; and you have the air of a soldier rather than a priest.",
    "Perhaps you once belonged to the samurai-class?”",
    "“You have guessed rightly, Sir,” Kwairyō responded.",
    "“Before becoming a priest, I long followed the profession of arms; and in those days I never feared man or devil.",
    "My name then was Isogai Héïdazaëmon Takétsura of Kyūshū: there may be some among you who remember it.”",
    "At the mention of that name, a murmur of admiration filled the court-room; for there were many present who remembered it.",
    "And Kwairyō immediately found himself among friends instead of judges,—friends anxious to prove their admiration by fraternal kindness.",
    "With honor they escorted him to the residence of the daimyō, who welcomed him, and feasted him, and made him a handsome present before allowing him to depart.",
    "When Kwairyō left Suwa, he was as happy as any priest is permitted to be in this transitory world.",
    "As for the head, he took it with him,—jocosely insisting that he intended it for a _miyagé_.",
    "And now it only remains to tell what became of the head.",
    "A day or two after leaving Suwa, Kwairyō met with a robber, who stopped him in a lonesome place, and bade him strip.",
    "Kwairyō at once removed his _koromo_, and offered it to the robber, who then first perceived what was hanging to the sleeve.",
    "Though brave, the highwayman was startled: he dropped the garment, and sprang back.",
    "Then he cried out:—“You!—what kind of a priest are you?",
    "Why, you are a worse man than I am!",
    "It is true that I have killed people; but I never walked about with anybody’s head fastened to my sleeve...",
    "Well, Sir priest, I suppose we are of the same calling; and I must say that I admire you!...",
    "Now that head would be of use to me: I could frighten people with it.",
    "Will you sell it?",
    "You can have my robe in exchange for your _koromo;_ and I will give you five _ryō_ for the head.”",
    "Kwairyō answered:— “I shall let you have the head and the robe if you insist; but I must tell you that this is not the head of a man.",
    "It is a goblin’s head.",
    "So, if you buy it, and have any trouble in consequence, please to remember that you were not deceived by me.”",
    "“What a nice priest you are!” exclaimed the robber.",
    "“You kill men, and jest about it!...",
    "But I am really in earnest.",
    "Here is my robe; and here is the money;—and let me have the head...",
    "What is the use of joking?”",
    "“Take the thing,” said Kwairyō.",
    "“I was not joking.",
    "The only joke—if there be any joke at all—is that you are fool enough to pay good money for a goblin’s head.”",
    "And Kwairyō, loudly laughing, went upon his way.",
    "Thus the robber got the head and the _koromo;_ and for some time he played goblin-priest upon the highways.",
    "But, reaching the neighborhood of Suwa, he there leaned the true story of the head; and he then became afraid that the spirit of the Rokuro-Kubi might give him trouble.",
    "So he made up his mind to take back the head to the place from which it had come, and to bury it with its body.",
    "He found his way to the lonely cottage in the mountains of Kai; but nobody was there, and he could not discover the body.",
    "Therefore he buried the head by itself, in the grove behind the cottage; and he had a tombstone set up over the grave; and he caused a Ségaki-service to be performed on behalf of the spirit of the Rokuro-Kubi.",
    "And that tombstone—known as the Tombstone of the Rokuro-Kubi—may be seen (at least so the Japanese story-teller declares) even unto this day.",
    "A DEAD SECRET A long time ago, in the province of Tamba (1), there lived a rich merchant named Inamuraya Gensuké.",
    "He had a daughter called O-Sono.",
    "As she was very clever and pretty, he thought it would be a pity to let her grow up with only such teaching as the country-teachers could give her: so he sent her, in care of some trusty attendants, to Kyōto, that she might be trained in the polite accomplishments taught to the ladies of the capital.",
    "After she had thus been educated, she was married to a friend of her father’s family—a merchant named Nagaraya;—and she lived happily with him for nearly four years.",
    "They had one child,—a boy.",
    "But O-Sono fell ill and died, in the fourth year after her marriage.",
    "On the night after the funeral of O-Sono, her little son said that his mamma had come back, and was in the room upstairs.",
    "She had smiled at him, but would not talk to him: so he became afraid, and ran away.",
    "Then some of the family went upstairs to the room which had been O-Sono’s; and they were startled to see, by the light of a small lamp which had been kindled before a shrine in that room, the figure of the dead mother.",
    "She appeared as if standing in front of a _tansu_, or chest of drawers, that still contained her ornaments and her wearing-apparel.",
    "Her head and shoulders could be very distinctly seen; but from the waist downwards the figure thinned into invisibility;—it was like an imperfect reflection of her, and transparent as a shadow on water.",
    "Then the folk were afraid, and left the room.",
    "Below they consulted together; and the mother of O-Sono’s husband said: “A woman is fond of her small things; and O-Sono was much attached to her belongings.",
    "Perhaps she has come back to look at them.",
    "Many dead persons will do that,—unless the things be given to the parish-temple.",
    "If we present O-Sono’s robes and girdles to the temple, her spirit will probably find rest.”",
    "It was agreed that this should be done as soon as possible.",
    "So on the following morning the drawers were emptied; and all of O-Sono’s ornaments and dresses were taken to the temple.",
    "But she came back the next night, and looked at the _tansu_ as before.",
    "And she came back also on the night following, and the night after that, and every night;—and the house became a house of fear.",
    "The mother of O-Sono’s husband then went to the parish-temple, and told the chief priest all that had happened, and asked for ghostly counsel.",
    "The temple was a Zen temple; and the head-priest was a learned old man, known as Daigen Oshō.",
    "He said: “There must be something about which she is anxious, in or near that _tansu_.”—“But we emptied all the drawers,” replied the woman;—“there is nothing in the _tansu_.”—“Well,” said Daigen Oshō, “to-night I shall go to your house, and keep watch in that room, and see what can be done.",
    "You must give orders that no person shall enter the room while I am watching, unless I call.”",
    "After sundown, Daigen Oshō went to the house, and found the room made ready for him.",
    "He remained there alone, reading the sûtras; and nothing appeared until after the Hour of the Rat.[1]",
    "Then the figure of O-Sono suddenly outlined itself in front of the _tansu_.",
    "Her face had a wistful look; and she kept her eyes fixed upon the _tansu_.",
    "The priest uttered the holy formula prescribed in such cases, and then, addressing the figure by the _kaimyō_[2] of O-Sono, said:—“I have come here in order to help you.",
    "Perhaps in that _tansu_ there is something about which you have reason to feel anxious.",
    "Shall I try to find it for you?”",
    "The shadow appeared to give assent by a slight motion of the head; and the priest, rising, opened the top drawer.",
    "It was empty.",
    "Successively he opened the second, the third, and the fourth drawer;—he searched carefully behind them and beneath them;—he carefully examined the interior of the chest.",
    "He found nothing.",
    "But the figure remained gazing as wistfully as before.",
    "“What can she want?” thought the priest.",
    "Suddenly it occurred to him that there might be something hidden under the paper with which the drawers were lined.",
    "He removed the lining of the first drawer:—nothing!",
    "He removed the lining of the second and third drawers:—still nothing.",
    "But under the lining of the lowermost drawer he found—a letter.",
    "“Is this the thing about which you have been troubled?”",
    "he asked.",
    "The shadow of the woman turned toward him,—her faint gaze fixed upon the letter.",
    "“Shall I burn it for you?” he asked.",
    "She bowed before him.",
    "“It shall be burned in the temple this very morning,” he promised;—“and no one shall read it, except myself.”",
    "The figure smiled and vanished.",
    "Dawn was breaking as the priest descended the stairs, to find the family waiting anxiously below.",
    "“Do not be anxious,” he said to them: “She will not appear again.”",
    "And she never did.",
    "The letter was burned.",
    "It was a love-letter written to O-Sono in the time of her studies at Kyōto.",
    "But the priest alone knew what was in it; and the secret died with him.",
    "YUKI-ONNA In a village of Musashi Province (1), there lived two woodcutters: Mosaku and Minokichi.",
    "At the time of which I am speaking, Mosaku was an old man; and Minokichi, his apprentice, was a lad of eighteen years.",
    "Every day they went together to a forest situated about five miles from their village.",
    "On the way to that forest there is a wide river to cross; and there is a ferry-boat.",
    "Several times a bridge was built where the ferry is; but the bridge was each time carried away by a flood.",
    "No common bridge can resist the current there when the river rises.",
    "Mosaku and Minokichi were on their way home, one very cold evening, when a great snowstorm overtook them.",
    "They reached the ferry; and they found that the boatman had gone away, leaving his boat on the other side of the river.",
    "It was no day for swimming; and the woodcutters took shelter in the ferryman’s hut,—thinking themselves lucky to find any shelter at all.",
    "There was no brazier in the hut, nor any place in which to make a fire: it was only a two-mat[1] hut, with a single door, but no window.",
    "Mosaku and Minokichi fastened the door, and lay down to rest, with their straw rain-coats over them.",
    "At first they did not feel very cold; and they thought that the storm would soon be over.",
    "The old man almost immediately fell asleep; but the boy, Minokichi, lay awake a long time, listening to the awful wind, and the continual slashing of the snow against the door.",
    "The river was roaring; and the hut swayed and creaked like a junk at sea.",
    "It was a terrible storm; and the air was every moment becoming colder; and Minokichi shivered under his rain-coat.",
    "But at last, in spite of the cold, he too fell asleep.",
    "He was awakened by a showering of snow in his face.",
    "The door of the hut had been forced open; and, by the snow-light (_yuki-akari_), he saw a woman in the room,—a woman all in white.",
    "She was bending above Mosaku, and blowing her breath upon him;—and her breath was like a bright white smoke.",
    "Almost in the same moment she turned to Minokichi, and stooped over him.",
    "He tried to cry out, but found that he could not utter any sound.",
    "The white woman bent down over him, lower and lower, until her face almost touched him; and he saw that she was very beautiful,—though her eyes made him afraid.",
    "For a little time she continued to look at him;—then she smiled, and she whispered:—“I intended to treat you like the other man.",
    "But I cannot help feeling some pity for you,—because you are so young...",
    "You are a pretty boy, Minokichi; and I will not hurt you now.",
    "But, if you ever tell anybody—even your own mother—about what you have seen this night, I shall know it; and then I will kill you...",
    "Remember what I say!”",
    "[Illustration] BLOWING HER BREATH UPON HIM With these words, she turned from him, and passed through the doorway.",
    "Then he found himself able to move; and he sprang up, and looked out.",
    "But the woman was nowhere to be seen; and the snow was driving furiously into the hut.",
    "Minokichi closed the door, and secured it by fixing several billets of wood against it.",
    "He wondered if the wind had blown it open;—he thought that he might have been only dreaming, and might have mistaken the gleam of the snow-light in the doorway for the figure of a white woman: but he could not be sure.",
    "He called to Mosaku, and was frightened because the old man did not answer.",
    "He put out his hand in the dark, and touched Mosaku’s face, and found that it was ice!",
    "Mosaku was stark and dead...",
    "By dawn the storm was over; and when the ferryman returned to his station, a little after sunrise, he found Minokichi lying senseless beside the frozen body of Mosaku.",
    "Minokichi was promptly cared for, and soon came to himself; but he remained a long time ill from the effects of the cold of that terrible night.",
    "He had been greatly frightened also by the old man’s death; but he said nothing about the vision of the woman in white.",
    "As soon as he got well again, he returned to his calling,—going alone every morning to the forest, and coming back at nightfall with his bundles of wood, which his mother helped him to sell.",
    "One evening, in the winter of the following year, as he was on his way home, he overtook a girl who happened to be traveling by the same road.",
    "She was a tall, slim girl, very good-looking; and she answered Minokichi’s greeting in a voice as pleasant to the ear as the voice of a song-bird.",
    "Then he walked beside her; and they began to talk.",
    "The girl said that her name was O-Yuki;[2] that she had lately lost both of her parents; and that she was going to Yedo (2), where she happened to have some poor relations, who might help her to find a situation as a servant.",
    "Minokichi soon felt charmed by this strange girl; and the more that he looked at her, the handsomer she appeared to be.",
    "He asked her whether she was yet betrothed; and she answered, laughingly, that she was free.",
    "Then, in her turn, she asked Minokichi whether he was married, or pledged to marry; and he told her that, although he had only a widowed mother to support, the question of an “honorable daughter-in-law” had not yet been considered, as he was very young...",
    "After these confidences, they walked on for a long while without speaking; but, as the proverb declares, _Ki ga aréba, mé mo kuchi hodo ni mono wo iu:_",
    "“When the wish is there, the eyes can say as much as the mouth.”",
    "By the time they reached the village, they had become very much pleased with each other; and then Minokichi asked O-Yuki to rest awhile at his house.",
    "After some shy hesitation, she went there with him; and his mother made her welcome, and prepared a warm meal for her.",
    "O-Yuki behaved so nicely that Minokichi’s mother took a sudden fancy to her, and persuaded her to delay her journey to Yedo.",
    "And the natural end of the matter was that Yuki never went to Yedo at all.",
    "She remained in the house, as an “honorable daughter-in-law.”",
    "O-Yuki proved a very good daughter-in-law.",
    "When Minokichi’s mother came to die,—some five years later,—her last words were words of affection and praise for the wife of her son.",
    "And O-Yuki bore Minokichi ten children, boys and girls,—handsome children all of them, and very fair of skin.",
    "The country-folk thought O-Yuki a wonderful person, by nature different from themselves.",
    "Most of the peasant-women age early; but O-Yuki, even after having become the mother of ten children, looked as young and fresh as on the day when she had first come to the village.",
    "One night, after the children had gone to sleep, O-Yuki was sewing by the light of a paper lamp; and Minokichi, watching her, said:— “To see you sewing there, with the light on your face, makes me think of a strange thing that happened when I was a lad of eighteen.",
    "I then saw somebody as beautiful and white as you are now—indeed, she was very like you.”...",
    "Without lifting her eyes from her work, O-Yuki responded:— “Tell me about her...",
    "Where did you see her?”",
    "Then Minokichi told her about the terrible night in the ferryman’s hut,—and about the White Woman that had stooped above him, smiling and whispering,—and about the silent death of old Mosaku.",
    "And he said:— “Asleep or awake, that was the only time that I saw a being as beautiful as you.",
    "Of course, she was not a human being; and I was afraid of her,—very much",
    "afraid,—but she was so white!...",
    "Indeed, I have never been sure whether it was a dream that I saw, or the Woman of the Snow.”...",
    "O-Yuki flung down her sewing, and arose, and bowed above Minokichi where he sat, and shrieked into his face:— “It was I—I—I!",
    "Yuki it was!",
    "And I told you then that I would kill you if you ever said one word about it!...",
    "But for those children asleep there, I would kill you this moment!",
    "And now you had better take very, very good care of them; for if ever they have reason to complain of you, I will treat you as you deserve!”...",
    "Even as she screamed, her voice became thin, like a crying of wind;—then she melted into a bright white mist that spired to the roof-beams, and shuddered away through the smoke-hole....",
    "Never again was she seen.",
    "THE STORY OF AOYAGI In the era of Bummei [1469-1486] there was a young samurai called Tomotada in the service of Hatakéyama Yoshimuné, the Lord of Noto (1).",
    "Tomotada was a native of Echizen (2); but at an early age he had been taken, as page, into the palace of the daimyō of Noto, and had been educated, under the supervision of that prince, for the profession of arms.",
    "As he grew up, he proved himself both a good scholar and a good soldier, and continued to enjoy the favor of his prince.",
    "Being gifted with an amiable character, a winning address, and a very handsome person, he was admired and much liked by his samurai-comrades.",
    "When Tomotada was about twenty years old, he was sent upon a private mission to Hosokawa Masamoto, the great daimyō of Kyōto, a kinsman of Hatakéyama Yoshimuné.",
    "Having been ordered to journey through Echizen, the youth requested and obtained permission to pay a visit, on the way, to his widowed mother.",
    "It was the coldest period of the year when he started; and, though mounted upon a powerful horse, he found himself obliged to proceed slowly.",
    "The road which he followed passed through a mountain-district where the settlements were few and far between; and on the second day of his journey, after a weary ride of hours, he was dismayed to find that he could not reach his intended halting-place until late in the night.",
    "He had reason to be anxious;—for a heavy snowstorm came on, with an intensely cold wind; and the horse showed signs of exhaustion.",
    "But in that trying moment, Tomotada unexpectedly perceived the thatched room of a cottage on the summit of a near hill, where willow-trees were growing.",
    "With difficulty he urged his tired animal to the dwelling; and he loudly knocked upon the storm-doors, which had been closed against the wind.",
    "An old woman opened them, and cried out compassionately at the sight of the handsome stranger: “Ah, how pitiful!—a young gentleman traveling alone in such weather!...",
    "Deign, young master, to enter.”",
    "Tomotada dismounted, and after leading his horse to a shed in the rear, entered the cottage, where he saw an old man and a girl warming themselves by a fire of bamboo splints.",
    "They respectfully invited him to approach the fire; and the old folks then proceeded to warm some rice-wine, and to prepare food for the traveler, whom they ventured to question in regard to his journey.",
    "Meanwhile the young girl disappeared behind a screen.",
    "Tomotada had observed, with astonishment, that she was extremely beautiful,—though her attire was of the most wretched kind, and her long, loose hair in disorder.",
    "He wondered that so handsome a girl should be living in such a miserable and lonesome place.",
    "The old man said to him:— “Honored Sir, the next village is far; and the snow is falling thickly.",
    "The wind is piercing; and the road is very bad.",
    "Therefore, to proceed further this night would probably be dangerous.",
    "Although this hovel is unworthy of your presence, and although we have not any comfort to offer, perhaps it were safer to remain to-night under this miserable roof...",
    "We would take good care of your horse.”",
    "Tomotada accepted this humble proposal,—secretly glad of the chance thus afforded him to see more of the young girl.",
    "Presently a coarse but ample meal was set before him; and the girl came from behind the screen, to serve the wine.",
    "She was now reclad, in a rough but cleanly robe of homespun; and her long, loose hair had been neatly combed and smoothed.",
    "As she bent forward to fill his cup, Tomotada was amazed to perceive that she was incomparably more beautiful than any woman whom he had ever before seen; and there was a grace about her every motion that astonished him.",
    "But the elders began to apologize for her, saying: “Sir, our daughter, Aoyagi,[1] has been brought up here in the mountains, almost alone; and she knows nothing of gentle service.",
    "We pray that you will pardon her stupidity and her ignorance.”",
    "Tomotada protested that he deemed himself lucky to be waited upon by so comely a maiden.",
    "He could not turn his eyes away from her—though he saw that his admiring gaze made her blush;—and he left the wine and food untasted before him.",
    "The mother said: “Kind Sir, we very much hope that you will try to eat and to drink a little,—though our peasant-fare is of the worst,—as you must have been chilled by that piercing wind.”",
    "Then, to please the old folks, Tomotada ate and drank as he could; but the charm of the blushing girl still grew upon him.",
    "He talked with her, and found that her speech was sweet as her face.",
    "Brought up in the mountains as she might have been;—but, in that case, her parents must at some time been persons of high degree; for she spoke and moved like a damsel of rank.",
    "Suddenly he addressed her with a poem—which was also a question—inspired by the delight in his heart:— “Tadzunétsuru, Hana ka toté koso, Hi wo kurasé, Akénu ni otoru Akané sasuran?”",
    "[“_Being on my way to pay a visit, I found that which I took to be a flower: therefore here I spend the day...",
    "Why, in the time before dawn, the dawn-blush tint should glow—that, indeed, I know not._”][2] Without a moment’s hesitation, she answered him in these verses:— “Izuru hi no Honoméku iro wo Waga sodé ni Tsutsumaba asu mo Kimiya tomaran.”",
    "[“_If with my sleeve I hid the faint fair color of the dawning sun,—then, perhaps, in the morning my lord will remain._”][3] Then Tomotada knew that she accepted his admiration; and he was scarcely less surprised by the art with which she had uttered her feelings in verse, than delighted by the assurance which the verses conveyed.",
    "He was now certain that in all this world he could not hope to meet, much less to win, a girl more beautiful and witty than this rustic maid before him; and a voice in his heart seemed to cry out urgently, “Take the luck that the gods have put in your way!”",
    "In short he was bewitched—bewitched to such a degree that, without further preliminary, he asked the old people to give him their daughter in marriage,—telling them, at the same time, his name and lineage, and his rank in the train of the Lord of Noto.",
    "They bowed down before him, with many exclamations of grateful astonishment.",
    "But, after some moments of apparent hesitation, the father replied:— “Honored master, you are a person of high position, and likely to rise to still higher things.",
    "Too great is the favor that you deign to offer us;—indeed, the depth of our gratitude therefor is not to be spoken or measured.",
    "But this girl of ours, being a stupid country-girl of vulgar birth, with no training or teaching of any sort, it would be improper to let her become the wife of a noble samurai.",
    "Even to speak of such a matter is not right...",
    "But, since you find the girl to your liking, and have condescended to pardon her peasant-manners and to overlook her great rudeness, we do gladly present her to you, for an humble handmaid.",
    "Deign, therefore, to act hereafter in her regard according to your august pleasure.”",
    "Ere morning the storm had passed; and day broke through a cloudless east.",
    "Even if the sleeve of Aoyagi hid from her lover’s eyes the rose-blush of that dawn, he could no longer tarry.",
    "But neither could he resign himself to part with the girl; and, when everything had been prepared for his journey, he thus addressed her parents:— “Though it may seem thankless to ask for more than I have already received, I must again beg you to give me your daughter for wife.",
    "It would be difficult for me to separate from her now; and as she is willing to accompany me, if you permit, I can take her with me as she is.",
    "If you will give her to me, I shall ever cherish you as parents...",
    "And, in the meantime, please to accept this poor acknowledgment of your kindest hospitality.”",
    "So saying, he placed before his humble host a purse of gold _ryō_.",
    "But the old man, after many prostrations, gently pushed back the gift, and said:— “Kind master, the gold would be of no use to us; and you will probably have need of it during your long, cold journey.",
    "Here we buy nothing; and we could not spend so much money upon ourselves, even if we wished...",
    "As for the girl, we have already bestowed her as a free gift;—she belongs to you: therefore it is not necessary to ask our leave to take her away.",
    "Already she has told us that she hopes to accompany you, and to remain your servant for as long as you may be willing to endure her presence.",
    "We are only too happy to know that you deign to accept her; and we pray that you will not trouble yourself on our account.",
    "In this place we could not provide her with proper clothing,—much less with a dowry.",
    "Moreover, being old, we should in any event have to separate from her before long.",
    "Therefore it is very fortunate that you should be willing to take her with you now.”",
    "It was in vain that Tomotada tried to persuade the old people to accept a present: he found that they cared nothing for money.",
    "But he saw that they were really anxious to trust their daughter’s fate to his hands; and he therefore decided to take her with him.",
    "So he placed her upon his horse, and bade the old folks farewell for the time being, with many sincere expressions of gratitude.",
    "“Honored Sir,” the father made answer, “it is we, and not you, who have reason for gratitude.",
    "We are sure that you will be kind to our girl; and we have no fears for her sake.”...",
    "[_Here, in the Japanese original, there is a queer break in the natural course of the narration, which therefrom remains curiously inconsistent.",
    "Nothing further is said about the mother of Tomotada, or about the parents of Aoyagi, or about the daimyō of Noto.",
    "Evidently the writer wearied of his work at this point, and hurried the story, very carelessly, to its startling end.",
    "I am not able to supply his omissions, or to repair his faults of construction; but I must venture to put in a few explanatory details, without which the rest of the tale would not hold together...",
    "It appears that Tomotada rashly took Aoyagi with him to Kyōto, and so got into trouble; but we are not informed as to where the couple lived afterwards._] ...",
    "Now a samurai was not allowed to marry without the consent of his lord; and Tomotada could not expect to obtain this sanction before his mission had been accomplished.",
    "He had reason, under such circumstances, to fear that the beauty of Aoyagi might attract dangerous attention, and that means might be devised of taking her away from him.",
    "In Kyōto he therefore tried to keep her hidden from curious eyes.",
    "But a retainer of Lord Hosokawa one day caught sight of Aoyagi, discovered her relation to Tomotada, and reported the matter to the daimyō.",
    "Thereupon the daimyō—a young prince, and fond of pretty faces—gave orders that the girl should be brought to the place; and she was taken thither at once, without ceremony.",
    "Tomotada sorrowed unspeakably; but he knew himself powerless.",
    "He was only an humble messenger in the service of a far-off daimyō; and for the time being he was at the mercy of a much more powerful daimyō, whose wishes were not to be questioned.",
    "Moreover Tomotada knew that he had acted foolishly,—that he had brought about his own misfortune, by entering into a clandestine relation which the code of the military class condemned.",
    "There was now but one hope for him,—a desperate hope: that Aoyagi might be able and willing to escape and to flee with him.",
    "After long reflection, he resolved to try to send her a letter.",
    "The attempt would be dangerous, of course: any writing sent to her might find its way to the hands of the daimyō; and to send a love-letter to any inmate of the place was an unpardonable offense.",
    "But he resolved to dare the risk; and, in the form of a Chinese poem, he composed a letter which he endeavored to have conveyed to her.",
    "The poem was written with only twenty-eight characters.",
    "But with those twenty-eight characters he was about to express all the depth of his passion, and to suggest all the pain of his loss:—[4] Kōshi ō-son gojin wo ou; Ryokuju namida wo tarété rakin wo hitataru; Komon hitotabi irité fukaki koto umi no gotoshi; Koré yori shorō koré rojin",
    "[_Closely, closely the youthful prince now follows after the gem-bright maid;— The tears of the fair one, falling, have moistened all her robes.",
    "But the august lord, having once become enamored of her—the depth of his longing is like the depth of the sea.",
    "Therefore it is only I that am left forlorn,—only I that am left to wander along.",
    "_]",
    "On the evening of the day after this poem had been sent, Tomotada was summoned to appear before the Lord Hosokawa.",
    "The youth at once suspected that his confidence had been betrayed; and he could not hope, if his letter had been seen by the daimyō, to escape the severest penalty.",
    "“Now he will order my death,” thought",
    "Tomotada;—“but I do not care to live unless Aoyagi be restored to me.",
    "Besides, if the death-sentence be passed, I can at least try to kill Hosokawa.”",
    "He slipped his swords into his girdle, and hastened to the palace.",
    "On entering the presence-room he saw the Lord Hosokawa seated upon the dais, surrounded by samurai of high rank, in caps and robes of ceremony.",
    "All were silent as statues; and while Tomotada advanced to make obeisance, the hush seemed to him sinister and heavy, like the stillness before a storm.",
    "But Hosokawa suddenly descended from the dais, and, while taking the youth by the arm, began to repeat the words of the poem:—“_Kōshi ō-son gojin wo ou_.”...",
    "And Tomotada, looking up, saw kindly tears in the prince’s eyes.",
    "Then said Hosokawa:— “Because you love each other so much, I have taken it upon myself to authorize your marriage, in lieu of my kinsman, the Lord of Noto; and your wedding shall now be celebrated before me.",
    "The guests are assembled;—the gifts are ready.”",
    "At a signal from the lord, the sliding-screens concealing a further apartment were pushed open; and Tomotada saw there many dignitaries of the court, assembled for the ceremony, and Aoyagi awaiting him in brides’ apparel...",
    "Thus was she given back to him;—and the wedding was joyous and splendid;—and precious gifts were made to the young couple by the prince, and by the members of his household.",
    "For five happy years, after that wedding, Tomotada and Aoyagi dwelt together.",
    "But one morning Aoyagi, while talking with her husband about some household matter, suddenly uttered a great cry of pain, and then became very white and still.",
    "After a few moments she said, in a feeble voice: “Pardon me for thus rudely crying out—but the pain was so sudden!...",
    "My dear husband, our union must have been brought about through some Karma-relation in a former state of existence; and that happy relation, I think, will bring us again together in more than one life to come.",
    "But for this present existence of ours, the relation is now ended;—we are about to be separated.",
    "Repeat for me, I beseech you, the _",
    "Nembutsu_-prayer,—because I am dying.”",
    "“Oh!",
    "what strange wild fancies!” cried the startled husband,—“you are only a little unwell, my dear one!...",
    "lie down for a while, and rest; and the sickness will pass.”...",
    "“No, no!”",
    "she responded—“I am dying!—I do not imagine it;—I know!...",
    "And it were needless now, my dear husband, to hide the truth from you any longer:—I am not a human being.",
    "The soul of a tree is my soul;—the heart of a tree is my heart;—the sap of the willow is my life.",
    "And some one, at this cruel moment, is cutting down my tree;—that is why I must die!...",
    "Even to weep were now beyond my strength!—quickly, quickly repeat the _Nembutsu_ for me... quickly!...",
    "Ah!...”",
    "With another cry of pain she turned aside her beautiful head, and tried to hide her face behind her sleeve.",
    "But almost in the same moment her whole form appeared to collapse in the strangest way, and to sink down, down, down—level with the floor.",
    "Tomotada had sprung to support her;—but there was nothing to support!",
    "There lay on the matting only the empty robes of the fair creature and the ornaments that she had worn in her hair: the body had ceased to exist...",
    "Tomotada shaved his head, took the Buddhist vows, and became an itinerant priest.",
    "He traveled through all the provinces of the empire; and, at holy places which he visited, he offered up prayers for the soul of Aoyagi.",
    "Reaching Echizen, in the course of his pilgrimage, he sought the home of the parents of his beloved.",
    "But when he arrived at the lonely place among the hills, where their dwelling had been, he found that the cottage had disappeared.",
    "There was nothing to mark even the spot where it had stood, except the stumps of three willows—two old trees and one young tree—that had been cut down long before his arrival.",
    "Beside the stumps of those willow-trees he erected a memorial tomb, inscribed with divers holy texts; and he there performed many Buddhist services on behalf of the spirits of Aoyagi and of her parents.",
    "JIU-ROKU-ZAKURA Uso no yona,— Jiu-roku-zakura Saki ni keri!",
    "In Wakégōri, a district of the province of Iyo (1), there is a very ancient and famous cherry-tree, called _Jiu-roku-zakura_, or “the Cherry-tree of the Sixteenth Day,” because it blooms every year upon the sixteenth day of the first month (by the old lunar calendar),—and only upon that day.",
    "Thus the time of its flowering is the Period of Great Cold,—though the natural habit of a cherry-tree is to wait for the spring season before venturing to blossom.",
    "But the _Jiu-roku-zakura_ blossoms with a life that is not—or, at least, that was not originally—its own.",
    "There is the ghost of a man in that tree.",
    "He was a samurai of Iyo; and the tree grew in his garden; and it used to flower at the usual time,—that is to say, about the end of March or the beginning of April.",
    "He had played under that tree when he was a child; and his parents and grandparents and ancestors had hung to its blossoming branches, season after season for more than a hundred years, bright strips of colored paper inscribed with poems of praise.",
    "He himself became very old,—outliving all his children; and there was nothing in the world left for him to love except that tree.",
    "And lo! in the summer of a certain year, the tree withered and died!",
    "Exceedingly the old man sorrowed for his tree.",
    "Then kind neighbors found for him a young and beautiful cherry-tree, and planted it in his garden,—hoping thus to comfort him.",
    "And he thanked them, and pretended to be glad.",
    "But really his heart was full of pain; for he had loved the old tree so well that nothing could have consoled him for the loss of it.",
    "At last there came to him a happy thought: he remembered a way by which the perishing tree might be saved.",
    "(It was the sixteenth day of the first month.)",
    "Along he went into his garden, and bowed down before the withered tree, and spoke to it, saying: “Now deign, I beseech you, once more to bloom,—because I am going to die in your stead.”",
    "(For it is believed that one can really give away one’s life to another person, or to a creature or even to a tree, by the favor of the gods;—and thus to transfer one’s life is expressed by the term _migawari ni tatsu_, “to act as a substitute.”)",
    "Then under that tree he spread a white cloth, and divers coverings, and sat down upon the coverings, and performed _hara-kiri_ after the fashion of a samurai.",
    "And the ghost of him went into the tree, and made it blossom in that same hour.",
    "And every year it still blooms on the sixteenth day of the first month, in the season of snow.",
    "THE DREAM OF AKINOSUKÉ In the district called Toïchi of Yamato Province, (1) there used to live a gōshi named Miyata Akinosuké...",
    "[Here I must tell you that in Japanese feudal times there was a privileged class of soldier-farmers,—free-holders,—corresponding to the class of yeomen in England; and these were called gōshi.]",
    "In Akinosuké’s garden there was a great and ancient cedar-tree, under which he was wont to rest on sultry days.",
    "One very warm afternoon he was sitting under this tree with two of his friends, fellow-gōshi, chatting and drinking wine, when he felt all of a sudden very drowsy,—so drowsy that he begged his friends to excuse him for taking a nap in their presence.",
    "Then he lay down at the foot of the tree, and dreamed this dream:— He thought that as he was lying there in his garden, he saw a procession, like the train of some great daimyō descending a hill near by, and that he got up to look at it.",
    "A very grand procession it proved to be,—more imposing than anything of the kind which he had ever seen before; and it was advancing toward his dwelling.",
    "He observed in the van of it a number of young men richly appareled, who were drawing a great lacquered palace-carriage, or _gosho-guruma_, hung with bright blue silk.",
    "When the procession arrived within a short distance of the house it halted; and a richly dressed man—evidently a person of rank—advanced from it, approached Akinosuké, bowed to him profoundly, and then said:— “Honored Sir, you see before you a _kérai_",
    "[vassal] of the Kokuō of Tokoyo.[1]",
    "My master, the King, commands me to greet you in his august name, and to place myself wholly at your disposal.",
    "He also bids me inform you that he augustly desires your presence at the palace.",
    "Be therefore pleased immediately to enter this honorable carriage, which he has sent for your conveyance.”",
    "Upon hearing these words Akinosuké wanted to make some fitting reply; but he was too much astonished and embarrassed for speech;—and in the same moment his will seemed to melt away from him, so that he could only do as the _kérai_ bade him.",
    "He entered the carriage; the _kérai_ took a place beside him, and made a signal; the drawers, seizing the silken ropes, turned the great vehicle southward;—and the journey began.",
    "In a very short time, to Akinosuké’s amazement, the carriage stopped in front of a huge two-storied gateway (_rōmon_), of a Chinese style, which he had never before seen.",
    "Here the _kérai_ dismounted, saying, “I go to announce the honorable arrival,”—and he disappeared.",
    "After some little waiting, Akinosuké saw two noble-looking men, wearing robes of purple silk and high caps of the form indicating lofty rank, come from the gateway.",
    "These, after having respectfully saluted him, helped him to descend from the carriage, and led him through the great gate and across a vast garden, to the entrance of a palace whose front appeared to extend, west and east, to a distance of miles.",
    "Akinosuké was then shown into a reception-room of wonderful size and splendor.",
    "His guides conducted him to the place of honor, and respectfully seated themselves apart; while serving-maids, in costume of ceremony, brought refreshments.",
    "When Akinosuké had partaken of the refreshments, the two purple-robed attendants bowed low before him, and addressed him in the following words,—each speaking alternately, according to the etiquette of courts:— “It is now our honorable duty to inform you... as to the reason of your having been summoned hither...",
    "Our master, the King, augustly desires that you become his son-in-law;... and it is his wish and command that you shall wed this very day... the August Princess, his maiden-daughter...",
    "We shall soon conduct you to the presence-chamber... where His Augustness even now is waiting to receive you...",
    "But it will be necessary that we first invest you... with the appropriate garments of ceremony.",
    "”[2]",
    "Having thus spoken, the attendants rose together, and proceeded to an alcove containing a great chest of gold lacquer.",
    "They opened the chest, and took from it various robes and girdles of rich material, and a _kamuri_, or regal headdress.",
    "With these they attired Akinosuké as befitted a princely bridegroom; and he was then conducted to the presence-room, where he saw the Kokuō of Tokoyo seated upon the _daiza_,[3] wearing a high black cap of state, and robed in robes of yellow silk.",
    "Before the _daiza_, to left and right, a multitude of dignitaries sat in rank, motionless and splendid as images in a temple; and Akinosuké, advancing into their midst, saluted the king with the triple prostration of usage.",
    "The king greeted him with gracious words, and then said:— “You have already been informed as to the reason of your having been summoned to Our presence.",
    "We have decided that you shall become the adopted husband of Our only daughter;—and the wedding ceremony shall now be performed.”",
    "As the king finished speaking, a sound of joyful music was heard; and a long train of beautiful court ladies advanced from behind a curtain to conduct Akinosuké to the room in which his bride awaited him.",
    "The room was immense; but it could scarcely contain the multitude of guests assembled to witness the wedding ceremony.",
    "All bowed down before Akinosuké as he took his place, facing the King’s daughter, on the kneeling-cushion prepared for him.",
    "As a maiden of heaven the bride appeared to be; and her robes were beautiful as a summer sky.",
    "And the marriage was performed amid great rejoicing.",
    "Afterwards the pair were conducted to a suite of apartments that had been prepared for them in another portion of the palace; and there they received the congratulations of many noble persons, and wedding gifts beyond counting.",
    "Some days later Akinosuké was again summoned to the throne-room.",
    "On this occasion he was received even more graciously than before; and the King said to him:— “In the southwestern part of Our dominion there is an island called Raishū.",
    "We have now appointed you Governor of that island.",
    "You will find the people loyal and docile; but their laws have not yet been brought into proper accord with the laws of Tokoyo; and their customs have not been properly regulated.",
    "We entrust you with the duty of improving their social condition as far as may be possible; and We desire that you shall rule them with kindness and wisdom.",
    "All preparations necessary for your journey to Raishū have already been made.”",
    "So Akinosuké and his bride departed from the palace of Tokoyo, accompanied to the shore by a great escort of nobles and officials; and they embarked upon a ship of state provided by the king.",
    "And with favoring winds they safety sailed to Raishū, and found the good people of that island assembled upon the beach to welcome them.",
    "Akinosuké entered at once upon his new duties; and they did not prove to be hard.",
    "During the first three years of his governorship he was occupied chiefly with the framing and the enactment of laws; but he had wise counselors to help him, and he never found the work unpleasant.",
    "When it was all finished, he had no active duties to perform, beyond attending the rites and ceremonies ordained by ancient custom.",
    "The country was so healthy and so fertile that sickness and want were unknown; and the people were so good that no laws were ever broken.",
    "And Akinosuké dwelt and ruled in Raishū for twenty years more,—making in all twenty-three years of sojourn, during which no shadow of sorrow traversed his life.",
    "But in the twenty-fourth year of his governorship, a great misfortune came upon him; for his wife, who had borne him seven children,—five boys and two girls,—fell sick and died.",
    "She was buried, with high pomp, on the summit of a beautiful hill in the district of Hanryōkō; and a monument, exceedingly splendid, was placed upon her grave.",
    "But Akinosuké felt such grief at her death that he no longer cared to live.",
    "Now when the legal period of mourning was over, there came to Raishū, from the Tokoyo palace, a _shisha_, or royal messenger.",
    "The _shisha_ delivered to Akinosuké a message of condolence, and then said to him:— “These are the words which our august master, the King of Tokoyo, commands that I repeat to you: ‘We will now send you back to your own people and country.",
    "As for the seven children, they are the grandsons and granddaughters of the King, and shall be fitly cared for.",
    "Do not, therefore, allow your mind to be troubled concerning them.’”",
    "On receiving this mandate, Akinosuké submissively prepared for his departure.",
    "When all his affairs had been settled, and the ceremony of bidding farewell to his counselors and trusted officials had been concluded, he was escorted with much honor to the port.",
    "There he embarked upon the ship sent for him; and the ship sailed out into the blue sea, under the blue sky; and the shape of the island of Raishū itself turned blue, and then turned grey, and then vanished forever...",
    "And Akinosuké suddenly awoke—under the cedar-tree in his own garden!",
    "For a moment he was stupefied and dazed.",
    "But he perceived his two friends still seated near him,—drinking and chatting merrily.",
    "He stared at them in a bewildered way, and cried aloud,— “How strange!”",
    "“Akinosuké must have been dreaming,” one of them exclaimed, with a laugh.",
    "“What did you see, Akinosuké, that was strange?”",
    "Then Akinosuké told his dream,—that dream of three-and-twenty years’ sojourn in the realm of Tokoyo, in the island of Raishū;—and they were astonished, because he had really slept for no more than a few minutes.",
    "One gōshi said:— “Indeed, you saw strange things.",
    "We also saw something strange while you were napping.",
    "A little yellow butterfly was fluttering over your face for a moment or two; and we watched it.",
    "Then it alighted on the ground beside you, close to the tree; and almost as soon as it alighted there, a big, big ant came out of a hole and seized it and pulled it down into the hole.",
    "Just before you woke up, we saw that very butterfly come out of the hole again, and flutter over your face as before.",
    "And then it suddenly disappeared: we do not know where it went.”",
    "“Perhaps it was Akinosuké’s soul,” the other gōshi",
    "said;—“certainly I thought I saw it fly into his mouth...",
    "But, even if that butterfly _was_ Akinosuké’s soul, the fact would not explain his dream.”",
    "“The ants might explain it,” returned the first speaker.",
    "“Ants are queer beings—possibly goblins...",
    "Anyhow, there is a big ant’s nest under that cedar-tree.”...",
    "“Let us look!” cried Akinosuké, greatly moved by this suggestion.",
    "And he went for a spade.",
    "The ground about and beneath the cedar-tree proved to have been excavated, in a most surprising way, by a prodigious colony of ants.",
    "The ants had furthermore built inside their excavations; and their tiny constructions of straw, clay, and stems bore an odd resemblance to miniature towns.",
    "In the middle of a structure considerably larger than the rest there was a marvelous swarming of small ants around the body of one very big ant, which had yellowish wings and a long black head.",
    "“Why, there is the King of my dream!”",
    "cried Akinosuké; “and there is the palace of Tokoyo!...",
    "How extraordinary!...",
    "Raishū ought to lie somewhere southwest of it—to the left of that big root...",
    "Yes!—here it is!...",
    "How very strange!",
    "Now I am sure that I can find the mountain of Hanryōkō, and the grave of the princess.”...",
    "In the wreck of the nest he searched and searched, and at last discovered a tiny mound, on the top of which was fixed a water-worn pebble, in shape resembling a Buddhist monument.",
    "Underneath it he found—embedded in clay—the dead body of a female ant.",
    "RIKI-BAKA",
    "His name was Riki, signifying Strength; but the people called him Riki-the-Simple, or Riki-the-Fool,—“Riki-Baka,”—because he had been born into perpetual childhood.",
    "For the same reason they were kind to him,—even when he set a house on fire by putting a lighted match to a mosquito-curtain, and clapped his hands for joy to see the blaze.",
    "At sixteen years he was a tall, strong lad; but in mind he remained always at the happy age of two, and therefore continued to play with very small children.",
    "The bigger children of the neighborhood, from four to seven years old, did not care to play with him, because he could not learn their songs and games.",
    "His favorite toy was a broomstick, which he used as a hobby-horse; and for hours at a time he would ride on that broomstick, up and down the slope in front of my house, with amazing peals of laughter.",
    "But at last he became troublesome by reason of his noise; and I had to tell him that he must find another playground.",
    "He bowed submissively, and then went off,—sorrowfully trailing his broomstick behind him.",
    "Gentle at all times, and perfectly harmless if allowed no chance to play with fire, he seldom gave anybody cause for complaint.",
    "His relation to the life of our street was scarcely more than that of a dog or a chicken; and when he finally disappeared, I did not miss him.",
    "Months and months passed by before anything happened to remind me of Riki.",
    "“What has become of Riki?”",
    "I then asked the old woodcutter who supplies our neighborhood with fuel.",
    "I remembered that Riki had often helped him to carry his bundles.",
    "“Riki-Baka?” answered the old man.",
    "“Ah, Riki is dead—poor fellow!...",
    "Yes, he died nearly a year ago, very suddenly; the doctors said that he had some disease of the brain.",
    "And there is a strange story now about that poor Riki.",
    "“When Riki died, his mother wrote his name, ‘Riki-Baka,’ in the palm of his left hand,—putting ‘Riki’ in the Chinese character, and ‘Baka’ in _kana_ (1).",
    "And she repeated many prayers for him,—prayers that he might be reborn into some more happy condition.",
    "“Now, about three months ago, in the honorable residence of Nanigashi-Sama (2), in Kojimachi (3), a boy was born with characters on the palm of his left hand; and the characters were quite plain to read,—‘_RIKI-BAKA_’!",
    "“So the people of that house knew that the birth must have happened in answer to somebody’s prayer; and they caused inquiry to be made everywhere.",
    "At last a vegetable-seller brought word to them that there used to be a simple lad, called Riki-Baka, living in the Ushigomé quarter, and that he had died during the last autumn; and they sent two men-servants to look for the mother of Riki.",
    "“Those servants found the mother of Riki, and told her what had happened; and she was glad exceedingly—for that Nanigashi house is a very rich and famous house.",
    "But the servants said that the family of Nanigashi-Sama were very angry about the word ‘Baka’ on the child’s hand.",
    "‘And where is your Riki buried?’",
    "the servants asked.",
    "‘He is buried in the cemetery of Zendōji,’ she told them.",
    "‘Please to give us some of the clay of his grave,’ they requested.",
    "“So she went with them to the temple Zendōji, and showed them Riki’s grave; and they took some of the grave-clay away with them, wrapped up in a _furoshiki_[1]]....",
    "They gave Riki’s mother some money,—ten yen.”...",
    "(4) “But what did they want with that clay?”",
    "I inquired.",
    "“Well,” the old man answered, “you know that it would not do to let the child grow up with that name on his hand.",
    "And there is no other means of removing characters that come in that way upon the body of a child: _you must rub the skin with clay taken from the grave of the body of the former birth_.”...",
    "HI-MAWARI On the wooded hill behind the house",
    "Robert and I are looking for fairy-rings.",
    "Robert is eight years old, comely, and very wise;—I am a little more than seven,—and",
    "I reverence Robert.",
    "It is a glowing glorious August day; and the warm air is filled with sharp sweet scents of resin.",
    "We do not find any fairy-rings; but we find a great many pine-cones in the high grass...",
    "I tell Robert the old Welsh story of the man who went to sleep, unawares, inside a fairy-ring, and so disappeared for seven years, and would never eat or speak after his friends had delivered him from the enchantment.",
    "“They eat nothing but the points of needles, you know,” says Robert.",
    "“Who?” I ask.",
    "“Goblins,” Robert answers.",
    "This revelation leaves me dumb with astonishment and awe...",
    "But Robert suddenly cries out:— “There is a Harper!—he is coming to the house!”",
    "And down the hill we run to hear the harper...",
    "But what a harper!",
    "Not like the hoary minstrels of the picture-books.",
    "A swarthy, sturdy, unkempt vagabond, with black bold eyes under scowling black brows.",
    "More like a bricklayer than a bard,—and his garments are corduroy!",
    "“Wonder if he is going to sing in Welsh?” murmurs Robert.",
    "I feel too much disappointed to make any remarks.",
    "The harper poses his harp—a huge instrument—upon our doorstep, sets all the strong ringing with a sweep of his grimy fingers, clears his throat with a sort of angry growl, and begins,— Believe me,",
    "if all those endearing young charms, Which I gaze on so fondly to-day...",
    "The accent, the attitude, the voice, all fill me with repulsion unutterable,—shock me with a new sensation of formidable vulgarity.",
    "I want to cry out loud, “You have no right to sing that song!”",
    "For I have heard it sung by the lips of the dearest and fairest being in my little world;—and that this rude, coarse man should dare to sing it vexes me like a mockery,—angers me like an insolence.",
    "But only for a moment!...",
    "With the utterance of the syllables “to-day,” that deep, grim voice suddenly breaks into a quivering tenderness indescribable;—then, marvelously changing, it mellows into tones sonorous and rich as the bass of a great organ,—while a sensation unlike anything ever felt before takes me by the throat...",
    "What witchcraft has he learned?",
    "what secret has he found—this scowling man of the road?...",
    "Oh! is there anybody else in the whole world who can sing like that?...",
    "And the form of the singer flickers and dims;—and the house, and the lawn, and all visible shapes of things tremble and swim before me.",
    "Yet instinctively I fear that man;—I almost hate him; and I feel myself flushing with anger and shame because of his power to move me thus...",
    "“He made you cry,” Robert compassionately observes, to my further confusion,—as the harper strides away, richer by a gift of sixpence taken without thanks...",
    "“But I think he must be a gipsy.",
    "Gipsies are bad people—and they are wizards... Let us go back to the wood.”",
    "We climb again to the pines, and there squat down upon the sun-flecked grass, and look over town and sea.",
    "But we do not play as before: the spell of the wizard is strong upon us both...",
    "“Perhaps he is a goblin,” I venture at last, “or a fairy?”",
    "“No,” says Robert,—“only a gipsy.",
    "But that is nearly as bad.",
    "They steal children, you know.”...",
    "“What shall we do if he comes up here?”",
    "I gasp, in sudden terror at the lonesomeness of our situation.",
    "“Oh, he wouldn’t dare,” answers Robert—“not by daylight, you know.”...",
    "[Only yesterday, near the village of Takata, I noticed a flower which the Japanese call by nearly the same name as we do: _Himawari_, “The Sunward-turning;”—and over the space of forty years there thrilled back to me the voice of that wandering harper,— As the Sunflower turns on her god, when he sets, The same look that she turned when he rose.",
    "Again I saw the sun-flecked shadows on that far Welsh hill; and Robert for a moment again stood beside me, with his girl’s face and his curls of gold.",
    "We were looking for fairy-rings...",
    "But all that existed of the real Robert must long ago have suffered a sea-change into something rich and strange... _",
    "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend_....]",
    "HŌRAI Blue vision of depth lost in height,—sea and sky interblending through luminous haze.",
    "The day is of spring, and the hour morning.",
    "Only sky and sea,—one azure enormity...",
    "In the fore, ripples are catching a silvery light, and threads of foam are swirling.",
    "But a little further off no motion is visible, nor anything save color: dim warm blue of water widening away to melt into blue of air.",
    "Horizon there is none: only distance soaring into space,—infinite concavity hollowing before you, and hugely arching above you,—the color deepening with the height.",
    "But far in the midway-blue there hangs a faint, faint vision of palace towers, with high roofs horned and curved like moons,—some shadowing of splendor strange and old, illumined by a sunshine soft as memory.",
    "...",
    "What I have thus been trying to describe is a kakémono,—that is to say, a Japanese painting on silk, suspended to the wall of my alcove;—and the name of it is SHINKIRŌ, which signifies “Mirage.”",
    "But the shapes of the mirage are unmistakable.",
    "Those are the glimmering portals of Hōrai the blest; and those are the moony roofs of the Palace of the Dragon-King;—and the fashion of them (though limned by a Japanese brush of to-day) is the fashion of things Chinese, twenty-one hundred years ago...",
    "Thus much is told of the place in the Chinese books of that time:— In Hōrai there is neither death nor pain; and there is no winter.",
    "The flowers in that place never fade, and the fruits never fail; and if a man taste of those fruits even but once, he can never again feel thirst or hunger.",
    "In Hōrai grow the enchanted plants _",
    "So-rin-shi_, and _Riku-gō-aoi_, and _Ban-kon-tō_, which heal all manner of sickness;—and there grows also the magical grass _Yō-shin-shi_, that quickens the dead; and the magical grass is watered by a fairy water of which a single drink confers perpetual youth.",
    "The people of Hōrai eat their rice out of very, very small bowls; but the rice never diminishes within those bowls,—however much of it be eaten,—until the eater desires no more.",
    "And the people of Hōrai drink their wine out of very, very small cups; but no man can empty one of those cups,—however stoutly he may drink,—until there comes upon him the pleasant drowsiness of intoxication.",
    "All this and more is told in the legends of the time of the Shin dynasty.",
    "But that the people who wrote down those legends ever saw Hōrai, even in a mirage, is not believable.",
    "For really there are no enchanted fruits which leave the eater forever satisfied,—nor any magical grass which revives the dead,—nor any fountain of fairy water,—nor any bowls which never lack rice,—nor any cups which never lack wine.",
    "It is not true that sorrow and death never enter Hōrai;—neither is it true that there is not any winter.",
    "The winter in Hōrai is cold;—and winds then bite to the bone; and the heaping of snow is monstrous on the roofs of the Dragon-King.",
    "Nevertheless there are wonderful things in Hōrai; and the most wonderful of all has not been mentioned by any Chinese writer.",
    "I mean the atmosphere of Hōrai.",
    "It is an atmosphere peculiar to the place; and, because of it, the sunshine in Hōrai is _whiter_ than any other sunshine,—a milky light that never dazzles,—astonishingly clear, but very soft.",
    "This atmosphere is not of our human period: it is enormously old,—so old that I feel afraid when I try to think how old it is;—and it is not a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen.",
    "It is not made of air at all, but of ghost,—the substance of quintillions of quintillions of generations of souls blended into one immense translucency,—souls of people who thought in ways never resembling our ways.",
    "Whatever mortal man inhales that atmosphere, he takes into his blood the thrilling of these spirits; and they change the sense within him,—reshaping his notions of Space and Time,—so that he can see only as they used to see, and feel only as they used to feel, and think only as they used to think.",
    "Soft as sleep are these changes of sense; and Hōrai, discerned across them, might thus be described:— _—Because in Hōrai there is no knowledge of great evil, the hearts of the people never grow old.",
    "And, by reason of being always young in heart, the people of Hōrai smile from birth until death—except when the Gods send sorrow among them; and faces then are veiled until the sorrow goes away.",
    "All folk in Hōrai love and trust each other, as if all were members of a single household;—and the speech of the women is like birdsong, because the hearts of them are light as the souls of birds;—and the swaying of the sleeves of the maidens at play seems a flutter of wide, soft wings.",
    "In Hōrai nothing is hidden but grief, because there is no reason for shame;—and nothing is locked away, because there could not be any theft;—and by night as well as by day all doors remain unbarred, because there is no reason for fear.",
    "And because the people are fairies—though mortal—all things in Hōrai, except the Palace of the Dragon-King, are small and quaint and queer;—and these fairy-folk do really eat their rice out of very, very small bowls, and drink their wine out of very, very small cups...._ —Much of this seeming would be due to the inhalation of that ghostly atmosphere—but not all.",
    "For the spell wrought by the dead is only the charm of an Ideal, the glamour of an ancient hope;—and something of that hope has found fulfillment in many hearts,—in the simple beauty of unselfish lives,—in the sweetness of Woman... —Evil winds from the West are blowing over Hōrai; and the magical atmosphere, alas! is shrinking away before them.",
    "It lingers now in patches only, and bands,—like those long bright bands of cloud that train across the landscapes of Japanese painters.",
    "Under these shreds of the elfish vapor you still can find Hōrai—but not everywhere...",
    "Remember that Hōrai is also called Shinkirō, which signifies Mirage,—the Vision of the Intangible.",
    "And the Vision is fading,—never again to appear save in pictures and poems and dreams...",
    "INSECT STUDIES BUTTERFLIES I Would that I could hope for the luck of that Chinese scholar known to Japanese literature as “Rōsan”!",
    "For he was beloved by two spirit-maidens, celestial sisters, who every ten days came to visit him and to tell him stories about butterflies.",
    "Now there are marvelous Chinese stories about butterflies—ghostly stories; and I want to know them.",
    "But never shall I be able to read Chinese, nor even Japanese; and the little Japanese poetry that I manage, with exceeding difficulty, to translate, contains so many allusions to Chinese stories of butterflies that I am tormented with the torment of Tantalus...",
    "And, of course, no spirit-maidens will even deign to visit so skeptical a person as myself.",
    "I want to know, for example, the whole story of that Chinese maiden whom the butterflies took to be a flower, and followed in multitude,—so fragrant and so fair was she.",
    "Also I should like to know something more concerning the butterflies of the Emperor Gensō, or Ming Hwang, who made them choose his loves for him...",
    "He used to hold wine-parties in his amazing garden; and ladies of exceeding beauty were in attendance; and caged butterflies, set free among them, would fly to the fairest; and then, upon that fairest the Imperial favor was bestowed.",
    "But after Gensō Kōtei had seen Yōkihi (whom the Chinese call Yang-Kwei-Fei), he would not suffer the butterflies to choose for him,—which was unlucky, as Yokihi got him into serious trouble...",
    "Again, I should like to know more about the experience of that Chinese scholar, celebrated in Japan under the name Sōshū, who dreamed that he was a butterfly, and had all the sensations of a butterfly in that dream.",
    "For his spirit had really been wandering about in the shape of a butterfly; and, when he awoke, the memories and the feelings of butterfly existence remained so vivid in his mind that he could not act like a human being...",
    "Finally I should like to know the text of a certain Chinese official recognition of sundry butterflies as the spirits of an Emperor and of his attendants...",
    "Most of the Japanese literature about butterflies, excepting some poetry, appears to be of Chinese origin; and even that old national aæsthetic feeling on the subject, which found such delightful expression in Japanese art and song and custom, may have been first developed under Chinese teaching.",
    "Chinese precedent doubtless explains why Japanese poets and painters chose so often for their _geimyō_, or professional appellations, such names as _Chōmu_ (“Butterfly-Dream),” _Ichō_ (“Solitary Butterfly),” etc.",
    "And even to this day such _geimyō_ as _Chōhana_ (“Butterfly-Blossom”), _Chōkichi_ (“Butterfly-Luck”), or _Chōnosuké_ (“Butterfly-Help”), are affected by dancing-girls.",
    "Besides artistic names having reference to butterflies, there are still in use real personal names (_yobina_) of this kind,—such as Kochō, or Chō, meaning “Butterfly.”",
    "They are borne by women only, as a rule,—though there are some strange exceptions...",
    "And here I may mention that, in the province of Mutsu, there still exists the curious old custom of calling the youngest daughter in a family _Tekona_,—which quaint word, obsolete elsewhere, signifies in Mutsu dialect a butterfly.",
    "In classic time this word signified also a beautiful woman...",
    "It is possible also that some weird Japanese beliefs about butterflies are of Chinese derivation; but these beliefs might be older than China herself.",
    "The most interesting one, I think, is that the soul of a _living_ person may wander about in the form of a butterfly.",
    "Some pretty fancies have been evolved out of this belief,—such as the notion that if a butterfly enters your guest-room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you.",
    "That a butterfly may be the spirit of somebody is not a reason for being afraid of it.",
    "Nevertheless there are times when even butterflies can inspire fear by appearing in prodigious numbers; and Japanese history records such an event.",
    "When Taïra-no-Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyōto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened,—thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil...",
    "Perhaps those butterflies were supposed to be the spirits of the thousands doomed to perish in battle, and agitated on the eve of war by some mysterious premonition of death.",
    "However, in Japanese belief, a butterfly may be the soul of a dead person as well as of a living person.",
    "Indeed it is a custom of souls to take butterfly-shape in order to announce the fact of their final departure from the body; and for this reason any butterfly which enters a house ought to be kindly treated.",
    "To this belief, and to queer fancies connected with it, there are many allusions in popular drama.",
    "For example, there is a well-known play called _Tondé-déru-Kochō-no-Kanzashi;_ or, “The Flying Hairpin of Kochō.”",
    "Kochō is a beautiful person who kills herself because of false accusations and cruel treatment.",
    "Her would-be avenger long seeks in vain for the author of the wrong.",
    "But at last the dead woman’s hairpin turns into a butterfly, and serves as a guide to vengeance by hovering above the place where the villain is hiding.",
    "—Of course those big paper butterflies (_o-chō_ and _mé-chō_) which figure at weddings must not be thought of as having any ghostly signification.",
    "As emblems they only express the joy of living union, and the hope that the newly married couple may pass through life together as a pair of butterflies flit lightly through some pleasant garden,—now hovering upward, now downward, but never widely separating.",
    "II",
    "A small selection of _hokku_ (1) on butterflies will help to illustrate Japanese interest in the aæsthetic side of the subject.",
    "Some are pictures only,—tiny color-sketches made with seventeen syllables; some are nothing more than pretty fancies, or graceful suggestions;—but the reader will find variety.",
    "Probably he will not care much for the verses in themselves.",
    "The taste for Japanese poetry of the epigrammatic sort is a taste that must be slowly acquired; and it is only by degrees, after patient study, that the possibilities of such composition can be fairly estimated.",
    "Hasty criticism has declared that to put forward any serious claim on behalf of seventeen-syllable poems “would be absurd.”",
    "But what, then, of Crashaw’s famous line upon the miracle at the marriage feast in Cana?—",
    "Nympha pudica Deum vidit, et erubuit.[1]",
    "Only fourteen syllables—and immortality.",
    "Now with seventeen Japanese syllables things quite as wonderful—indeed, much more wonderful—have been done, not once or twice, but probably a thousand times...",
    "However, there is nothing wonderful in the following _hokku_, which have been selected for more than literary reasons:— Nugi-kakuru[2] Haori sugata no Kochō kana!",
    "[_Like a_ haori _being taken off—that is the shape of a butterfly!_]",
    "Torisashi no Sao",

    "Chōchō ya!",
    "Onna no michi",
    "no Ato ya saki!",
    "[_See that butterfly on the woman’s path,—now fluttering behind her, now before!_]",
    "Chōchō ya!",
    "Hana-nusubito wo Tsukété-yuku!",
    "[_Ha!",
    "the butterfly!—it is following the person who stole the flowers!_]",
    "Aki no chō Tomo nakéréba ya; Hito ni tsuku [_Poor autumn butterfly!—when left without a comrade_ (of its own race), _it follows after man_ (or “a person”)!]",
    "Owarété mo, Isoganu furi no Chōcho kana!",
    "[_Ah, the butterfly!",
    "Even when chased, it never has the air of being in a hurry.",
    "_]",
    "Chō wa mina Jiu-shichi-hachi no Sugata kana!",
    "[_As for butterflies, they all have the appearance of being about seventeen or eighteen years old._[9]] Chō tobu ya— Kono yo no urami",
    "Naki yō ni!",
    "[_How the butterfly sports,—just as if there were no enmity_ (or “envy”) _in this world!",
    "_]",
    "Chō tobu ya, Kono yo ni nozomi Nai yō ni!",
    "[_Ah, the butterfly!—it sports about as if it had nothing more to desire in this present state of existence.",
    "_]",
    "Nami no hana ni Tomari kanétaru, Kochō kana!",
    "[_Having found it difficult indeed to perch upon the_ (_foam_-) _blossoms of the waves,—alas for the butterfly!_]",
    "Mutsumashi ya!—",
    "Umaré-kawareba Nobé no chō.[10]",
    "[_If_ (in our next existence)",
    "_we be born into the state of butterflies upon the moor, then perchance we may be happy together!_]",
    "Nadéshiko ni Chōchō shiroshi— Taré no kon?[11]",
    "[_On the pink-flower there is a white butterfly: whose spirit, I wonder?_]",

    "Chō wo oü Kokoro-mochitashi Itsumadémo!",
    "[_Would that I might always have the heart_ (desire) _of chasing butterflies!_[12]] Besides these specimens of poetry about butterflies, I have one queer example to offer of Japanese prose literature on the same topic.",
    "The original, of which I have attempted only a free translation, can be found in the curious old book _Mushi-Isamé_ (“Insect-Admonitions”); and it assumes the form of a discourse to a butterfly.",
    "But it is really a didactic allegory,—suggesting the moral significance of a social rise and fall:— “Now, under the sun of spring, the winds are gentle, and flowers pinkly bloom, and grasses are soft, and the hearts of people are glad.",
    "Butterflies everywhere flutter joyously: so many persons now compose Chinese verses and Japanese verses about butterflies.",
    "“And this season, O Butterfly, is indeed the season of your bright prosperity: so comely you now are that in the whole world there is nothing more comely.",
    "For that reason all other insects admire and envy you;—there is not among them even one that does not envy you.",
    "Nor do insects alone regard you with envy: men also both envy and admire you.",
    "Sōshū of China, in a dream, assumed your shape;—Sakoku of Japan, after dying, took your form, and therein made ghostly apparition.",
    "Nor is the envy that you inspire shared only by insects and mankind: even things without soul change their form into yours;—witness the barley-grass, which turns into a butterfly.[13] “And therefore you are lifted up with pride, and think to yourself: ‘In all this world there is nothing superior to me!’",
    "Ah!",
    "I can very well guess what is in your heart: you are too much satisfied with your own person.",
    "That is why you let yourself be blown thus lightly about by every wind;—that is why you never remain still,—always, always thinking, ‘In the whole world there is no one so fortunate as I.’",
    "“But now try to think a little about your own personal history.",
    "It is worth recalling; for there is a vulgar side to it.",
    "How a vulgar side?",
    "Well, for a considerable time after you were born, you had no such reason for rejoicing in your form.",
    "You were then a mere cabbage-insect, a hairy worm; and you were so poor that you could not afford even one robe to cover your nakedness; and your appearance was altogether disgusting.",
    "Everybody in those days hated the sight of you.",
    "Indeed you had good reason to be ashamed of yourself; and so ashamed you were that you collected old twigs and rubbish to hide in, and you made a hiding-nest, and hung it to a branch,—and",
    "then everybody cried out to you, ‘Raincoat Insect!’",
    "(_Mino-mushi_.)[14]",
    "And during that period of your life, your sins were grievous.",
    "Among the tender green leaves of beautiful cherry-trees you and your fellows assembled, and there made ugliness extraordinary; and the expectant eyes of the people, who came from far away to admire the beauty of those cherry-trees, were hurt by the sight of you.",
    "And of things even more hateful than this you were guilty.",
    "You knew that poor, poor men and women had been cultivating _daikon_ (2) in their fields,—toiling under the hot sun till their hearts were filled with bitterness by reason of having to care for that _daikon;_ and you persuaded your companions to go with you, and to gather upon the leaves of that _daikon_, and on the leaves of other vegetables planted by those poor people.",
    "Out of your greediness you ravaged those leaves, and gnawed them into all shapes of ugliness,—caring nothing for the trouble of those poor folk...",
    "Yes, such a creature you were, and such were your doings.",
    "“And now that you have a comely form, you despise your old comrades, the insects; and, whenever you happen to meet any of them, you pretend not to know them [literally, ‘You make an I-don’t-know face’].",
    "Now you want to have none but wealthy and exalted people for friends...",
    "Ah!",
    "You have forgotten the old times, have you?",
    "“It is true that many people have forgotten your past, and are charmed by the sight of your present graceful shape and white wings, and write Chinese verses and Japanese verses about you.",
    "The high-born damsel, who could not bear even to look at you in your former shape, now gazes at you with delight, and wants you to perch upon her hairpin, and holds out her dainty fan in the hope that you will light upon it.",
    "But this reminds me that there is an ancient Chinese story about you, which is not pretty.",
    "“In the time of the Emperor Gensō, the Imperial Palace contained hundreds and thousands of beautiful ladies,—so many, indeed, that it would have been difficult for any man to decide which among them was the loveliest.",
    "So all of those beautiful persons were assembled together in one place; and you were set free to fly among them; and it was decreed that the damsel upon whose hairpin you perched should be augustly summoned to the Imperial Chamber.",
    "In that time there could not be more than one Empress—which was a good law; but, because of you, the Emperor Gensō did great mischief in the land.",
    "For your mind is light and frivolous; and although among so many beautiful women there must have been some persons of pure heart, you would look for nothing but beauty, and so betook yourself to the person most beautiful in outward appearance.",
    "Therefore many of the female attendants ceased altogether to think about the right way of women, and began to study how to make themselves appear splendid in the eyes of men.",
    "And the end of it was that the Emperor Gensō died a pitiful and painful death—all because of your light and trifling mind.",
    "Indeed, your real character can easily be seen from your conduct in other matters.",
    "There are trees, for example,—such as the evergreen-oak and the pine,—whose leaves do not fade and fall, but remain always green;—these are trees of firm heart, trees of solid character.",
    "But you say that they are stiff and formal; and you hate the sight of them, and never pay them a visit.",
    "Only to the cherry-tree, and the _kaido_[15], and the peony, and the yellow rose you go: those you like because they have showy flowers, and you try only to please them.",
    "Such conduct, let me assure you, is very unbecoming.",
    "Those trees certainly have handsome flowers; but hunger-satisfying fruits they have not; and they are grateful to those only who are fond of luxury and show.",
    "And that is just the reason why they are pleased by your fluttering wings and delicate shape;—that is why they are kind to you.",
    "“Now, in this spring season, while you sportively dance through the gardens of the wealthy, or hover among the beautiful alleys of cherry-trees in blossom, you say to yourself: ‘Nobody in the world has such pleasure as I, or such excellent friends.",
    "And, in spite of all that people may say, I most love the peony,—and the golden yellow rose is my own darling, and I will obey her every least behest; for that is my pride and my delight.’...",
    "So you say.",
    "But the opulent and elegant season of flowers is very short: soon they will fade and fall.",
    "Then, in the time of summer heat, there will be green leaves only; and presently the winds of autumn will blow, when even the leaves themselves will shower down like rain, _parari-parari_.",
    "And your fate will then be as the fate of the unlucky in the proverb, _",
    "Tanomi ki no shita ni amé furu_",
    "[Even through the tree upon which I relied for shelter the rain leaks down].",
    "For you will seek out your old friend, the root-cutting insect, the grub, and beg him to let you return into your old-time hole;—but now having wings, you will not be able to enter the hole because of them, and you will not be able to shelter your body anywhere between heaven and earth, and all the moor-grass will then have withered, and you will not have even one drop of dew with which to moisten your tongue,—and there will be nothing left for you to do but to lie down and die.",
    "All because of your light and frivolous heart—but, ah! how lamentable an end!”",
    "...",
    "III Most of the Japanese stories about butterflies appear, as I have said, to be of Chinese origin.",
    "But I have one which is probably indigenous; and it seems to me worth telling for the benefit of persons who believe there is no “romantic love” in the Far East.",
    "Behind the cemetery of the temple of Sōzanji, in the suburbs of the capital, there long stood a solitary cottage, occupied by an old man named Takahama.",
    "He was liked in the neighborhood, by reason of his amiable ways; but almost everybody supposed him to be a little mad.",
    "Unless a man take the Buddhist vows, he is expected to marry, and to bring up a family.",
    "But Takahama did not belong to the religious life; and he could not be persuaded to marry.",
    "Neither had he ever been known to enter into a love-relation with any woman.",
    "For more than fifty years he had lived entirely alone.",
    "One summer he fell sick, and knew that he had not long to live.",
    "He then sent for his sister-in-law, a widow, and for her only son,—a lad of about twenty years old, to whom he was much attached.",
    "Both promptly came, and did whatever they could to soothe the old man’s last hours.",
    "One sultry afternoon, while the widow and her son were watching at his bedside, Takahama fell asleep.",
    "At the same moment a very large white butterfly entered the room, and perched upon the sick man’s pillow.",
    "The nephew drove it away with a fan; but it returned immediately to the pillow, and was again driven away, only to come back a third time.",
    "Then the nephew chased it into the garden, and across the garden, through an open gate, into the cemetery of the neighboring temple.",
    "But it continued to flutter before him as if unwilling to be driven further, and acted so queerly that he began to wonder whether it was really a butterfly, or a _ma_[16].",
    "He again chased it, and followed it far into the cemetery, until he saw it fly against a tomb,—a woman’s tomb.",
    "There it unaccountably disappeared; and he searched for it in vain.",
    "He then examined the monument.",
    "It bore the personal name “Akiko,” (3) together with an unfamiliar family name, and an inscription stating that Akiko had died at the age of eighteen.",
    "Apparently the tomb had been erected about fifty years previously: moss had begun to gather upon it.",
    "But it had been well cared for: there were fresh flowers before it; and the water-tank had recently been filled.",
    "On returning to the sick room, the young man was shocked by the announcement that his uncle had ceased to breathe.",
    "Death had come to the sleeper painlessly; and the dead face smiled.",
    "The young man told his mother of what he had seen in the cemetery.",
    "“Ah!” exclaimed the widow, “then it must have been Akiko!”...",
    "“But who was Akiko, mother?”",
    "the nephew asked.",
    "The widow answered:— “When your good uncle was young he was betrothed to a charming girl called Akiko, the daughter of a neighbor.",
    "Akiko died of consumption, only a little before the day appointed for the wedding; and her promised husband sorrowed greatly.",
    "After Akiko had been buried, he made a vow never to marry; and he built this little house beside the cemetery, so that he might be always near her grave.",
    "All this happened more than fifty years ago.",
    "And every day of those fifty years—winter and summer alike—your uncle went to the cemetery, and prayed at the grave, and swept the tomb, and set offerings before it.",
    "But he did not like to have any mention made of the matter; and he never spoke of it...",
    "So, at last, Akiko came for him: the white butterfly was her soul.”",
    "IV I had almost forgotten to mention an ancient Japanese dance, called the Butterfly Dance (_Kochō-Mai_), which used to be performed in the Imperial Palace, by dancers costumed as butterflies.",
    "Whether it is danced occasionally nowadays I do not know.",
    "It is said to be very difficult to learn.",
    "Six dancers are required for the proper performance of it; and they must move in particular figures,—obeying traditional rules for every step, pose, or gesture,—and circling about each other very slowly to the sound of hand-drums and great drums, small flutes and great flutes, and pandean pipes of a form unknown to Western Pan.",
    "[Illustration] BUTTERFLY DANCE MOSQUITOES With a view to self-protection I have been reading Dr. Howard’s book, “Mosquitoes.”",
    "I am persecuted by mosquitoes.",
    "There are several species in my neighborhood; but only one of them is a serious torment,—a tiny needly thing, all silver-speckled and silver-streaked.",
    "The puncture of it is sharp as an electric burn; and the mere hum of it has a lancinating quality of tone which foretells the quality of the pain about to come,—much in the same way that a particular smell suggests a particular taste.",
    "I find that this mosquito much resembles the creature which Dr. Howard calls _Stegomyia fasciata_, or _Culex fasciatus:_ and that its habits are the same as those of the _Stegomyia_.",
    "For example, it is diurnal rather than nocturnal and becomes most troublesome in the afternoon.",
    "And I have discovered that it comes from the Buddhist cemetery,—a very old cemetery,—in the rear of my garden.",
    "Dr. Howard’s book declares that, in order to rid a neighborhood of mosquitoes, it is only necessary to pour a little petroleum, or kerosene oil, into the stagnant water where they breed.",
    "Once a week the oil should be used, “at the rate of once ounce for every fifteen square feet of water-surface, and a proportionate quantity for any less surface.”",
    "...But please to consider the conditions in _my_ neighborhood!",
    "I have said that my tormentors come from the Buddhist cemetery.",
    "Before nearly every tomb in that old cemetery there is a water-receptacle, or cistern, called _mizutamé_.",
    "In the majority of cases this _mizutamé_ is simply an oblong cavity chiseled in the broad pedestal supporting the monument; but before tombs of a costly kind, having no pedestal-tank, a larger separate tank is placed, cut out of a single block of stone, and decorated with a family crest, or with symbolic carvings.",
    "In front of a tomb of the humblest class, having no _mizutamé_, water is placed in cups or other vessels,—for the dead must have water.",
    "Flowers also must be offered to them; and before every tomb you will find a pair of bamboo cups, or other flower-vessels; and these, of course, contain water.",
    "There is a well in the cemetery to supply water for the graves.",
    "Whenever the tombs are visited by relatives and friends of the dead, fresh water is poured into the tanks and cups.",
    "But as an old cemetery of this kind contains thousands of _mizutamé_, and tens of thousands of flower-vessels the water in all of these cannot be renewed every day.",
    "It becomes stagnant and populous.",
    "The deeper tanks seldom get dry;—the rainfall at Tōkyō being heavy enough to keep them partly filled during nine months out of the twelve.",
    "Well, it is in these tanks and flower-vessels that mine enemies are born: they rise by millions from the water of the dead;—and, according to Buddhist doctrine, some of them may be reincarnations of those very dead, condemned by the error of former lives to the condition of _Jiki-ketsu-gaki_, or blood-drinking pretas....",
    "Anyhow the malevolence of the _Culex fasciatus_ would justify the suspicion that some wicked human soul had been compressed into that wailing speck of a body....",
    "Now, to return to the subject of kerosene-oil, you can exterminate the mosquitoes of any locality by covering with a film of kerosene all stagnant water surfaces therein.",
    "The larvae die on rising to breathe; and the adult females perish when they approach the water to launch their rafts of eggs.",
    "And I read, in Dr. Howard’s book, that the actual cost of freeing from mosquitoes one American town of fifty thousand inhabitants, does not exceed three hundred dollars!...",
    "I wonder what would be said if the city-government of Tōkyō—which is aggressively scientific and progressive—were suddenly to command that all water-surfaces in the Buddhist cemeteries should be covered, at regular intervals, with a film of kerosene oil!",
    "How could the religion which prohibits the taking of any life—even of invisible life—yield to such a mandate?",
    "Would filial piety even dream of consenting to obey such an order?",
    "And then to think of the cost, in labor and time, of putting kerosene oil, every seven days, into the millions of _mizutamé_, and the tens of millions of bamboo flower-cups, in the Tōkyō graveyards!...",
    "Impossible!",
    "To free the city from mosquitoes it would be necessary to demolish the ancient graveyards;—and that would signify the ruin of the Buddhist temples attached to them;—and that would mean the disparition of so many charming gardens, with their lotus-ponds and Sanscrit-lettered monuments and humpy bridges and holy groves and weirdly-smiling Buddhas!",
    "So the extermination of the _Culex fasciatus_ would involve the destruction of the poetry of the ancestral cult,—surely too great a price to pay!...",
    "Besides, I should like, when my time comes, to be laid away in some Buddhist graveyard of the ancient kind,—so that my ghostly company should be ancient, caring nothing for the fashions and the changes and the disintegrations of Meiji (1).",
    "That old cemetery behind my garden would be a suitable place.",
    "Everything there is beautiful with a beauty of exceeding and startling queerness; each tree and stone has been shaped by some old, old ideal which no longer exists in any living brain; even the shadows are not of this time and sun, but of a world forgotten, that never knew steam or electricity or magnetism or—kerosene oil!",
    "Also in the boom of the big bell there is a quaintness of tone which wakens feelings, so strangely far-away from all the nineteenth-century part of me, that the faint blind stirrings of them make me afraid,—deliciously afraid.",
    "Never do I hear that billowing peal",
    "but I become aware of a striving and a fluttering in the abyssal part of my ghost,—a sensation as of memories struggling to reach the light beyond the obscurations of a million million deaths and births.",
    "I hope to remain within hearing of that bell...",
    "And, considering the possibility of being doomed to the state of a _Jiki-ketsu-gaki_, I want to have my chance of being reborn in some bamboo flower-cup, or _mizutamé_, whence I might issue softly, singing my thin and pungent song, to bite some people that I know.",
    "ANTS I This morning sky, after the night’s tempest, is a pure and dazzling blue.",
    "The air—the delicious air!—is full of sweet resinous odors, shed from the countless pine-boughs broken and strewn by the gale.",
    "In the neighboring bamboo-grove I hear the flute-call of the bird that praises the Sûtra of the Lotos; and the land is very still by reason of the south wind.",
    "Now the summer, long delayed, is truly with us: butterflies of queer Japanese colors are flickering about; semi (1) are wheezing; wasps are humming; gnats are dancing in the sun; and the ants are busy repairing their damaged habitations...",
    "I bethink me of a Japanese poem:— Yuku é naki:",
    "Ari no sumai ya!",
    "Go-getsu amé.",
    "[_Now the poor creature has nowhere to go!...",
    "Alas for the dwellings of the ants in this rain of the fifth month!_]",
    "But those big black ants in my garden do not seem to need any sympathy.",
    "They have weathered the storm in some unimaginable way, while great trees were being uprooted, and houses blown to fragments, and roads washed out of existence.",
    "Yet, before the typhoon, they took no other visible precaution than to block up the gates of their subterranean town.",
    "And the spectacle of their triumphant toil to-day impels me to attempt an essay on Ants.",
    "I should have liked to preface my disquisitions with something from the old Japanese literature,—something emotional or metaphysical.",
    "But all that my Japanese friends were able to find for me on the subject,—excepting some verses of little worth,—was Chinese.",
    "This Chinese material consisted chiefly of strange stories; and one of them seems to me worth quoting,—_faute de mieux_.",
    "In the province of Taishū, in China, there was a pious man who, every day, during many years, fervently worshiped a certain goddess.",
    "One morning, while he was engaged in his devotions, a beautiful woman, wearing a yellow robe, came into his chamber and stood before him.",
    "He, greatly surprised, asked her what she wanted, and why she had entered unannounced.",
    "She answered: “I am not a woman: I am the goddess whom you have so long and so faithfully worshiped; and I have now come to prove to you that your devotion has not been in vain...",
    "Are you acquainted with the language of Ants?”",
    "The worshiper replied: “I am only a low-born and ignorant person,—not a scholar; and even of the language of superior men I know nothing.”",
    "At these words the goddess smiled, and drew from her bosom a little box, shaped like an incense box.",
    "She opened the box, dipped a finger into it, and took therefrom some kind of ointment with which she anointed the ears of the man.",
    "“Now,” she said to him, “try to find some Ants, and when you find any, stoop down, and listen carefully to their talk.",
    "You will be able to understand it; and you will hear of something to your advantage...",
    "Only remember that you must not frighten or vex the Ants.”",
    "Then the goddess vanished away.",
    "The man immediately went out to look for some Ants.",
    "He had scarcely crossed the threshold of his door when he perceived two Ants upon a stone supporting one of the house-pillars.",
    "He stooped over them, and listened; and he was astonished to find that he could hear them talking, and could understand what they said.",
    "“Let us try to find a warmer place,” proposed one of the Ants.",
    "“Why a warmer place?” asked the other;—“what is the matter with this place?”",
    "“It is too damp and cold below,” said the first Ant; “there is a big treasure buried here; and the sunshine cannot warm the ground about it.”",
    "Then the two Ants went away together, and the listener ran for a spade.",
    "By digging in the neighborhood of the pillar, he soon found a number of large jars full of gold coin.",
    "The discovery of this treasure made him a very rich man.",
    "Afterwards he often tried to listen to the conversation of Ants.",
    "But he was never again able to hear them speak.",
    "The ointment of the goddess had opened his ears to their mysterious language for only a single day.",
    "Now I, like that Chinese devotee, must confess myself a very ignorant person, and naturally unable to hear the conversation of Ants.",
    "But the Fairy of Science sometimes touches my ears and eyes with her wand; and then, for a little time, I am able to hear things inaudible, and to perceive things imperceptible.",
    "II",
    "For the same reason that it is considered wicked, in sundry circles, to speak of a non-Christian people having produced a civilization ethically superior to our own, certain persons will not be pleased by what I am going to say about ants.",
    "But there are men, incomparably wiser than I can ever hope to be, who think about insects and civilizations independently of the blessings of Christianity; and I find encouragement in the new _Cambridge Natural History_, which contains the following remarks by Professor David Sharp, concerning ants:— “Observation has revealed the most remarkable phenomena in the lives of these insects.",
    "Indeed we can scarcely avoid the conclusion that they have acquired, in many respects, the art of living together in societies more perfectly than our own species has; and that they have anticipated us in the acquisition of some of the industries and arts that greatly facilitate social life.”",
    "I suppose that a few well-informed persons will dispute this plain statement by a trained specialist.",
    "The contemporary man of science is not apt to become sentimental about ants or bees; but he will not hesitate to acknowledge that, in regard to social evolution, these insects appear to have advanced “beyond man.”",
    "Mr. Herbert Spencer, whom nobody will charge with romantic tendencies, goes considerably further than Professor Sharp; showing us that ants are, in a very real sense, _ethically_ as well as economically in advance of humanity,—their lives being entirely devoted to altruistic ends.",
    "Indeed, Professor Sharp somewhat needlessly qualifies his praise of the ant with this cautious observation:— “The competence of the ant is not like that of man.",
    "It is devoted to the welfare of the species rather than to that of the individual, which is, as it were, sacrificed or specialized for the benefit of the community.”",
    "—The obvious implication,—that any social state, in which the improvement of the individual is sacrificed to the common welfare, leaves much to be desired,—is probably correct, from the actual human standpoint.",
    "For man is yet imperfectly evolved; and human society has much to gain from his further individualization.",
    "But in regard to social insects the implied criticism is open to question.",
    "“The improvement of the individual,” says Herbert Spencer, “consists in the better fitting of him for social cooperation; and this, being conducive to social prosperity, is conducive to the maintenance of the race.”",
    "In other words, the value of the individual can be _only_ in relation to the society; and this granted, whether the sacrifice of the individual for the sake of that society be good or evil must depend upon what the society might gain or lose through a further individualization of its members...",
    "But as we shall presently see, the conditions of ant-society that most deserve our attention are the ethical conditions; and these are beyond human criticism, since they realize that ideal of moral evolution described by Mr. Spencer as “a state in which egoism and altruism are so conciliated that the one merges into the other.”",
    "That is to say, a state in which the only possible pleasure is the pleasure of unselfish action.",
    "Or, again to quote Mr. Spencer, the activities of the insect-society are “activities which postpone individual well-being so completely to the well-being of the community that individual life appears to be attended to only just so far as is necessary to make possible due attention to social life,... the individual taking only just such food and just such rest as are needful to maintain its vigor.”",
    "III I hope my reader is aware that ants practise horticulture and agriculture; that they are skillful in the cultivation of mushrooms; that they have domesticated (according to present knowledge) five hundred and eighty-four different kinds of animals; that they make tunnels through solid rock; that they know how to provide against atmospheric changes which might endanger the health of their children; and that, for insects, their longevity is exceptional,—members of the more highly evolved species living for a considerable number of years.",
    "But it is not especially of these matters that I wish to speak.",
    "What I want to talk about is the awful propriety, the terrible morality, of the ant[1].",
    "Our most appalling ideals of conduct fall short of the ethics of the ant,—as progress is reckoned in time,—by nothing less than millions of years!...",
    "When I say “the ant,” I mean the highest type of ant,—not, of course, the entire ant-family.",
    "About two thousand species of ants are already known; and these exhibit, in their social organizations, widely varying degrees of evolution.",
    "Certain social phenomena of the greatest biological importance, and of no less importance in their strange relation to the subject of ethics, can be studied to advantage only in the existence of the most highly evolved societies of ants.",
    "After all that has been written of late years about the probable value of relative experience in the long life of the ant, I suppose that few persons would venture to deny individual character to the ant.",
    "The intelligence of the little creature in meeting and overcoming difficulties of a totally new kind, and in adapting itself to conditions entirely foreign to its experience, proves a considerable power of independent thinking.",
    "But this at least is certain: that the ant has no individuality capable of being exercised in a purely selfish direction;—I am using the word “selfish” in its ordinary acceptation.",
    "A greedy ant, a sensual ant, an ant capable of any one of the seven deadly sins, or even of a small venial sin, is unimaginable.",
    "Equally unimaginable, of course, a romantic ant, an ideological ant, a poetical ant, or an ant inclined to metaphysical speculations.",
    "No human mind could attain to the absolute matter-of-fact quality of the ant-mind;—no human being, as now constituted, could cultivate a mental habit so impeccably practical as that of the ant.",
    "But this superlatively practical mind is incapable of moral error.",
    "It would be difficult, perhaps, to prove that the ant has no religious ideas.",
    "But it is certain that such ideas could not be of any use to it.",
    "The being incapable of moral weakness is beyond the need of “spiritual guidance.”",
    "Only in a vague way can we conceive the character of ant-society, and the nature of ant-morality; and to do even this we must try to imagine some yet impossible state of human society and human morals.",
    "Let us, then, imagine a world full of people incessantly and furiously working,—all of whom seem to be women.",
    "No one of these women could be persuaded or deluded into taking a single atom of food more than is needful to maintain her strength; and no one of them ever sleeps a second longer than is necessary to keep her nervous system in good working-order.",
    "And all of them are so peculiarly constituted that the least unnecessary indulgence would result in some derangement of function.",
    "The work daily performed by these female laborers comprises road-making, bridge-building, timber-cutting, architectural construction of numberless kinds, horticulture and agriculture, the feeding and sheltering of a hundred varieties of domestic animals, the manufacture of sundry chemical products, the storage and conservation of countless food-stuffs, and the care of the children of the race.",
    "All this labor is done for the commonwealth—no citizen of which is capable even of thinking about “property,” except as a _res publica;_—and the sole object of the commonwealth is the nurture and training of its young,—nearly all of whom are girls.",
    "The period of infancy is long: the children remain for a great while, not only helpless, but shapeless, and withal so delicate that they must be very carefully guarded against the least change of temperature.",
    "Fortunately their nurses understand the laws of health: each thoroughly knows all that she ought to know in regard to ventilation, disinfection, drainage, moisture, and the danger of germs,—germs being as visible, perhaps, to her myopic sight as they become to our own eyes under the microscope.",
    "Indeed, all matters of hygiene are so well comprehended that no nurse ever makes a mistake about the sanitary conditions of her neighborhood.",
    "In spite of this perpetual labor no worker remains unkempt: each is scrupulously neat, making her toilet many times a day.",
    "But as every worker is born with the most beautiful of combs and brushes attached to her wrists, no time is wasted in the toilet-room.",
    "Besides keeping themselves strictly clean, the workers must also keep their houses and gardens in faultless order, for the sake of the children.",
    "Nothing less than an earthquake, an eruption, an inundation, or a desperate war, is allowed to interrupt the daily routine of dusting, sweeping, scrubbing, and disinfecting.",
    "IV Now for stranger facts:— This world of incessant toil is a more than Vestal world.",
    "It is true that males can sometimes be perceived in it; but they appear only at particular seasons, and they have nothing whatever to do with the workers or with the work.",
    "None of them would presume to address a worker,—except, perhaps, under extraordinary circumstances of common peril.",
    "And no worker would think of talking to a male;—for males, in this queer world, are inferior beings, equally incapable of fighting or working, and tolerated only as necessary evils.",
    "One special class of females,—the Mothers-Elect of the race,—do condescend to consort with males, during a very brief period, at particular seasons.",
    "But the Mothers-Elect do not work; and they _must_ accept husbands.",
    "A worker could not even dream of keeping company with a male,—not merely because such association would signify the most frivolous waste of time, nor yet because the worker necessarily regards all males with unspeakable contempt; but because the worker is incapable of wedlock.",
    "Some workers, indeed, are capable of parthenogenesis, and give birth to children who never had fathers.",
    "As a general rule, however, the worker is truly feminine by her moral instincts only: she has all the tenderness, the patience, and the foresight that we call “maternal;” but her sex has disappeared, like the sex of the Dragon-Maiden in the Buddhist legend.",
    "For defense against creatures of prey, or enemies of the state, the workers are provided with weapons; and they are furthermore protected by a large military force.",
    "The warriors are so much bigger than the workers (in some communities, at least) that it is difficult, at first sight, to believe them of the same race.",
    "Soldiers one hundred times larger than the workers whom they guard are not uncommon.",
    "But all these soldiers are Amazons,—or, more correctly speaking, semi-females.",
    "They can work sturdily; but being built for fighting and for heavy pulling chiefly, their usefulness is restricted to those directions in which force, rather than skill, is required.",
    "[Why females, rather than males, should have been evolutionally specialized into soldiery and laborers may not be nearly so simple a question as it appears.",
    "I am very sure of not being able to answer it.",
    "But natural economy may have decided the matter.",
    "In many forms of life, the female greatly exceeds the male in bulk and in energy;—perhaps, in this case, the larger reserve of life-force possessed originally by the complete female could be more rapidly and effectively utilized for the development of a special fighting-caste.",
    "All energies which, in the fertile female, would be expended in the giving of life seem here to have been diverted to the evolution of aggressive power, or working-capacity.]",
    "Of the true females,—the Mothers-Elect,—there are very few indeed; and these are treated like queens.",
    "So constantly and so reverentially are they waited upon that they can seldom have any wishes to express.",
    "They are relieved from every care of existence,—except the duty of bearing offspring.",
    "Night and day they are cared for in every possible manner.",
    "They alone are superabundantly and richly fed:—for the sake of the offspring they must eat and drink and repose right royally; and their physiological specialization allows of such indulgence _ad libitum_.",
    "They seldom go out, and never unless attended by a powerful escort; as they cannot be permitted to incur unnecessary fatigue or danger.",
    "Probably they have no great desire to go out.",
    "Around them revolves the whole activity of the race: all its intelligence and toil and thrift are directed solely toward the well-being of these Mothers and of their children.",
    "But last and least of the race rank the husbands of these Mothers,—the necessary Evils,—the males.",
    "They appear only at a particular season, as I have already observed; and their lives are very short.",
    "Some cannot even boast of noble descent, though destined to royal wedlock; for they are not royal offspring, but virgin-born,—parthenogenetic children,—and, for that reason especially, inferior beings, the chance results of some mysterious atavism.",
    "But of any sort of males the commonwealth tolerates but few,—barely enough to serve as husbands for the Mothers-Elect, and these few perish almost as soon as their duty has been done.",
    "The meaning of Nature’s law, in this extraordinary world, is identical with Ruskin’s teaching that life without effort is crime; and since the males are useless as workers or fighters, their existence is of only momentary importance.",
    "They are not, indeed, sacrificed,—like the Aztec victim chosen for the festival of Tezcatlipoca, and allowed a honeymoon of twenty days before his heart was torn out.",
    "But they are scarcely less unfortunate in their high fortune.",
    "Imagine youths brought up in the knowledge that they are destined to become royal bridegrooms for a single night,—that after their bridal they will have no moral right to live,—that marriage, for each and all of them, will signify certain death,—and that they cannot even hope to be lamented by their young widows, who will survive them for a time of many generations...!",
    "V",
    "But all the foregoing is no more than a proem to the real “Romance of the Insect-World.”",
    "—By far the most startling discovery in relation to this astonishing civilization is that of the suppression of sex.",
    "In certain advanced forms of ant-life sex totally disappears in the majority of individuals;—in nearly all the higher ant-societies sex-life appears to exist only to the extent absolutely needed for the continuance of the species.",
    "But the biological fact in itself is much less startling than the ethical suggestion which it offers;—_for this practical suppression, or regulation, of sex-faculty appears to be voluntary!_",
    "Voluntary, at least, so far as the species is concerned.",
    "It is now believed that these wonderful creatures have learned how to develop, or to arrest the development, of sex in their young,—by some particular mode of nutrition.",
    "They have succeeded in placing under perfect control what is commonly supposed to be the most powerful and unmanageable of instincts.",
    "And this rigid restraint of sex-life to within the limits necessary to provide against extinction is but one (though the most amazing) of many vital economies effected by the race.",
    "Every capacity for egoistic pleasure—in the common meaning of the word “egoistic”—has been equally repressed through physiological modification.",
    "No indulgence of any natural appetite is possible except to that degree in which such indulgence can directly or indirectly benefit the species;—even the indispensable requirements of food and sleep being satisfied only to the exact extent necessary for the maintenance of healthy activity.",
    "The individual can exist, act, think, only for the communal good; and the commune triumphantly refuses, in so far as cosmic law permits, to let itself be ruled either by Love or Hunger.",
    "Most of us have been brought up in the belief that without some kind of religious creed—some hope of future reward or fear of future punishment—no civilization could exist.",
    "We have been taught to think that in the absence of laws based upon moral ideas, and in the absence of an effective police to enforce such laws, nearly everybody would seek only his or her personal advantage, to the disadvantage of everybody else.",
    "The strong would then destroy the weak; pity and sympathy would disappear; and the whole social fabric would fall to pieces...",
    "These teachings confess the existing imperfection of human nature; and they contain obvious truth.",
    "But those who first proclaimed that truth, thousands and thousands of years ago, never imagined a form of social existence in which selfishness would be _naturally_ impossible.",
    "It remained for irreligious Nature to furnish us with proof positive that there can exist a society in which the pleasure of active beneficence makes needless the idea of duty,—a society in which instinctive morality can dispense with ethical codes of every sort,—a society of which every member is born so absolutely unselfish, and so energetically good, that moral training could signify, even for its youngest, neither more nor less than waste of precious time.",
    "To the Evolutionist such facts necessarily suggest that the value of our moral idealism is but temporary; and that something better than virtue, better than kindness, better than self-denial,—in the present human meaning of those terms,—might, under certain conditions, eventually replace them.",
    "He finds himself obliged to face the question whether a world without moral notions might not be morally better than a world in which conduct is regulated by such notions.",
    "He must even ask himself whether the existence of religious commandments, moral laws, and ethical standards among ourselves does not prove us still in a very primitive stage of social evolution.",
    "And these questions naturally lead up to another: Will humanity ever be able, on this planet, to reach an ethical condition beyond all its ideals,—a condition in which everything that we now call evil will have been atrophied out of existence, and everything that we call virtue have been transmuted into instinct;—a state of altruism in which ethical concepts and codes will have become as useless as they would be, even now, in the societies of the higher ants.",
    "The giants of modern thought have given some attention to this question; and the greatest among them has answered it—partly in the affirmative.",
    "Herbert Spencer has expressed his belief that humanity will arrive at some state of civilization ethically comparable with that of the ant:— “If we have, in lower orders of creatures, cases in which the nature is constitutionally so modified that altruistic activities have become one with egoistic activities, there is an irresistible implication that a parallel identification will, under parallel conditions, take place among human beings.",
    "Social insects furnish us with instances completely to the point,—and instances showing us, indeed, to what a marvelous degree the life of the individual may be absorbed in subserving the lives of other individuals...",
    "Neither the ant nor the bee can be supposed to have a sense of duty, in the acceptation we give to that word; nor can it be supposed that it is continually undergoing self-sacrifice, in the ordinary acceptation of that word...",
    "[The facts] show us that it is within the possibilities of organization to produce a nature which shall be just as energetic in the pursuit of altruistic ends, as is in other cases shown in the pursuit of egoistic ends;—and they show that, in such cases, these altruistic ends are pursued in pursuing ends which, on their other face, are egoistic.",
    "For the satisfaction of the needs of the organization, these actions, conducive to the welfare of others, _must_ be carried on...",
    "“So far from its being true that there must go on, throughout all the future, a condition in which self-regard is to be continually subjected by the regard for others, it will, contrari-wise, be the case that a regard for others will eventually become so large a source of pleasure as to overgrow the pleasure which is derivable from direct egoistic gratification...",
    "Eventually, then, there will come also a state in which egoism and altruism are so conciliated that the one merges in the other.”",
    "VI Of course the foregoing prediction does not imply that human nature will ever undergo such physiological change as would be represented by structural specializations comparable to those by which the various castes of insect societies are differentiated.",
    "We are not bidden to imagine a future state of humanity in which the active majority would consist of semi-female workers and Amazons toiling for an inactive minority of selected Mothers.",
    "Even in his chapter, “Human Population in the Future,” Mr. Spencer has attempted no detailed statement of the physical modifications inevitable to the production of higher moral types,—though his general statement in regard to a perfected nervous system, and a great diminution of human fertility, suggests that such moral evolution would signify a very considerable amount of physical change.",
    "If it be legitimate to believe in a future humanity to which the pleasure of mutual beneficence will represent the whole joy of life, would it not also be legitimate to imagine other transformations, physical and moral, which the facts of insect-biology have proved to be within the range of evolutional possibility?...",
    "I do not know.",
    "I most worshipfully reverence Herbert Spencer as the greatest philosopher who has yet appeared in this world; and I should be very sorry to write down anything contrary to his teaching, in such wise that the reader could imagine it to have been inspired by Synthetic Philosophy.",
    "For the ensuing reflections, I alone am responsible; and if I err, let the sin be upon my own head.",
    "I suppose that the moral transformations predicted by Mr. Spencer, could be effected only with the aid of physiological change, and at a terrible cost.",
    "Those ethical conditions manifested by insect-societies can have been reached only through effort desperately sustained for millions of years against the most atrocious necessities.",
    "Necessities equally merciless may have to be met and mastered eventually by the human race.",
    "Mr. Spencer has shown that the time of the greatest possible human suffering is yet to come, and that it will be concomitant with the period of the greatest possible pressure of population.",
    "Among other results of that long stress, I understand that there will be a vast increase in human intelligence and sympathy; and that this increase of intelligence will be effected at the cost of human fertility.",
    "But this decline in reproductive power will not, we are told, be sufficient to assure the very highest of social conditions: it will only relieve that pressure of population which has been the main cause of human suffering.",
    "The state of perfect social equilibrium will be approached, but never quite reached, by mankind— _",
    "Unless there be discovered some means of solving economic problems, just as social insects have solved them, by the suppression of sex-life_.",
    "Supposing that such a discovery were made, and that the human race should decide to arrest the development of sex in the majority of its young,—so as to effect a transferrence of those forces, now demanded by sex-life to the development of higher activities,—might not the result be an eventual state of polymorphism, like that of ants?",
    "And, in such event, might not the Coming Race be indeed represented in its higher types,—through feminine rather than masculine evolution,—by a majority of beings of neither sex?",
    "Considering how many persons, even now, through merely unselfish (not to speak of religious) motives, sentence themselves to celibacy, it should not appear improbable that a more highly evolved humanity would cheerfully sacrifice a large proportion of its sex-life for the common weal, particularly in view of certain advantages to be gained.",
    "Not the least of such advantages—always supposing that mankind were able to control sex-life after the natural manner of the ants—would be a prodigious increase of longevity.",
    "The higher types of a humanity superior to sex might be able to realize the dream of life for a thousand years.",
    "Already we find lives too short for the work we have to do; and with the constantly accelerating progress of discovery, and the never-ceasing expansion of knowledge, we shall certainly find more and more reason to regret, as time goes on, the brevity of existence.",
    "That Science will ever discover the Elixir of the Alchemists’ hope is extremely unlikely.",
    "The Cosmic Powers will not allow us to cheat them.",
    "For every advantage which they yield us the full price must be paid: nothing for nothing is the everlasting law.",
    "Perhaps the price of long life will prove to be the price that the ants have paid for it.",
    "Perhaps, upon some elder planet, that price has already been paid, and the power to produce offspring restricted to a caste morphologically differentiated, in unimaginable ways, from the rest of the species...",
    "VII",
    "But while the facts of insect-biology suggest so much in regard to the future course of human evolution, do they not also suggest something of largest significance concerning the relation of ethics to cosmic law?",
    "Apparently, the highest evolution will not be permitted to creatures capable of what human moral experience has in all areas condemned.",
    "Apparently, the highest possible strength is the strength of unselfishness; and power supreme never will be accorded to cruelty or to lust.",
    "There may be no gods; but the forces that shape and dissolve all forms of being would seem to be much more exacting than gods.",
    "To prove a “dramatic tendency” in the ways of the stars is not possible; but the cosmic process seems nevertheless to affirm the worth of every human system of ethics fundamentally opposed to human egoism.",

    "[1] The Hour of the Rat (_Né-no-Koku_), according to the old Japanese method of reckoning time, was the first hour.",
    "It corresponded to the time between our midnight and two o’clock in the morning; for the ancient Japanese hours were each equal to two modern hours.",
    "[2] _Kaimyō_, the posthumous Buddhist name, or religious name, given to the dead.",
    "Strictly speaking, the meaning of the word is sila-name.",
    "(See my paper entitled, “The Literature of the Dead” in _Exotics and Retrospectives_.)",
    "YUKI-ONNA (1) An ancient province whose boundaries took in most of present-day Tōkyō, and parts of Saitama and Kanagawa prefectures.",

    "[1] The name signifies “Green Willow;”—though rarely met with, it is still in use.",
    "[2] The poem may be read in two ways; several of the phrases having a double meaning.",
    "But the art of its construction would need considerable space to explain, and could scarcely interest the Western reader.",
    "The meaning which Tomotada desired to convey might be thus expressed:—“While journeying to visit my mother, I met with a being lovely as a flower; and for the sake of that lovely person, I am passing the day here...",
    "Fair one, wherefore that dawn-like blush before the hour of dawn?—can it mean that you love me?”",
    "[3] Another reading is possible; but this one gives the signification of the _answer_ intended.",

    "The term “Kokuō” means the ruler of a country,—therefore a king.",
    "The original phrase, _Tokoyo no Kokuō_, might be rendered here as “the Ruler of Hōrai,” or “the King of Fairyland.”",

    "In this line the double value of the word _nympha_—used by classical poets both in the meaning of fountain and in that of the divinity of a fountain, or spring—reminds one of that graceful playing with words which Japanese poets practice.",

    "One must have seen the Japanese garment described, to appreciate the comparison.",

    "In taking off the haori, the brilliant lining is displayed,—and at such an instant the fluttering splendor might well be likened to the appearance of a butterfly in motion.",
    "[3] The bird-catcher’s pole is smeared with bird-lime; and the verses suggest that the insect is preventing the man from using his pole, by persistently getting in the way of it,—as the birds might take warning from seeing the butterfly limed. _",

    "[6] Literally, “a windless day;” but two negatives in Japanese poetry do not necessarily imply an affirmative, as in English.",
    "The meaning is, that although there is no wind, the fluttering motion of the butterflies suggests, to the eyes at least, that a strong breeze is playing.",
    "[7] Alluding to the Buddhist proverb: _Rakkwa éda ni kaërazu; ha-kyō futatabi terasazu_ (“The fallen flower returns not to the branch; the broken mirror never again reflects.”)",

    "No: it was only a butterfly.",
    "[8] Alluding probably to the light fluttering motion of falling cherry-petals.",

    "Oni mo jiu-hachi azami no hana:_",
    "“Even a devil at eighteen, flower-of-the-thistle.”",

    "[1] An interesting fact in this connection is that the Japanese word for ant, _ari_, is represented by an ideograph formed of the character for “insect” combined with the character signifying “moral rectitude,” “propriety” (_giri_).",

MACKENZIE With Illustrations in Colour & Monochrome after Paintings and Photographs THE GRESHAM PUBLISHING COMPANY LTD. 66",
    "CHANDOS ST. COVENT GARDEN LONDON PREFACE",
    "This volume deals with the myths of China and Japan, and it is shown that these throw light on the origin and growth of civilization and the widespread dissemination of complex ideas associated with certain modes of life.",
    "The Far East does not appear to have remained immune to outside cultural influences in ancient times.",
    "Modern research has established that the old school of opinions which insisted on the complete isolation of China can no longer obtain.",
    "As Laufer says: “It cannot be strongly enough emphasized on every occasion that Chinese civilization, as it appears now, is not a unit and not the exclusive production of the Chinese, but the final result of the cultural efforts of a vast conglomeration of the most varied tribes, an amalgamation of ideas accumulated from manifold quarters and widely differentiated in space and time....",
    "No graver error can hence be committed than to attribute any culture idea at the outset to the Chinese, for no other reason than because it appears within the precincts of their empire.”",
    "Even the Chinese records have to be regarded with caution.",
    "It is impossible nowadays to accept as serious contributions to history the inflated chronology and the obvious fables compiled and invented by Chinese scholars for political and other purposes during the Han and later dynasties.",
    "These scholars had really little knowledge of the early history of their country and people.",
    "They were puzzled even by certain existing customs and religious practices, and provided ingenious “secondary explanations” which, like their accounts of the early dynasties, do not accord with the data accumulated by archæologists and other workers in the scientific field.",
    "The complex religious ideas of the Chinese were obviously not of spontaneous generation.",
    "Many of these resemble too closely the complexes found elsewhere, and their history cannot be traced within the limits of the Chinese empire.",
    "Indeed, as is shown, some of them are undoubtedly products of human experiences obtained elsewhere, and they reveal traces of the influences to which they were subjected during the process of gradual transmission from areas of origin.",
    "Nor, would it appear, was Chinese civilization nearly as ancient as the native scholars would have us believe.",
    "When the early Chinese entered China, they found non-Chinese peoples in different parts of that vast area which they ultimately welded into an empire.",
    "They were an inland people and did not invent boats; they did not originate the agricultural mode of life but adopted it, using the seeds and implements they had acquired; nor did they invent the potter’s wheel with which they were familiar from the earliest times in China, having evidently become possessed of it, along with the complex culture associated with it, before they migrated into the province of Shensi.",
    "Nor could an agrarian people like the Chinese have been the originators of the belief in the existence of “Isles of the Blest” in the Eastern Ocean; they were not alone in Asia in believing in a Western Paradise situated among the mountains.",
    "The Chinese, as Laufer demonstrates in his Jade, did not pass through in China that culture stage called the “Neolithic”.",
    "When they first settled in Shensi, they searched for and found jade, as did the carriers of bronze who first entered Europe.",
    "There was obviously an acquired psychological motive for the search for jade, and the evidence of Chinese jade symbolism demonstrates to the full that it had been acquired from those who had transferred to jade the earlier symbolism of shells, pearls, and precious metals.",
    "In the chapter devoted to jade it is shown that this view is confirmed by the evidence afforded by Chinese customs connected with jade, shells, pearls, &c.",
    "In no country in the world are the processes of culture drifting and culture mixing made more manifest than in China.",
    "The Chinese dragon is, as Professor Elliot Smith puts it, a “composite wonder beast”.",
    "Throughout this volume it is shown to yield, when dissected, remarkable evidence regarding the varied influences under which it acquired its highly complex character.",
    "The fact that a Chinese dragon charm closely resembles a Scottish serpent charm is of special interest in this connection.",
    "When, however, it is found that China obtained certain myths and practices from the area called by its writers “Fu-lin” (the Byzantine Empire), and that not only Byzantine but Ægean influences are traceable in the Celtic field, the charm-link between Gaelic Scotland and China may not, after all, be regarded as “far-fetched”.",
    "The same may be said regarding the curious similarity between the myths and practices connected with shells, and especially cockle-shells, in Japan and the Scottish Hebrides.",
    "Although the West Highlanders and the inhabitants of the Land of the Rising Sun were never brought into contact, it may be that similar cultural influences drifted east and west from their area of origin, and that the carriers were the ancient mariners who introduced the same type of vessel into far-separated oceans.",
    "As in China, we do not in Japan find a culture of purely native origin, but rather one which has grown up from a mass of imported elements as varied as the racial types that compose the present-day population.",
    "Both in China and Japan these imported elements have been subjected to the influences of time and locality and infused with national ideas and ideals.",
    "The processes of growth and change have not, however, concealed the sources from which certain of the early ideas emanated in varying degrees of development.",
    "The early native history of Japan is, like that of China, no more worthy of acceptance than are the long-discarded English and Scottish fables regarding Brute and Scota.",
    "The data accumulated in this volume tend to show, although we have no direct evidence of systematic missionary enterprise earlier than that of the Buddhists, that the influential religious cults of ancient times that flourished in Mesopotamia and in the Egyptian Empire (which included part of Western Asia) appear to have left their impress on the intellectual life of even far-distant peoples.",
    "Apparently modes of thought were transmitted along direct and indirect avenues of intercourse by groups of traders.",
    "Even before trade routes were opened, religious beliefs and practices appear to have been introduced into distant lands by prospectors and by settlers who founded colonies from which later colonies “budded”.",
    "When the same set of complexes are found in widely separated areas, it is difficult to accept the view that they originated from the same particular experiences and the same set of circumstances, especially when it is made manifest that the complexes in the older centre of culture reflect strictly local physical conditions, and even the local political conditions that resulted in a fusion of peoples and of their myths, symbols, and religious beliefs and practices.",

    "The destinies of a people are shaped by their modes of thought, and their real history is therefore the history of their culture.",
    "The Chinese frame of mind has made the Chinese the people they are and China the country it is.",
    "Every section of society has been swayed by this far-reaching and enduring influence, the sources of which lie in remote antiquity.",
    "It is the force that has even been shaping public opinion and directing political movements.",
    "Emperors and leaders of thought have been uplifted by it or cast down by it.",
    "To understand China, it is necessary that we should inquire into its inner history—the history of its culture—so as to get at the Chinese point of view and look at things through Chinese eyes.",
    "That inner history is in part a record of its early experiences among the nations of the earth.",
    "There was a time when China was “in the making”, when the little leaven that leavened the whole lump began to move, when that culture which spread over a vast area was confined to a small centre and to a comparatively small group of people.",
    "Who were this people, where were they situated, what influences were at work to stir them and shape their ambitions, and what secret did they learn which gave them power over the minds and bodies of about a third of the inhabitants of the globe?",
    "In short, how and where did Chinese culture originate, and how did it spread and become firmly established?",
    "Was it a thing of purely local growth?",
    "Did it begin to be quite independently of all other cultures?",
    "Does it owe its virility and distinctiveness among the cultures of ancient and modern times to the influence of the locality in which it had “independent origin”?",
    "Had it an independent origin?",
    "These queries open up the larger problem as to the origin of civilization in the world.",
    "At this point, therefore, we must decide whether or not we are to accept the idea of evolution in human affairs.",
    "Can the principles of biological evolution be applied to the problems of ethnology (using the term in its widest sense to include the physical and cultural history of mankind)?",
    "Can we accept the theory that in isolated quarters of the globe separated communities were stirred by natural laws to make progress in adapting themselves to their environments, and that, once a beginning was made, separated communities developed on similar lines?",
    "Did each ancient civilization have its natural periods of growth and decay?",
    "Were separated communities uninfluenced during these periods by human minds and wills?",
    "Were their destinies shaped by natural laws, or by the cumulative force of public opinion?",
    "Was it a natural law that made men abandon the hunting and adopt the agricultural mode of life?",
    "Did certain communities of men, influenced by natural laws in ancient times, begin to shape their religious systems by first worshipping groups of spirits and ultimately, having passed through a sequence of well-defined stages, find themselves elevated by these natural laws to the stage of monotheism?",
    "Is it because certain races have, for some mysterious reason, been prompted to pass through these stages more quickly than others, that they are deserving of the term “progressive” while others must be characterized as “backward”?",
    "If these questions are answered in the affirmative, we must assume that we have solved the riddle of Mind.",
    "Those who apply the principles of biological evolution to human affairs are in the habit of referring to laws that control the workings of the human mind.",
    "But what do we really know about the workings of the human mind?",
    "This question has only to be asked so that the hazardous character of the fashion of thinking adopted by extreme exponents of the Evolution School may be emphasized.",
    "It cannot but be admitted that we know little or nothing regarding the human mind.",
    "What happens when we think?",
    "How are memories stored in the brain?",
    "How are emotions caused?",
    "What is Consciousness?",
    "How does the Will operate?",
    "Grave psychological problems have to be solved before we can undertake the responsibility of discussing with any degree of confidence the laws that are supposed to govern human thought and action.",
    "The researches into the early history of man, of about a generation ago, were believed by some to “have revealed the essential similarity with which, under many superficial differences, the human mind has elaborated its first crude philosophy of life”.",
    "It was found that similar beliefs and practices obtained among widely separated communities, and it was not suspected that the influence exercised by direct and indirect cultural contact between “progressive” and “backward” communities extended to such great distances as has since been found to be the case.",
    "Prospecting routes by land and sea were the avenues along which cultural influences “drifted”.",
    "Early man was much more enterprising as a trader and explorer than was believed in Tylor’s day.",
    "The evidence accumulated of late years tends to show that almost no part of the globe remained immune to the influences exercised by the great ancient civilizations, and that these civilizations were never in a state of “splendid isolation” at any period in their histories.",
    "In the light of this knowledge it is becoming more and more clear that Victorian ethnologists were inclined to make too much of resemblances, and failed to take into account the differences that a more intensive study of local cultures have revealed.",
    "There were, of course, resemblances, which suggest the influence of cultural contact and the settlement among backward peoples of colonists from progressive communities, but there were also differences of beliefs and customs which were of local origin and can hardly be characterized as “superficial”.",
    "One of the results of contact was the process of “culture mixing”.",
    "Customs and fashions of thinking were introduced into a country and blended with local customs and local modes of thought.",
    "In early China, as will be shown, there was “culture mixing”.",
    "The Chinese frame of mind is the result of compromises effected in remote times.",
    "How, then, did the idea of progress originate?",
    "Is there in the human mind an instinct which stirs mankind to achieve progress?",
    "If so, how does it come about that some peoples have failed to move until brought into contact with progressive races?",
    "Why did the Melanesians, for instance, remain in the Stone Age until reached by the missionary and the sandal-wood trader?",
    "The missionaries and the traders caused them to advance in a brief period from the Stone Age to the Age of Steel and Machinery.",
    "Can it be maintained that in ancient days no sudden changes took place?",
    "Did the people, for instance, who introduced bronze-working into a country introduce nothing else?",
    "Did they leave behind their beliefs, their myths, their customs, and their stories?",
    "When it is asked how progress originated, we can only turn to such evidence as is available regarding the early history of “Modern Man”.",
    "At a remote period, dating back in Europe to the Pleistocene Age, men lived in organized communities and pursued the hunting mode of life.",
    "Their culture is revealed by their pictorial art in the prehistoric cave-dwellings of France and Spain, and their decorative art by their finely engraved implements and weapons.",
    "[1] This art reached a high state of perfection.",
    "In some aspects it compares favourably with modern art.",
    "[2] Evidently it had a long history, and was practised by those who were endowed with the artistic faculty and had received a training.",
    "These early men, who belonged to the Cro-Magnon races, were traders as well as hunters.",
    "In some of their “inland stations” have been found shells that had been imported from the Mediterranean coast.",
    "The hunting mode of life prevailed also among the proto-Egyptians in the Nile valley, an area which was less capable in remote times of maintaining a large population than were the wide and fertile plains of Europe.",
    "Egypt was thinly peopled until the agricultural mode of life was introduced.",
    "Someone discovered how to make use of the barley that grew wild in the Nile valley and western Asia.",
    "In time the seeds were cultivated, and some little community thus provided itself with an abundant food-supply.",
    "Men’s minds were afterwards engaged in solving the problem how to extend the area available for cultivation in the narrow Nile valley.",
    "Nature was at hand to make suggestions to them.",
    "Each year the River Nile came down in flood and fertilized the parched and sun-burnt wastes.",
    "The waters caused the desert to “blossom like the rose”.",
    "Intelligent observers perceived that if the process of water-fertilization were maintained, as in the Delta region, they could extend their little farms and form new ones.",
    "The art of irrigation was discovered and gradually adopted, with the result that the narrow river valley, which had been thinly peopled during the Hunting Period, became capable of maintaining a large population.",
    "In what particular area the agricultural mode of life was first introduced, it is impossible to say.",
    "Some favour southern Palestine and some southern Mesopotamia.",
    "Those who favour Egypt [3] can refer to interesting and important evidence in support of their view.",
    "It is the only ancient country, for instance, in which there are traditions regarding the man [4] who introduced the agricultural mode of life.",
    "This was Osiris, a priest-king",
    "[5] who was deified, or a god to whom was credited the discovery, made by a man or group of men, of how to grow corn.",
    "Plutarch’s version of the Egyptian legend states: “Osiris, being now become King of Egypt, applied himself towards civilizing his countrymen, by turning them from their former indigent and barbarous course of life; he moreover taught them how to cultivate and improve the fruits of the earth”.",
    "Evidence has been forthcoming that the pre-Dynastic Egyptians were agriculturists.",
    "The bodies of many of them have been found preserved in their graves in the hot dry sands of Upper Egypt.",
    "“From the stomachs and intestines of these prehistoric people”, writes Professor G. Elliot Smith, “I was able to recover large quantities of food materials, in fact, the last meals eaten before death.”",
    "Careful examination was made of the contents of the stomachs.",
    "“Almost every sample contained husks of barley, and in about 10 per cent of the specimens husks of millet could be identified with certainty.”",
    "The millet found in these bodies is nearly related to the variety “which is now cultivated in the East Indies”.",
    "[6] Here we have proof that the agricultural mode of life obtained in the Nile valley over sixty centuries ago, and that the seeds of the cultivated variety of millet, which grows wild in North Africa and southern Asia, were carried to far-distant areas by ancient traders and colonists.",
    "These facts have, as will be found, an important bearing on the early history of Chinese civilization.",
    "Our immediate concern, however, is with the history of early civilization.",
    "In the Nile valley man made progress when he was able to provide something which he required, by the intelligent utilization of means at his disposal.",
    "No natural law prompted him to cultivate corn and irrigate the sun-parched soil.",
    "He did not become an agriculturist by instinct.",
    "He conducted observations, exercised his reasoning faculty, made experiments, and a great discovery was forthcoming.",
    "The man whose memory is enshrined in that of Osiris was one of the great benefactors of the human race.",
    "When he solved the problem of how to provide an abundant supply of food, he made it possible for a large population to live in a small area.",
    "It is told of Osiris that “he gave them (the Egyptians) a body of laws to regulate their conduct by”.",
    "No doubt the early hunters observed laws which regulated conduct in the cave-home as well as on the hunting-field.",
    "The fact that a great pictorial art was cultivated by Aurignacian man in western Europe, about 20,000 years ago, indicates that the social organization had been sufficiently well developed to permit of certain individuals of a class—possibly the priestly class—devoting themselves to the study of art, while others attended to the food-supply.",
    "Aurignacian art could never have reached the degree of excellence it did had there not been a school of art—apparently religious art—and a system of laws that promoted its welfare.",
    "When, in Egypt, the agricultural mode of life was introduced, and an abundant supply of food was assured, new laws became a necessity, so that the growing communities might be kept under control.",
    "These laws were given a religious significance.",
    "Osiris “instructed them (the Egyptians) in that reverence and worship which they were to pay to the gods”.",
    "Society was united by the bonds of a religious organization, and, as is found, Nilotic religion had a close association with the agricultural mode of life.",
    "It reflected the experiences of the early farmers; it reflected, too, the natural phenomena of the Nile valley.",
    "Water—the Nile water—was the fertilizing agency.",
    "It was the “water of life”.",
    "The god Osiris was closely associated with the Nile; he was the “fresh” or the “new” water that flowed in due season after the trying period of “the low Nile”, during which the land was parched by the burning sun and every green thing was coated by the sand-storms.",
    "“Ho, Osiris!",
    "the inundation comes,” cried the priest when the Nile began to rise.",
    "“Horus comes; he recognizes his father in thee, youthful in thy name of Fresh Water.”",
    "[7] The literal rendering is: “Horus comes; he beholds his father in thee, greenness in thy name of Water of Greenness”.",
    "The reference is to the “new water” which flows quite green for the first few days of the annual inundation.",
    "The “new water” entered the soil and vegetation sprang up.",
    "Osiris was the principle of life; he was also the ghost-god who controlled the river.",
    "As the Nile, Osiris was regarded as the source of all life—the creator and sustainer and ruler in one.",
    "When the discovery of how to grow corn was passed from people to people and from land to land, not only the seeds and agricultural implements were passed along, but the ceremonies and religious beliefs connected with the agricultural mode of life in the area of origin.",
    "The ceremonies were regarded as of as much importance as the implements.",
    "It need not surprise us, therefore, to find, as we do find, not only North African millet in the East Indies, but North African religious beliefs connected with agriculture in widely separated countries.",
    "Osirian religious ideas and myths were, it would appear, distributed over wide areas and among various races.",
    "There is therefore a germ of historical truth in the account given by Plutarch of the missionary efforts of Osiris.",
    "“With the same disposition”, we read, “he (Osiris) afterwards travelled over the rest of the world, inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline....",
    "The Greeks conclude him to have been the same person with their Dionysos or Bacchus.”",
    "[8] In the process of time the Egyptians found that they were able to produce a larger food-supply than they required for their own needs.",
    "They were consequently able to devote their surplus to stimulating trade, so as to obtain from other countries things which were not to be had in Egypt.",
    "They were thus brought into touch with other communities, and these communities, such as the wood-cutters of Lebanon, were influenced by Egyptian civilization and stimulated to adopt new modes of life.",
    "Their food-supply was assured by the Egyptian demand for timber.",
    "They received corn from the Nile valley in payment for their labour.",
    "There are references in the Egyptian texts to the exports of wheat to North Syria and Asia Minor.",
    "When the great discovery was made of how to work copper, the early agriculturists achieved rapid progress.",
    "Boats were built more easily and in larger numbers, new weapons were produced, and the Upper Egyptians conquered the Lower Egyptians, with the result that Egypt was united under a single king.",
    "With this union, which was followed by a period of remarkable activity, begins the history of Ancient Egypt.",
    "The man, remembered as Osiris, who first sowed his little corn patch, sowed also the seeds from which grew a mighty empire and a great civilization.",
    "His discovery spread from people to people, and from land to land, and a new era was inaugurated in the history of the world.",
    "Progress was made possible when mankind were led from the wide hunting-fields to the little fields of the Stone Age",
    "[9] farmer, and shown how they could live pleasant and well-ordered lives in large communities.",
    "The early Egyptian farmers found it necessary to measure time and take account of the seasons.",
    "A Calendar was introduced and adopted during the prehistoric (Palæolithic) period, [10] and was used by the Egyptians for thousands of years.",
    "Julius Cæsar adapted this Calendar for use in Rome.",
    "It was subsequently adjusted by Pope Gregory and others, and is now in use all over the civilized world.",
    "Each time we hang up a new calendar, therefore, we are reminded of the man who stimulated progress over vast areas by sowing corn, so as to provide food for his family in a distant land at a far-distant period of time.",
    "When we consider the problem of the origin of progress, let us not forget him and others like him—those early thinkers and discoverers to whom all humanity owe a debt of gratitude.",
    "The few invent, the many adopt; the few think and lead, and the many follow.",
    "“No abstract doctrine”, writes Sir James F. Frazer in this connection, “is more false and mischievous than that of the natural equality of men....",
    "The experience of common life sufficiently contradicts such a vain imagination....",
    "The men of keenest intelligence and strongest characters lead the rest and shape the moulds into which, outwardly at least, society is cast....",
    "The true rulers of men are the thinkers who advance knowledge....",
    "It is knowledge which, in the long run, directs and controls the forces of society.",
    "Thus the discoverers of new truths are the real though uncrowned and unsceptred kings of mankind.”",
    "[11] Progress has its origin in Mind.",
    "It has been manifested in the past in those districts in which the mind of man was applied to overcome natural obstacles and to develop natural resources.",
    "The histories of the great ancient civilizations do not support the idea of an evolutionary process which had its origin in human instinct.",
    "“There has”, Professor G. Elliot Smith writes, “been no general or widespread tendency on the part of human societies to strive after what by Europeans is regarded as intellectual or material progress.",
    "Progressive societies are rare because it requires a very complex series of factors to compel men to embark upon the hazardous process of striving after such artificial advancement.”",
    "Professor Elliot Smith will have none of what Dr. W. H. R. Rivers refers to as “crude evolutionary ideas”.",
    "“The history of man”, he writes, “will be truly interpreted, not by means of hazardous and mistaken analogies with biological evolution, but by the application of the true historical method.",
    "The causes of the modern actions of mankind are deeply rooted in the past.",
    "But the spirit of man has ever been the same: and the course of ancient history can only be properly appreciated when it is realized that the same human motives whose nature can be studied in our fellow-men to-day actuated the men of old also.”",
    "[12] In the chapters that immediately follow it will be shown that separated communities were brought into close touch by traders.",
    "The term “trading”, however, refers, especially in early times, chiefly to prospecting and the exploiting of locally unappreciated forms of wealth.",
    "It was not until after civilization had spread far and wide that permanent trade routes were established.",
    "Some overland routes became less important when sea routes were ultimately opened.",
    "CHAPTER II",
    "A FAR-TRAVELLED INVENTION The Potter’s Wheel—An Egyptian Invention—The Wheel in Theology—Clay Pots and Stone Vessels—Skilled Artisans produce Poor Pottery—The Yakut Evidence—Female Potters—Pot Symbol of Mother-goddess—Potter’s Wheel worked by Men—Egyptian “Wheel” adopted in Crete, Babylonia, Iran, India, and China—No “Wheel” in America—Secular and Religious Pottery in China, Japan, India, and Rome—Coarse Grave-Pottery—Potter’s Wheel as Symbol of Creator—Chinese Emperors as Potters—Culture Heroes—Association of Agriculture with Pottery—Egyptian Ideas in Far East.",
    "What bearing, it may be asked, have the discoveries made in Egypt on the early history of China?",
    "Is there evidence to show that these widely-separated countries were brought into contact in remote times?",
    "Did the primitive Chinese receive and adopt Egyptian inventions, and if so, how were such inventions conveyed across the wide and difficult country lying between the Mediterranean coast and the Yellow Sea?",
    "Is there any proof that trade routes extended in ancient times right across Asia?",
    "Did prospecting and trading ancient mariners cross the Indian Ocean and coast round to Chinese waters?",
    "Interesting evidence regarding cultural contact is afforded by the potter’s wheel.",
    "This wonderful machine was invented in Egypt some time before the Fourth Dynasty (about 3000 B.C.), and in its area of origin it exercised an influence not only on ceramic craftsmanship but on religious ideas.",
    "It was regarded as a gift of the gods, as in ancient Scotland bronze weapons, implements, musical instruments, &c., were regarded as gifts from the fairies.",
    "Apparently the invention was first introduced in Memphis, the ancient capital, the chief god of which was Ptah, the supreme deity “of all handicraftsmen and of all workers in metal and stone”.",
    "Ptah was already regarded as the creator of the primeval egg from which the universe was hatched, and of the “sun egg” and the “moon egg”.",
    "He was evidently a deity whose life-history goes back to primitive times when the mother-goddess was symbolized as the goose that laid the primeval egg.",
    "The problem of whether the egg or the bird came first was solved by the priests of the Ptah cult of Memphis, who regarded their deity as the creator of the “egg”.",
    "After the potter’s wheel came into use, they depicted Ptah turning the “egg” upon it.",
    "The manufacture of wheel-made pottery thus came to have religious associations.",
    "It was closely connected with the culture of Egypt which had its basis in the agricultural mode of life.",
    "The arts and crafts were all stimulated by religious ideas; they were cultivated by the priestly class in temple workshops, and were essentially an expression of Egyptian beliefs and conceptions.",
    "Before the potter’s wheel came into use, the potter’s art had degenerated.",
    "Vases, bowls, jars, platters, and other vessels were made of such costly stones as diorite, alabaster, and porphyry; these were drilled out with copper implements.",
    "Copper vessels were also made.",
    "The discovery of how to work copper had caused the craftsmen to neglect the potter’s art, and to work with enthusiasm in the hardest stone until they achieved a high degree of skill.",
    "The coarse pottery of the pre-wheel period is therefore no indication that the civilization had reached a stage of decadence.",
    "This fact should be a warning to those archæologists who are prone to conclude that if the pottery taken from a stratum in some particular area is “coarse”, the people who produced it at the period it represents were necessarily in a backward condition.",
    "The evidence afforded by Yakut products is of special interest in this connection.",
    "The Yakuts are usually referred to as “the most intelligent and progressive people in Siberia”.",
    "They are, however, poor potters.",
    "They never glaze their vessels or use the potter’s wheel.",
    "At the great Russian market of Yakutsk they refuse to purchase wheel-made crockery, and purchase instead the raw clay with which to make their own hand-made vessels, which are almost as coarse as those of the Stone Age.",
    "But although the technique displayed in their pottery is crude, they are famous for their excellent wood-carving and iron forged-work.",
    "[13] A people cannot, therefore, be judged by their pottery alone.",
    "It may be that those ancient peoples who are found to have been poor potters were skilled and progressive in other spheres of activity.",
    "The Hebrews were poor artisans and never invented anything, but they have given the world a great religious literature.",
    "After the potter’s wheel was introduced in Memphis, a new era in the history of pottery was inaugurated.",
    "The enclosed baking-furnace came into use at the same time, and the potter’s art and technique speedily attained a wonderfully high degree of excellence.",
    "But the old crude, hand-made pottery was still being produced.",
    "It was consistently produced until Egypt ceased to be a great and independent kingdom.",
    "Indeed, it is being manufactured even in our own day.",
    "The reason why good and bad pottery are produced in a single country—and Egypt is no exception to this rule—is that the manufacture of hand-made vessels was in ancient times essentially a woman’s avocation.",
    "The potter’s wheel was invented by man, and credited to a god, and has from the beginning been worked by men only.",
    "There was apparently a religious significance in the connection of the sexes with the different processes.",
    "The clay pot was, in ancient Egypt, a symbol of the mother-goddess.",
    "[14] Pots used in connection with the worship of the Great Mother were apparently produced by her priestesses.",
    "As women played their part in agricultural ceremonies, so did they play their part—evidently a prominent one—in producing the goddess’s pot symbols.",
    "The coarse jars in which were stored wines and oils and food-stuffs were gifts of the Great Mother, the giver of all; she was the inexhaustible sacred Pot—the womb of Nature.",
    "Domestic pottery used by women was, very properly, the ancient folks appear to have argued, produced by women.",
    "“It will be noted”, writes O. T. Mason in this connection, “that the feminine gender is used throughout in speaking of aboriginal potters.",
    "This is because every piece of such ware is the work of woman’s hands.",
    "She quarried the clay, and, like the patient beast of burden, bore it home on her back.",
    "She washed it and kneaded it and rolled it into fillets.",
    "These she wound carefully and symmetrically until the vessel was built up.",
    "She further decorated and burned it, and wore it out in household drudgery.",
    "The art at first was woman’s.”",
    "[15] In many countries the connection of women with hand-made and of men with wheel-made pottery obtains even in our day.",
    "The following statement by two American scholars, who have produced a short but authoritative paper on the potter’s art, is the result of a close investigation of evidence collected over a wide area, and carefully digested and summarized:",
    "[16] “The potter’s wheel is the creation of man, and therefore is an independent act of invention which was not evolved from any contrivance utilized during the period of hand-made ceramic ware.",
    "The two processes have grown out of two radically distinct spheres of human activity.",
    "The wheel, so speak, came from another world.",
    "It had no point of contact with any tool that existed in the old industry, but was brought in from an outside quarter as a novel affair when man appropriated to himself the work hitherto cultivated by woman.",
    "The development was one from outside, not from within.",
    "All efforts, accordingly, which view the subject solely from the technological angle, and try to derive the wheel from previous devices of the female potter, are futile and misleading.",
    "It is as erroneous as tracing the plough back to the hoe or digging-stick, whereas, in fact, the two are in no historical interrelation and belong to fundamentally different culture strata and periods—the hoe to the gardening activity of woman, the plough to the agricultural activity of man.",
    "Both in India and China the division of ceramic labour sets apart the thrower or wheel-potter, and distinctly separates him from the moulder.",
    "The potters in India, who work on the wheel, do not intermarry with those who use a mould or make images.",
    "They form a caste by themselves.”",
    "[17] The oldest wheel-made pottery is found in Egypt.",
    "There can be no doubt that the potter’s wheel was invented in that country.",
    "It was imported into Crete, which had trading relations with the merchants of the ancient Pharaohs, as far back as about 3000 B.C. Before the wheel was adopted the Cretans made stone vessels, following Egyptian patterns, but using soft stone instead of hard.",
    "Their hand-made pottery degenerated, as did the Egyptian.",
    "“Pottery came again to its own in both countries”, writes Mr. H. R. Hall, “with the invention of the potter’s wheel and the baking-furnace.”",
    "[18] The potter’s wheel must have found a ready market in the old days.",
    "It was adopted, in time, in western Europe; it was quickly “taken up” in Babylonia and in Iran, and was ultimately introduced into India and China.",
    "But only the high Asiatic civilizations were capable of constructing it, and consequently wheel-made pottery is not found everywhere.",
    "Among the “aboriginal Americans” the wheel was never employed.",
    "It is an interesting fact that the mind of man, which is alleged to “work” on the same lines everywhere, never “evolved” a potter’s wheel in Mexico or Peru.",
    "[19] Major Gordon tells that in Assam [20] “the women fashion the pots by hand; they do not use the potter’s wheel”.",
    "Similar evidence is obtainable in various other countries.",
    "In China there are wheel-potters and moulders, and a distinction is drawn between them by ancient writers.",
    "“This clear distinction is accentuated by Chu Yen in his treatise on pottery.",
    "[21] He justly observes also that the articles made by the wheel-potters were all intended for cooking, with the exception of the vessel yu, which was designed for measuring; while the output of the moulders, who made the ceremonial vessels kuei and tou by availing themselves of the plumb-line, was intended for sacrificial use.",
    "Also here, in like manner as in ancient Rome, India, and Japan, the idea may have prevailed that a wheel-made jar is of a less sacred character than one made by hand.”",
    "[22] Here then we touch on another point which must be borne in mind by those who draw conclusions regarding ancient cultures by means of pottery.",
    "In Britain, for instance, a rather coarse pottery is found in graves.",
    "It is possible that a better pottery was made for everyday use.",
    "The conservatism of burial customs may have caused coarser pottery to be put into graves than the early folks were capable of producing during the period at which the burial took place.",
    "The wheel-pottery was as sacred to some cults as the hand-made was to others.",
    "Even the potter’s wheel was sacred.",
    "In Egypt the Ptah cult adopted it, as has been stated; in India it was a symbol of the Creator; in China (as in ancient Egypt)",
    "the idea originally prevailed that the Creator was a potter who turned on his wheel the sun and the moon, man and woman, although in time this myth became a philosophical abstraction.",
    "The symbolism of Jeremiah has similarly a history: “O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter?",
    "saith the Lord.",
    "Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.”—Chapter",
    "XVIII, 6. St. Paul, too, refers to the potter: “Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?",
    "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?",
    "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?”",
    "(Romans, ix, 20–21.)",
    "Chinese emperors were compared to potters.",
    "They were credited with the power to control a nation as the potter controlled his wheel.",
    "The ancient peoples who adopted the Egyptian potter’s wheel evidently learned that it was of divine origin.",
    "They adopted the Egyptian beliefs and myths associated with it.",
    "Withal, the wheel was associated with the agricultural mode of life, having originated in a country of agriculturists.",
    "Ptah, the divine potter, was, like all the other prominent gods of Egypt, fused with Osiris—the god who was, among other things, the “culture hero”.",
    "The Chinese “culture hero”, Shun, who became emperor, is said to have “practised husbandry, fishing, and making pottery jars”.",
    "He manufactured clay vessels without flaw on the river bank.",
    "[23] The Chinese culture hero, Shen-ming (“Divine Husbandman”) “was regarded as the father of agriculture and the discoverer of the healing property of plants”.",
    "In ancient Chinese lore “we meet a close association of agriculture with pottery, and an illustration of the fact that husbandman and potter were one and the same person during the primeval period”.",
    "[24] Memories of Ptah-Osiris clung to the potter’s wheel.",
    "The trade routes must have hummed with stories about the god who had gifted this wonderful contrivance to mankind.",
    "These stories were localized in various countries, and they took on the colour of the period during which the wheel was imported.",
    "In Japan, the Ptah legend has been given a Buddhistic significance.",
    "The potter’s wheel is reputed there to be the invention of the famous Korean monk, Gyõgi (A.D. 670–749).",
    "No doubt the first potter’s wheel reached Japan from Korea, whence came the conquerors of the Ainus.",
    "But there is evidence that it was in use long before Buddhism “drifted” along the sea route from the mainland in the sixth century, to become curiously mixed up with Shintoism two centuries later.",
    "The priests of Buddhism, who transformed the Shinto gods into “avatars” of Buddha, no doubt also identified the far-carried Ptah-Osiris with their monk—the Japanese “culture hero”.",
    "The earliest pottery in Japan was manufactured by the Ainus and was “hand-shaped” by the women.",
    "A similar pottery was produced in Korea.",
    "The wheel-made variety made its appearance when Chinese culture spread through Korea during the Silla kingdom period, which began about the time (A.D. 59) when the earliest Japanese, according to their own traditions, migrated to the islands that bear their name.",
    "No doubt the traders were active on sea and land long before the Japanese conquered the islands of the Ainus and the Chinese overran Korea.",
    "Great migrations and conquests in ancient times were indirectly stimulated by trade.",
    "A new culture was introduced into backward communities by the early prospectors and trading colonists, and these communities in time acquired weapons, reared the domesticated horse, and took to the sea after having learned how to build and navigate ships similar to those introduced by the traders.",
    "When the potter’s wheel was introduced into Korea, the clay vessels were shaped in imitation of Chinese pottery.",
    "There can remain no doubt, therefore, as to whence the wheel came.",
    "China was the chief centre of early civilization in the Far East, and its influence spread far and wide.",
    "There are some who think that Burma was during its early period in closer touch with China than with India; but more evidence than is yet available is required to establish this theory.",
    "The earliest civilization in southern China of which we have knowledge was of Indian origin.",
    "The sea traders who had crossed the Indian Ocean reached the Burmese coast several centuries before the Christian era, as the archaic character of Burmese river boats suggests.",
    "It may be, however, that the potter’s wheel was carried along the mid-Asian trade routes long before the shippers coasted round to Chinese waters.",
    "There can be no doubt that the potter’s wheel was introduced into China at a very remote period.",
    "Investigators are unable to discover any native legends regarding its origin.",
    "Nor are there any traditions regarding female potters.",
    "The culture heroes of China who made the first pots appear to have used the wheel, and the Chinese potter’s wheel is identical with the Egyptian.",
    "When the wheel was introduced into Japan, hand-made pottery was in use for religious purposes, and for long afterwards the vessels used at Shinto shrines were not turned on the wheel.",
    "In India, hand-made pottery was similarly reserved for religious worship after the wheel-made variety came into use.",
    "[25] The wheel did not reach southern India until its Iron Age.",
    "[26] When the southern India Iron Age began is uncertain.",
    "It was not, of course, an “Age” in the real sense, but a cultural “stage”.",
    "Iron was known and apparently in use during the Aryo-Indian Vedic period in the north.",
    "[27] The potter’s wheel was introduced into Babylonia at a very remote period.",
    "From Babylonia it was carried into Persia.",
    "The Avestan word for kiln is tanura, which is believed, according to Laufer, to be a loan word from Semitic tanur.",
    "There are, of course, no records regarding the introduction of the potter’s wheel into Babylonia, India, or China.",
    "All that we know definitely is that it first came into use in Egypt, and that it was afterwards adopted in the various ancient centres of civilization from which cultural influences “flowed” to various areas.",
    "With the wheel went certain religious ideas and customs.",
    "These are not found in the areas unreached by the potter’s wheel.",
    "China appears to have been influenced at the dawn of its history by the culture represented by the Egyptian wheel.",

    "Further important evidence regarding cultural contact in early times is afforded by shipping.",
    "How came it about that an inland people like the primitive Chinese took to seafaring?",
    "The question that first arises in this connection is: Were ships invented and developed by a single ancient people, or were they invented independently by various ancient peoples at different periods?",
    "Were the Chinese junks of independent origin?",
    "Or were these junks developed from early models of vessels—such foreign vessels as first cruised in Chinese waters?",
    "Chinese junks are flat-bottomed ships, and the largest of them reach about 1000 tons.",
    "The poops and fore-castles are high, and the masts carry lug-sails, generally of bamboo splits.",
    "They are fitted with rudders.",
    "Often on the bows appear painted or inlaid eyes.",
    "These eyes are found on models of ancient Egyptian ships.",
    "During the first Han dynasty (about 206 B.C.) junks of “one thousand kin” (about 15 tons) were regarded as very large vessels.",
    "In these boats the early Chinese navigators appear to have reached Korea and Japan.",
    "But long before they took to the sea there were other mariners in the China sea.",
    "The Chinese were, as stated, originally an inland people.",
    "They were acquainted with river kufas (coracles) before they reached the seashore.",
    "These resembled the kufas of the Babylonians referred to by Herodotus, who wrote: “The boats which come down the river to Babylon are circular, and made of skins.",
    "The frames, which are of willow, are cut in the country of the Armenians above Assyria, and on these, which serve for hulls, a covering of skins is stretched outside, and thus the boats are made, without either stem or stern, quite round like a shield.”",
    "[28] These kufas are still in use in Mesopotamia.",
    "They do not seem to have altered much since the days of Hammurabi, or even of Sargon of Akkad.",
    "The Assyrians crossed rivers on skin floats, and some of the primitive peoples of mid-Asia are still using the inflated skins of cows as river “ferry-boats”.",
    "But such contrivances hardly enter into the history of shipping.",
    "The modern liner did not “evolve” from either kufa or skin float.",
    "Logs of wood were, no doubt, used to cross rivers at an early period.",
    "The idea of utilizing these may have been suggested to ancient hunters who saw animals being carried down on trees during a river flood.",
    "But attempts to utilize a tree for crossing a river would have been disastrous when first made, if the hunters were unable to swim.",
    "Trees are so apt to roll round in water.",
    "Besides, they would be useless if not guided with a punting-pole, expertly manipulated.",
    "Early man must have learned how to navigate a river by using, to begin with, at least two trees lashed together.",
    "In Egypt and Babylonia we find traces of his first attempts in this connection.",
    "The reed float, consisting of two bundles of reeds, and the raft to which the inflated skins of animals were attached to give it buoyancy, were in use at an early period on the Rivers Nile and Euphrates.",
    "A raft of this kind had evidently its origin among a people accustomed, as were the later Assyrians, to use skin floats when swimming across rivers.",
    "There are sculptured representations of the Assyrian soldiers swimming with inflated skins under their chests.",
    "The reed float was in use at a very early period on the Nile.",
    "Professor Breasted says that the two prehistoric floats were “bound firmly together, side by side, like two huge cigars”, and adds the following interesting note: “The writer was once without a boat in Nubia, and a native from a neighbouring village at once hurried away and returned with a pair of such floats made of dried reeds from the Nile shores.",
    "On this somewhat precarious craft he ferried the writer over a wide channel to an island in the river.",
    "It was the first time that the author had ever seen this contrivance, and it was not a little interesting to find a craft which he knew only in the Pyramid texts of 5000 years ago still surviving and in daily use on the ancient river in far-off Nubia.”",
    "In the Pyramid texts there are references to the reed floats used by the souls of kings when being ferried across the river to death.",
    "The gods “bind together the two floats for this King Pepi”, runs a Pyramid text.",
    "“The knots are tied, the ferry-boats are brought together”, says another, and there are allusions to the ferryman (the prehistoric Charon) standing in the stern and poling the float.",
    "Before the Egyptian sun-god was placed in a boat, he had “two floats of the sky” to carry him along the celestial Nile to the horizon.",
    "[29] The “dug-out” canoe was probably developed from the raft.",
    "Men who drifted timber down a river may have had the idea of a “dug-out” suggested to them by first shaping a seat on a log, or a “hold” to secure the food-supply for the river voyage.",
    "Pitt Rivers suggests that after the discovery was made that a hollowed log could be utilized in water, “the next stage in the development of the canoe would consist in pointing the ends”.",
    "[30] In what locality the dug-out canoe was invented it is impossible to say with absolute certainty.",
    "All reliable writers on naval architecture agree, however, that Egypt was the “cradle” of naval architecture.",
    "[31] “For the development of the art of shipbuilding,” says Chatterton, “few countries could be found as suitable as Egypt....",
    "The peacefulness of the waters of the Nile, the absence of storms, and the rarity of calms, combined with the fact that, at any rate, during the winter and early spring months, the gentle north wind blew up the river with the regularity of a Trade Wind, so enabling the ships to sail against the stream without the aid of oars—these were just the conditions that many another nation might have longed for.",
    "Very different, indeed, were the circumstances which had to be wrestled with in the case of the first shipbuilders and sailormen of Northern Europe.”",
    "[32] The early Egyptians were continually crossing the river.",
    "When they began to convey stones from their quarries, they required substantial rafts.",
    "Egyptian needs promoted the development of the art of navigation on a river specially suited for experiments that led to great discoveries.",
    "The demand for wood was always great, and it was intensified after metal-working had been introduced, because of the increased quantities of fuel required to feed the furnaces.",
    "It became absolutely necessary for the Egyptians to go far afield in search of timber.",
    "The fact that they received supplies of timber at an early period from Lebanon is therefore of special interest.",
    "Their experiences in drifting rafts of timber across the Mediterranean from the Syrian coast apparently not only stimulated naval architecture and increased the experiences of early navigators, but inaugurated the habit of organizing seafaring expeditions on a growing scale.",
    "“Men”, says Professor Elliot Smith, “did not take to maritime trafficking either for aimless pleasure or for idle adventure.",
    "They went to sea only under the pressure of the strongest incentives.”",
    "[33] The Mediterranean must have been crossed at a very early period.",
    "Settlements of seafarers took place in Crete before 3000 B.C.",
    "[34] On the island have been found flakes of obsidian that were imported at the dawn of its history from the Island of Melos.",
    "No doubt obsidian artifacts were used in connection with the construction of vessels before copper implements became common.",
    "The earliest evidence of shipbuilding as an organized and important national industry is found in the Egyptian tomb pictures of the Old Kingdom period (c. 2400 B.C.).",
    "Gangs of men, under overseers, are seen constructing many kinds of boats, large and small.",
    "There are records of organized expeditions dating back 500 years earlier.",
    "Pharaoh Snefru built vessels “nearly one hundred and seventy feet long”.",
    "He sent “a fleet of forty vessels to the Phœnician coast to procure cedar logs from the slopes of Lebanon”.",
    "[35] Expeditions were also sent across the Red Sea.",
    "Vessels with numerous oars, and even vessels with sails, are depicted on Egyptian prehistoric pottery dating back to anything like 6000 B.C.",
    "In no other country in the world was seafaring and shipbuilding practised at such a remote period.",
    "The earliest representations of deep-sea boats are found in Egypt.",
    "One is seen in the tomb of Sahure, of the Fifth Dynasty (c. 2600 B.C.).",
    "A great expedition sailed to Punt (Somaliland) during the reign of Queen Halshepsut (c. 1500 B.C.).",
    "Five of the highly-developed vessels are depicted in her temple at Deir-el-Bahari.",
    "It is of interest to compare one of these vessels with a Chinese junk.",
    "“Between the Chinese and Burmese junks of to-day and the Egyptian ships of about six thousand years ago there are”, writes E. Kebel Chatterton, “many points of similarity....",
    "Until quite recently, China remained in the same state of development for four thousand years.",
    "If that was so with her arts and life generally, it has been especially so in the case of her sailing craft.”",
    "Both the Chinese junk and the ancient Egyptian ship “show a common influence and a remarkable persistence in type”.",
    "[36] “Are we to believe”, a reader asks, “that the ancient Egyptian navigators went as far as China?",
    "Is there any proof that they made long voyages?",
    "Were the ancient Egyptians not a people who lived in isolation for a prolonged period?”",
    "[37] It is not known definitely how far the ancient Egyptian mariners went after they had begun to venture to sea.",
    "But one thing is certain.",
    "They made much longer voyages than were credited to them a generation ago.",
    "The Phœnicians, who became the sea-traders of the Egyptians, learned the art of navigation from those Nilotic adventurers who began to visit their coast at a very early period in quest of timber; they adopted the Egyptian style of craft, as did the Cretans, their predecessors in Mediterranean sea trafficking.",
    "By the time of King Solomon the Phœnicians had established colonies in Spain, and were trading not only from Carthage in the Mediterranean, but apparently with the British Isles, while they were also active in the Indian Ocean.",
    "They were evidently accustomed to make long voyages of exploration.",
    "At the time of the Jewish captivity, Pharaoh Necho (609–593 B.C.) sent an expedition of Phœnicians from the Red Sea to circumnavigate Africa.",
    "They returned three years later by way of Gibraltar.",
    "But their voyage excited no surprise in Egypt.",
    "[38] It had long been believed by the priests that the world was surrounded by water.",
    "Besides, these priests preserved many traditions of long voyages that had been made to distant lands.",
    "There are those who believe that the early Egyptian mariners, who were accustomed to visit British East Africa and sail round the Arabian coast, founded the earliest colony in Sumeria (ancient Babylonia) at the head of the Persian Gulf.",
    "The cradle of Sumerian culture was Eridu, “the sea port”.",
    "The god of Eridu was Ea, who had a ship with pilot and crew.",
    "According to Babylonian traditions, he instructed the people, as did Osiris in Egypt, how to irrigate the land, grow corn, build houses and temples, make laws, engage in trade, and so on.",
    "He was remembered as a monster—a goat-fish god, or half fish, half man.",
    "Apparently he was identical with the Oannes of Berosus.",
    "It may be that Ea-Oannes symbolized the seafarers who visited the coast and founded a colony at Eridu, introducing the agricultural mode of life and the working of copper.",
    "Early inland peoples must have regarded the mariners with whom they first came into contact as semi-divine beings, just as the Cubans regarded Columbus and his followers as visitors from the sky.",
    "The Mongols of Tartary entertained quaint ideas about the British “foreign devils” after they had fought in one of the early wars against China.",
    "M. Huc, the French missionary priest of the congregation of St. Lazarus, who travelled through Tartary, Tibet, and China during 1844–6, had once an interesting conversation with a Mongol, who “had been told by the Chinese what kind of people, or monsters rather, these English were”.",
    "The story ran that the Englishmen “lived in the water like fish, and when you least expected it, they would rise to the surface and cast at you fiery gourds.",
    "Then as soon as you bend your bow to send an arrow at them, they plunge again into the water like frogs.”",
    "[39] Those who suppose that the Sumerians coasted round from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea, landed on the barren African coast, and, setting out to cross a terrible desert, penetrated to the Nile valley along a hitherto unexplored route of about 200 miles, have to explain what was the particular attraction offered to them by prehistoric Egypt if, according to their theory, it was still uncultivated and in the “Hunting Age”.",
    "How came it about that they knew of a river which ran through desert country?",
    "It is more probable that the Nilotic people penetrated to the Red Sea coast, and afterwards ventured to sea in their river boats, and that, in time, having obtained skill in navigation, they coasted round to the Persian Gulf.",
    "In pre-Dynastic times the Egyptians obtained shells from the Red Sea coast.",
    "At what period India was first reached is uncertain.",
    "When Solomon imported peacocks from that country (the land of the peacock), the sea route was already well known.",
    "It is significant to find that all round the coast, from the Red Sea to India, Ceylon, and Burma, the Egyptian types of vessels have been in use from the earliest seafaring periods.",
    "The Burmese junks on the Irawadi resemble closely, as has been indicated, the Nile boats of the ancient Egyptians.",
    "[40] The Chinese junks were developed from Egyptian models.",
    "More antique Egyptian boats than are found on the Chinese coast are still being used by the Koryak tribe who dwell around the sea of Okhotsk.",
    "Mr. Chatterton says that the Koryak craft have “important similarities to the Egyptian ships of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties (c. 3000–2500 B.C.).",
    "Thus, besides copying the ancients in steering with an oar, the fore-end of the prow of their sailing boats terminates in a fork through which the harpoon-line is passed, the fork being sometimes carved with a human face which they believe will serve as a protector of the boat.",
    "Instead of rowlocks they have, like the early Egyptians, thong-loops through which the oar or paddle is inserted.",
    "Their sail, too, is a rectangular shape of dressed reindeer skins sewed together.",
    "But it is their mast that is especially like the Egyptians and Burmese.”",
    "This mast is made of three poles “set up in the manner of a tripod”.",
    "The double mast was common in ancient Egypt, but Mr. Chatterton notes that Mr. Villiers Stuart “found on the walls of a tomb belonging to the Sixth Dynasty (c. 2400 B.C.) at Gebel Abu Faida, the painting of a boat with a treble mast made of three spars arranged like the edges of a triangular pyramid”.",
    "[41] Thus we find that vessels of Egyptian type (adopted by various peoples) not only reached China but went a considerable distance beyond it.",
    "Japanese vessels still display Egyptian characteristics.",
    "In the Moluccas and Malays the ancient three-limbed mast has not yet gone out of fashion.",
    "Polynesian craft were likewise developed from Egyptian models.",
    "William Ellis, the missionary, [42] noted “the peculiar and almost classical shape of the large Tahitian canoes”, with “elevated prow and stern”, and tells that a fleet of them reminded him of representations of “the ships in which the Argonauts sailed, or the vessels that conveyed the heroes of Homer to the siege of Troy”.",
    "Various writers have called attention to the persistence of Egyptian types in the Mediterranean and in northern Europe.",
    "“In every age and every district of the ancient world”, wrote Mr. Cecil Torr, the great authority on classic shipping, “the method of rigging ships was substantially the same; and this method is first depicted by the Egyptians.”",
    "[43] The Far Eastern craft went long distances in ancient days.",
    "Ellis tells of regular voyages made by Polynesian chiefs which extended to 300 and even 600 miles.",
    "A chief from Rurutu once visited the Society Islands in a native boat built “somewhat in the shape of a crescent, the stem and stern high and pointed and the sides deep”.",
    "[44] Sometimes exceptionally long voyages were forced by the weather conditions of Oceania.",
    "“In 1696”, Ellis writes, “two canoes were driven from Ancarso to one of the Philippine Islands, a distance of 800 miles.”",
    "He gives other instances of voyages of like character.",
    "A Christian missionary, travelling in a native boat, was carried “nearly 800 miles in a south-westerly direction”.",
    "[45] Reference has already been made to the long and daring voyage made by the Phœnicians who circumnavigated Africa.",
    "Another extraordinary enterprise is referred to by Pliny the elder, [46] who quotes from the lost work of Cornelius Nepos.",
    "This was a voyage performed by Indians who had, before 60 B.C., embarked on a commercial voyage and reached the coast of Germany.",
    "It is uncertain whether they sailed round the Cape of Good Hope and up the Atlantic Ocean, or went northward past Japan and discovered the north-east passage, skirting the coast of Siberia, and sailing round Lapland and Norway to the Baltic.",

    "There can be no doubt as to the reasons why Solomon sought to emulate the maritime activities of the Phœnicians who had been bringing peacocks from India, silver from Spain, and gold from West Africa and elsewhere long before his day.",
    "“And King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.",

    "[49] About seven centuries before Solomon’s day, Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt, to whom reference was made in the last chapter, had emulated the feats of her ancestors by sending a fleet to Punt (Somaliland or British East Africa) to bring back, among other things, myrrh trees for her new temple.",
    "The myrrh was required “for the incense in the temple service”.",
    "[50] Ancient mariners set out on long voyages, not only on the quest of wealth, but also of various articles required for religious purposes.",
    "Indeed, the quest of wealth had originally religious associations.",
    "Gold, silver, copper, pearls, and precious stones were all sacred, and it was because of their connection with the ancient deities that they were first sought for.",
    "The so-called “ornaments” worn by our remote ancestors were charms against evil and ill luck.",
    "Metals were similarly supposed to have protective qualities.",
    "Iron is still regarded in the Scottish Highlands as a charm against fairy attack.",
    "In China it is a protection against dragons.",
    "The souls of the Egyptian dead were “charmed” in the other world by the amulets placed in their tombs.",
    "When the Pharaoh’s soul entered the boat of the sun-god he was protected by metals.",

    "In Greece and India the mythical ages were associated with metals, and iron was the metal of the dark age of evil (the Indian “Kali Yuga”).",
    "In China the metals have similarly religious associations.",
    "The dragon-gods of water, rain, and thunder are connected with gold of various hues—the “golds” coloured by the alchemists by fusion with other metals.",
    "Thus we have Chinese references to red, yellow, white, blue, and black gold, as in the following extract: “When the yellow dragon, born from yellow gold a thousand years old, enters a deep place, a yellow spring dashes forth; and if from this spring some particles (fine dust) arise, these become a yellow cloud.",
    "“In the same way blue springs and blue clouds originate from blue dragons, born from blue gold eight hundred years old; red, white, and black springs and clouds from red, white, and black dragons born from gold of same colours a thousand years old.”",

    "Mountain and sanctuary were consequently given dragon names.",
    "The “jewel that grants all desires” is known in India, China, and Japan.",
    "A Japanese story relates that once upon a time an Indian Buddhist abbot, named Bussei (Buddha’s vow), set out on a voyage with purpose to obtain this jewel (a pearl) which was possessed by “the dragon king of the ocean”.",
    "In the midst of the sea the boat hove to while Bussei performed a ceremony and repeated a charm, causing the dragon-king to appear.",
    "The abbot, making a mystic sign, then demanded the pearl; but the dragon deceived him and nullified the mystic sign.",
    "Rising in the air, “the King of the Ocean” caused a great storm to rage.",

    "Bussei afterwards migrated from southern India to Japan, accompanied by Baramon (“Wall-gazing Brahman”).",

    "During her reign a great fleet went to Korea to obtain tribute.",
    "The Korean fleet went out to meet it, but when it was drawn up for battle, a Japanese god cast into the sea the “Pearl of Ebb”, and immediately the waters withdrew, leaving both fleets stranded.",
    "The resolute King of Korea, not to be daunted, leapt on to the dried sea-bed, and, marshalling his troops there, advanced at the head of them to attack and destroy the Japanese fleet.",
    "Then the Japanese god flung the “Pearl of Flood” into the sea.",
    "No sooner was this done than the waters returned and drowned large numbers of Koreans.",
    "Then a tidal wave swept over the Korean shore, while the troops prayed for their lives in vain.",
    "Not until the “Pearl of Ebb” was thrown once again into the sea did the waters retreat from the land.",
    "After these miraculous and disastrous manifestations, the King of Korea was glad to make peace, and sent out three vessels laden with tribute to the empress, who had conquered the enemy without the loss of a single Japanese soldier or sailor, or even a single drop of Japanese blood.",
    "Other names of the Japanese sea-god Sagara",
    "[58] are Oho-watatsumi (“sea lord, or sea snake”), and Toyo-tama hiko",

    "[59] During storms, sailors threw jewels into the sea to pacify the dragon king.",
    "Chinese emperors, like the Egyptian Pharaohs, had dragon boats which were used in connection with religious rain-getting ceremonies.",
    "They had also the bird boats called “yih”.",

    "He adds that “the descriptions are contradictory, but its picture rudely resembles a heron”.",
    "[60] It will be gathered from the evidence summarized above that the seafaring activities of the Chinese and Japanese had close associations with the search for precious metals and stones and pearls on the part of those who introduced the Egyptian type of vessels into their waters.",
    "With these ships went many customs and beliefs that became mixed with local customs and beliefs.",
    "New modes of life were introduced, and, with these, new modes of thought.",
    "Nothing persists like immemorial customs, myths, and religious beliefs associated with a particular mode of life.",
    "Before the culture-complexes of China and Japan are investigated, so that local elements may be sifted out from the overlying mass of imported elements, it would be well to deal with the history of the search for wealth across the oceans of the world.",
    "It is necessary, therefore, to turn back again to the cradle of shipbuilding and maritime enterprise—to ancient Egypt with its wonderful civilization of over 3000 years that sent its influences far and wide.",
    "Whether or not the Egyptians ever reached China or Japan, we have no means of knowing.",
    "Pauthier’s view in this connection has come in for a good deal of destructive criticism.",
    "He referred to a Chinese tradition that about 1113 B.C.",
    "the Court was visited by seafarers from the kingdom of “Nili”, and suggested that they came from the Nile valley.",
    "[61] The “Nili”, “Nēlē”, or “Nērē” folk, according to others, came from the direction of Japan or from beyond Korea.",
    "References to them are somewhat obscure.",
    "It does not follow that because Egyptian ships reached China, they were manned by Egyptians.",
    "Ships were, like potter’s wheels, adopted by folks who may never have heard of Egypt.",
    "A culture flows far beyond the areas reached by those who have given it a definite character, just as the Bantu dialects have penetrated to areas in Africa far beyond Bantu control.",
    "What motives, then, stimulated maritime enterprise at the dawn of the history of sea-trafficking?",
    "What attracted the ancient mariners?",
    "If it was wealth, what was “wealth” to them?",
    "The answer to the last query is that wealth was something with a religious significance.",
    "Gold was searched for, but not, to begin with, for the purpose of making coins.",
    "There was no coinage.",
    "Gold was a precious metal in the sense that it brought luck, and to the ancient people “luck” meant everything they yearned for in this world and the next.",
    "As far back as the so-called “Palæolithic period” in western Europe, there was, as has been noted, a systematic search for wealth in the form of sea-shells.",
    "The hunters in central Europe imported shells from the Mediterranean coast and used them as amulets.",
    "These imported shells are found in their graves.",
    "In Ancient Egypt, shells were carried from the Red Sea coast, as well as from the Mediterranean coast, long before the historical period begins.",
    "The evidence of the grave-finds shows that Red Sea pearl-shell and Red Sea cowries were in use for religious purposes.",
    "“Millions of them”, as Maspero has noted, have been found in Ancient Egyptian graves.",
    "In time, pearls came into use, not only pearls from Nile mussels, but from oysters found in the southern part of the Gulf of Aden.",
    "As shipping developed, the pearl-fishers went farther and farther in search of pearls.",
    "The famous ancient pearl area in the Persian Gulf was discovered and drawn upon at some remote period.",
    "No doubt the pearls worn by Assyrian and Persian monarchs came, in part, from the Persian Gulf.",
    "At what period Ceylon pearls were first fished for it is impossible to say.",
    "Of one thing we can be certain, however.",
    "They were fished for by men who used the Egyptian type of vessel.",
    "The migrating and trading pearl-fishers carried their beliefs with them from land to land.",
    "Almost everywhere are found the same beliefs and practices connected with shells and pearls.",
    "These beliefs and practices are of a highly complex character—so complex, indeed, that they must have had an area of origin in which they reflected the beliefs and customs of a people with a history of their own.",
    "The pearl, for instance, was connected with the moon, with the goddess who was the Great Mother, and with the sun and the sun-god.",
    "Venus (Aphrodite) was sea-born.",
    "She was lifted from the sea, by Tritons, seated on a shell.",
    "She was the pearl—the vital essence of the magic shell, and she was the moon, the “Pearl of Heaven”.",
    "The pearl, like the moon, was supposed to exercise an influence over human beings.",
    "In Egypt, the Mother Goddess was symbolized by a cow, and cow, moon, pearl, and shell were connected in an arbitrary way.",
    "In those areas in which the Mother Goddess was symbolized by the sow, the shell was likewise connected with her.",
    "The Greeks applied to the cowry a word that means “little pig”; this word had a special reference to the female sex.",
    "The Romans called the shell “porci”, and porcelain has a like derivation.",
    "[62] As has been shown, women were connected with hand-made pottery, and the pot was a symbol of the Great Mother.",
    "In Scotland, certain shells are still referred to as “cows” and “pigs”.",
    "They were anciently believed to promote fertility and bring luck.",
    "The custom of placing shells on window-sills, at doors, in fire-places, and round garden plots still obtains in parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland.",
    "Some low-reliefs of mother goddesses with baskets of fruit, corn, &c., surviving from the Romano-British period, which have been found in various parts of Britain, have shell-canopies.",
    "The Romans “took over” the goddesses of the peoples of western Europe on whom they imposed their rule, as they took over the Greek pantheon.",
    "Following the clues afforded by the evidence of ships, it is found that the early pearl-fishers coasted round from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf, round India to the Bay of Bengal, round the Malay Peninsula to the China Sea, northwards to the Sea of Okhotsk, and on to the western coast of North America.",
    "Oceania was peopled by the ancient mariners, who appear to have reached by this route the coast of South America.",
    "As we have seen, Africa was circumnavigated.",
    "Western and north-western Europe and the British Isles were reached at a very early period.",
    "The ancient seafarers searched not only for pearls and pearl-shell, but also for gold, silver, copper, tin, and other metals and for precious stones.",
    "They appear to have founded trading colonies that became centres from which cultural influences radiated far and wide.",
    "From these colonies expeditions set out to discover new pearling grounds and new mineral fields.",
    "The search for wealth, having a religious incentive, caused, as has been said, the spread of religious ideas.",
    "In different countries, imported beliefs and customs became mingled with local beliefs and customs, with the result that in many countries are found “culture complexes” which have a historical significance—reflecting as they do the varied experiences of the peoples and the influences introduced into their homelands at various periods.",
    "In the next chapter it will be shown how the dragon of China has a history that throws much light on the early movements of explorers and traders who carried the elements of complex cultures into far distant lands.",

    "The Chinese dragon is a strange mixture of several animals.",
    "Ancient native writers like Wang Fu inform us that it has the head of a camel, the horns of a stag, the eyes of a demon, the ears of a cow, the neck of a snake, the belly of a clam, the scales of a carp, the claws of an eagle, and the soles of a tiger.",
    "On its head is the chiʼih muh lump that (like a “gas-bag”) enables it to soar through the air.",
    "The body has three jointed parts, the first being “head to shoulders”, the second, “shoulders to breast”, and the third, “breast to tail”.",
    "The scales number 117, of which 81 are imbued with good influence (yang) and 36 with bad influence (yin), for the dragon is partly a Preserver and partly a Destroyer.",
    "Under the neck the scales are reversed.",
    "There are five “fingers” or claws on each foot.",
    "The male dragon has whiskers, and under the chin, or in the throat, is a luminous pearl.",
    "There is no denying the importance and significance of that pearl.",
    "A male dragon can be distinguished from a female one by its undulating horn, which is thickest in the upper part.",
    "A female dragon’s nose is straight.",
    "A horned dragon is called kʼiu-lung and a hornless one chʼi-lung.",
    "Some dragons have wings.",
    "In addition there are horse-dragons, snake-dragons, cow-dragons, toad-dragons, dog-dragons, fish-dragons, &c., in China and Japan.",
    "Indeed, all hairy, feathered, and scaled animals are more or less associated with what may be called the “Orthodox Dragon”.",
    "The tiger is an enemy of the dragon, but there are references to tiger-headed dragons.",
    "The dragon is a divinity of water and rain, and the tiger a divinity of mountains and woods.",
    "[63] The white tiger is a god of the west.",
    "Like the deities of other countries, the Chinese dragon-god (and the Japanese dragon) may appear in different shapes—as a youth or aged man, as a lovely girl or an old hag, as a rat, a snake, a fish, a tree, a weapon, or an implement.",
    "But no matter what its shape may be, the dragon is intimately connected with water.",
    "It is a “rain lord” and therefore the thunder-god who causes rain to fall.",
    "The Chinese dragon thus links with the Aryo-Indian god Indra and other rain- and thunder-gods connected with agriculture, including Zeus of Greece, Tarku of Asia Minor, Thor of northern Europe, the Babylonian Marduk (Merodach), &c. There are sea-dragons that send storms like the wind-gods, and may be appeased with offerings.",
    "These are guardians of treasure and especially of pearling-grounds.",
    "Apparently the early pearl-fishers regarded the shark as the guardian of pearls.",
    "It seized and carried away the “robbers” who dived for oysters.",
    "The chief sea-god of China sometimes appeared in shark form—an enormous lion-headed shark.",
    "Procopius, a sixth-century writer, says in this connection: “Sea-dogs are wonderful admirers of the pearl-fish, and follow them out to sea....",
    "A certain fisherman, having watched for the moment when the shell-fish was deprived of the attention of its attendant sea-dog ... seized the shell-fish and made for the shore.",
    "The sea-dog, however, was soon aware of the theft, and, making straight for the fisherman, seized him.",
    "Finding himself thus caught, he made a last effort, and threw the pearl-fish on shore, immediately on which he was torn to pieces by its protector.”",
    "[64] In Polynesia the natives have superstitious ideas about the shark.",
    "“Although”, says Ellis, “they would not only kill but eat certain kinds of shark, the large blue sharks, Squalus glaucus, were deified by them, and, rather than attempt to destroy them, they would endeavour to propitiate their favour by prayers and offerings.",
    "Temples were erected, in which priests officiated, and offerings were presented to the deified sharks, while fishermen, and others who were much at sea, sought their favour.”",
    "[65] Polynesian gods, like Chinese dragons, appeared in various shapes.",
    "“One, for instance,” writes Turner, “saw his god in the eel, another in the shark, another in the turtle, another in the dog, another in the owl, another in the lizard; and so on throughout all the fish of the sea, and birds, and four-footed beasts and creeping things.",
    "In some of the shell-fish, even, gods were supposed to be present.”",
    "[66] Here we meet again with the shell beliefs.",
    "The avatars of dragons had pearls.",
    "In an old Chinese work the story is told of a dragon that appeared in the shape of a little girl sitting at the entrance of a cave and playing with three pearls.",
    "When a man appeared, the child fled into the cave, and, reassuming dragon form, put the pearls in its left ear.",
    "[67] As the guardian of pearls, the Chinese dragon links with the shark-god of the early pearl-fishers.",
    "There were varieties of these sea-gods.",
    "In Polynesia “they had”, Ellis has recorded, “gods who were supposed to preside over the fisheries, and to direct to their coasts the various shoals by which they were periodically visited.”",
    "The Polynesians invoked their aid “either before launching their canoes, or while engaged at sea”.",
    "It is of interest to find in this connection that the dragon had associations with the whale.",
    "Ancient mariners reverenced the whale.",
    "The Ligurians and Cretans carried home portions of the backbones of whales.",
    "[68] The habit of placing spines of fish in graves is of great antiquity in Europe.",
    "The early seafarers who reached California during its prehistoric age perpetuated this very ancient custom.",
    "Beuchat gives an illustration of a kitchen-midden grave in California in which a whale’s vertebra is shown near the human skeleton.",
    "[69] The swashtika appears among the pottery designs of early American pottery.",
    "[70] The ancient Peruvians worshipped the whale, and the Maori dragon was compared to one.",
    "[71] In Scottish folk-lore witches sometimes assume the forms of whales.",
    "The dolphin, the bluish dugong",
    "[72] (probably the “semi-human whale” referred to by Ælian), and other denizens of the sea were regarded as deities by ancient seafarers.",
    "De Groot, in his The Religious System of China, quoting from the Shan hai King, relates that in the Eastern Sea is a “Land of Rolling Waves”.",
    "In this region dwell sea-monsters that are shaped like cows and have blue bodies.",
    "They are hornless and one-legged.",
    "Each time they leave or enter the waters, winds arise and rain comes down.",
    "Their voice is that of thunder and their glare that of sun and moon.",
    "The reference to the single leg may have been suggested by the fact that when the dugong dives the tail comes into view.",
    "This interesting sea-animal has been “recklessly and indiscriminately slaughtered” in historic times.",
    "Classical writers referred to some of the strange monsters seen by their mariners as “sea-cows”.",
    "In like manner the Chinese have connected denizens of the deep with different land animals.",
    "The religious beliefs associated with various sea and land animals cling to that composite god the dragon.",
    "In dealing with it, therefore, we cannot ignore its history, not only in China but in those countries that influenced Chinese civilization, while attention must also be paid to countries that, like China, were influenced by the early sea and land traders and colonists.",
    "In Polynesia the dragon is called mo-o and mo-ko.",
    "“Their (the Polynesian) use of this word in traditions”, says W. D. Westervelt, [73] “showed that they often had in mind animals like crocodiles and alligators, and sometimes they referred the name to any monster of great mythical powers belonging to the man-destroying class.",
    "Mighty eels, immense sea-turtles, large fish of the ocean, fierce sharks, were all called mo-o.",
    "The most ancient dragons of the Hawaiians are spoken of as living in pools or lakes.”",
    "Mr. Westervelt notes that “one dragon lived in the Ewa lagoon, now known as ‘Pearl Harbour’.",
    "This was Kane-kua-ana, who was said to have brought the pipi (oysters) to Ewa.",
    "She [74] was worshipped by those who gather the shell-fish.",
    "When the oysters began to disappear about 1850, the natives said the dragon had become angry and was sending the oysters to Kahiki, or some far-away foreign land.”",
    "It is evident that such a belief is of great antiquity.",
    "The pearl under the chin of the Chinese dragon has, as will be seen, an interesting history.",
    "But, it may be asked here, what connection has a mountain stag with the ancient pearl-fishers?",
    "As Wang Fu reminds us, the pearl-guarding Chinese dragon has “the horns of a stag”.",
    "It was sometimes called, De Groot states, [75] “the celestial stag”—the “stag of the sky”.",
    "This was not merely a poetic image.",
    "The sea-god Ea of ancient Babylonia was in one of his forms “the goat fish”, as some put it.",
    "Professor Sayce says, in this connection, “Ea was called ‘the antelope of the deep’, ‘the antelope the creator’, ‘the lusty antelope’.",
    "He was sometimes referred to as ‘a gazelle’.",
    "Lubin, ‘a stag’, was a reduplicated form of elim, ‘a gazelle’.",
    "Both words were equivalent to sarru, ‘king’.”",
    "[76] Whatever the Ea land animal was—whether goat, gazelle, antelope, or stag—it was associated with a sea-god who, according to Babylonian belief, brought the elements of culture to the ancient Sumerians, who were developing their civilization at the seaport of Eridu, then situated at the head of the Persian Gulf, in which pearls were found.",
    "Ea was depicted as half a land animal and half a fish, or as a man wrapped in the skin of a gigantic fish as Egyptian deities were wrapped in the skins of wild beasts.",
    "One of Ea’s names was Dagan, which was possibly the Dagon worshipped also by the Philistines and by the inhabitants of Canaan before the Philistines arrived from Kaphtor (the land of Keftiu, i.e. Crete).",
    "Ea was associated with the dragon Tiamat, which his son Marduk (Merodach) slew.",
    "It is stated in Babylonian script that Ea “conferred his name” on Marduk.",
    "In other words, Marduk supplanted Ea and took over certain of his attributes, and part of his history.",
    "He was the god of Babylon, which supplanted other cities, formerly capitals; he therefore supplanted the chief gods of these cities.",
    "Ea was originally the slayer of the dragon Tiamat and the conqueror of the watery abyss over which he reigned, supplanting the dragon.",
    "[77] He became the dragon himself—the “goat fish” or “antelope of the deep”—the composite deity connected with animals deified by ancient hunters and fishers whose beliefs were ultimately fused with those of others with whom they were brought into close association in centres of culture.",
    "Ea, who had a dragon form, was connected with the serpent, or “worm”, as well as with the fish.",
    "In Egypt Horus, Osiris, and Set were associated with the gazelle.",
    "Osiris was, in one of his forms, the River Nile.",
    "He was not only the Nile itself, but the controller of it; he was the serpent and soul of the Nile, and he was the ocean into which the Nile flowed, and the leviathan of the deep.",
    "In the Pyramid texts Osiris is addressed: “Thou art great, thou art green, in thy name of Great-green (sea); lo, thou art round as the Great Circle (Okeanos); lo, thou art turned about, thou art round as the circle that encircles the Hauneba (Ægeans)”.",
    "[78] Osiris was thus the serpent (dragon) that, lying in the ocean, encircled the world.",
    "His son Horus is at one point in the Pyramid texts (Nos.",
    "1505–8) narrative “represented as crossing the sea”.",
    "[79] Horus was sometimes depicted riding on the back of a gazelle or antelope.",
    "The Egyptian antelope-god was in time fused with the serpent or dragon of the sea.",
    "Referring to the evidence of Frobenius",
    "[80] in this connection, Professor Elliot Smith says that “in some parts of Africa, especially in the west, the antelope plays the part of the dragon in Asiatic stories”.",
    "[81] When we reach India, it is found that the wind-god, Vayu, rides on the back of the antelope.",
    "Vayu was fused with Indra, the slayer of the dragon that controlled the water-supply, and, indeed, retained it by enclosing it as the Osiris serpent of Egypt, or the serpent-mother of Osiris, enclosed the water in its cavern during the period of “the low Nile”, before the inundation took place.",
    "[82] After Osiris, as the water-confining serpent (dragon) was slain, the river ran red with his blood and rose in flood.",
    "Osiris, originally “a dangerous god”, [83] was the “new” or “fresh” water of the inundation.",
    "“The tradition of his unfavourable character”, Breasted comments, “survived in vague reminiscences long centuries after he had gained wide popularity.”",
    "Osiris ultimately became “the kindly dispenser of plenty”, and his slayer, Set, originally a beneficent deity, was made the villain of the story and fused with the dragon Apep, the symbol of darkness and evil.",
    "This change appears to have been effected after the introduction of the agricultural mode of life.",
    "The Nile, formerly the destroyer, then became the preserver, sustainer, and generous giver of “soul substance” and daily bread.",
    "When the agricultural mode of life was introduced into China the horned-dragon, or horned-serpent (for the dragon, Chinese writers remind us, has “the nature of a serpent”), became the Osiris water-serpent.",
    "How a snake becomes a dragon is explained in the Shu",
    "i ki, which says: “A water-snake after 500 years changes into a kiao, a kiao after 1000 years changes into a lung; [84] a lung after 500 years changes into a kioh-lung, [85] and after 1000 years into a ying-lung.",
    "[86]” In Japan is found, in addition, the pʼan-lung (“coiled dragon”), which has not yet ascended to heaven.",
    "[87] The “coiled dragon” is evidently the water-retaining monster.",
    "The Chinese dragon is as closely connected with water as was the serpent form of Osiris with the Nile in ancient Egypt, and as was Indra with the “drought dragon” in India.",
    "The dragon dwells in pools, it rises to the clouds, it thunders and brings rain, it floods rivers, it is in the ocean, and controls the tides and causes the waters to ebb and flow as do its magic pearls (the “Jewels of Flood and Ebb”), and it is a symbol of the emperor.",
    "The Egyptian Pharaoh was an “avatar” of Osiris, or Horus, [88] and the Chinese emperor was an “avatar” or incarnation of the dragon.",
    "As water destroys, the dragon is a destroyer; as water preserves and sustains, the dragon is a preserver and sustainer.",
    "The dragon, as has been indicated, is essentially the Chinese water-god.",
    "“The ancient texts ... are short,” says de Visser, “but sufficient to give us the main conceptions of old China with regard to the dragon.",
    "He was in those early days, just like now, the god of water, thunder, clouds, and rain, the harbinger of blessings, and the symbol of holy men.",
    "As the emperors are the holy beings of earth, the idea of the dragon being the symbol of imperial power is based upon this ancient conception.”",
    "[89] The Chinese “dragon well” is usually situated inside a deep mountain cave.",
    "It was believed that the well owed its origin to the dragon.",
    "De Visser quotes, in this connection, from an ancient sage, who wrote: “When the yellow dragon, born from yellow gold a thousand years old, enters a deep place, a yellow spring dashes forth, and if from this spring some particles (fine dust) arise, these become a yellow cloud”.",
    "A famous dragon well is situated at the top of Mount Pien, in Hu-cheu.",
    "It flows from a cave, and is called “Golden Well Spring”.",
    "The cave is known as the “Golden Well Cave”, and is supposed to be so deep that no one can reach the end of it.",
    "There was a dragon well near Jerusalem.",
    "[90] Other dragon wells are found as far west as Ireland and Scotland.",
    "A cave with wells, called the “Dropping Cave”, at Cromarty, has a demon in its inner recesses.",
    "The Corycian cave of the Anatolian Typhoon is one of similar character.",
    "According to Greek legend, this hundred-headed monster, from whose eyes lightning flashes, will one day send hail, floods, and rivers of fire to lay waste Sicilian farms.",
    "[91] The floods of the River Rhone were supposed to be caused by the “drac”.",
    "In Egypt Set became the “roaring serpent”, who crept into a hole in the ground, “wherein he hid himself and lived”.",
    "He had previously taken the shapes of the crocodile and the hippopotamus to escape Horus, the Egyptian “dragon slayer”.",
    "In China the season of drought is winter.",
    "The dragons are supposed to sleep in their pools during the dry spell, and that is why, in the old Chinese work, Yih Lin, it is stated that “a dragon hidden in water is useless”.",
    "The dragons are supposed to sleep so that they may “preserve their bodies”.",
    "They begin to stir and rise in spring.",
    "Soon they fight with one another, so that there is no need for a Horus, a Merodach, or an Indra to compel them, by waging battle, to bring benefits to mankind.",
    "The Chinese welcome what they called a “dragon battle” after the dry season.",
    "Thunder-storms break out, and rain pours down in torrents.",
    "If a number of dragons engage in battle, and the war in the air continues longer than is desired, the rivers rise in flood and cause much destruction and loss of life.",
    "As the emperor was closely connected with the chief dragon-god, social upheavals and war might result, it was anciently believed, in consequence of the failure of the priests and the emperor (the holiest of priests) to control the dragons.",
    "The dynasty might be overthrown by the indignant and ruined peasantry.",
    "Among the curious superstitions entertained in China regarding dragon battles, is one that no mortal should watch them.",
    "It was not only unlucky but perilous for human beings to peer into the mysteries.",
    "De Visser quotes a Chinese metrical verse in this connection: When they fight, the dragons do not look at us; Why should we look at them when they are fighting?",
    "If we do not seek the dragons, They also will not seek us.",
    "[92] In Gaelic Scotland the serpent, which is associated with the goddess Bride, sleeps all winter and comes forth on 1st February (old style), known as “Bride’s day”.",
    "A Gaelic verse tells in this connection: The serpent will come from the home On the brown day of Bride, Though there should be three feet of snow On the flat surface of the ground.",
    "[93] As in China, a compact was made with the Bride serpent or dragon: To-day is the Day of Bride, The serpent shall come from his hole, I will not molest the serpent, And the serpent will not molest me.",
    "It is evident that some very ancient belief, connected with the agricultural mode of life, lies behind these curious verses in such far-separated countries as Scotland and China.",
    "Bride and her serpent come forth to inaugurate the season of fruitfulness as do the battling dragons in the Far East.",
    "When Chinese dragons fight, fire-balls and pearls fall to the ground.",
    "Pearls give promise of abundant supplies of water in the future.",
    "It is necessary, if all is to go well with the agriculturist, that the blue and yellow dragons should prevail over the others.",
    "The blue dragon is the chief spirit of water and rain, and this is the deity that presides during the spring season.",
    "A glimpse is afforded of the mental habits of the early searchers for precious or sacred metals and jewels by the beliefs entertained in China regarding the origin of the dragon-gods.",
    "These were supposed to have been hatched from stones, especially beautiful stones.",
    "The colours of stones were supposed to reveal the characters of the spirits that inhabited them.",
    "In Egypt, for instance, the blue turquoise was connected with the mother-goddess Hathor, who was, among other things, a deity of the sky and therefore the controller of the waters above the firmament as well as of the Nile.",
    "She was the mother of sun and moon.",
    "She was appealed to for water by the agriculturists and for favourable winds by the seafarers.",
    "The symbol used on such occasions was a blue stone.",
    "It was a “luck stone” that exercised an influence on the elements controlled by the goddess.",
    "In the Hebrides a blue stone used to be reverenced by the descendants of ancient sea-rovers.",
    "Martin in his Western Isles tells of such a stone, said to be always wet, which was preserved in a chapel dedicated to St. Columba on the Island of Fladda.",
    "“It is an ordinary custom,” he has written, “when any of the fishermen are detained in the isle by contrary winds, to wash the blue stone with water all round, expecting thereby to procure a favourable wind, which, the credulous tenant living in the isle says, never fails, especially if a stranger wash the stone.”",
    "Why a “stranger”?",
    "Was this curious custom introduced of old by strangers who had crossed the deep?",
    "Had the washing ceremony its origin in the custom of pouring out libations practised by those who came from an area in which a complex religious culture had grown up, and where men had connected a deity, originally associated with the water-supply and therefore with the food-supply, with tempests and ocean-tides and the sky?",
    "The Chinese, who called certain beautiful stones “dragon’s eggs”, believed that when they split, lightning flashed and thunder bellowed and darkness came on.",
    "The new-born dragons ascended to the sky.",
    "Before the dragons came forth, much water poured from the stone.",
    "As in the Hebrides, the dragon stone had, it would appear, originally an association with the fertilizing water-deity.",
    "The new-born Chinese dragon is no bigger than a worm, or a baby serpent or lizard, but it grows rapidly.",
    "Evidently beliefs associated with the water-snake deities were fused with those regarding coloured stones.",
    "The snake was the soul of the river.",
    "Osiris as the Nile was a snake.",
    "His mother had, therefore, a snake form.",
    "The haunting memory of the goddess-mother of water-spirits clings to the “dragon mother” of a Chinese legend related by ancient writers, a version of which is summarized by de Visser.",
    "[94] Once, it runs, an old woman found five “dragon eggs” lying in the grass.",
    "When they split (as in Egypt “the mountain of dawn” splits to give birth to the sun), this woman carried the little serpents to a river and let them go.",
    "For this service she was given the power to foretell future events.",
    "She became a sibyl—a priestess.",
    "The people called her “The Dragon Mother.”",
    "When she washed clothes at the river-side, the fishes, who were subjects of dragons, “used to dance before her”.",
    "In various countries certain fish were regarded as forms of the shape-changing dragon.",
    "The Gaelic dragon sometimes appeared as the salmon, and a migratory fish was in Egypt associated with Osiris and his “mother”.",
    "When the Chinese “Dragon Mother” died, she was buried on the eastern side of the river.",
    "Why, it may be asked, on the eastern side?",
    "Was it because, being originally a goddess, she was regarded as the “mother” of the sun-god of the east—the mother who was “the mountain of dawn” and whose influence was concentrated in the blue stone?",
    "The Chinese dragon of the east is blue, and the blue dragon is associated with spring—the first-born season of the year.",
    "But apparently the dragons objected to the burial of the “Dragon Mother” on the eastern bank.",
    "The legend tells that they raised a violent storm, and transferred her grave to the western bank.",
    "Until the present age the belief obtains that there is always wind and rain near the “Dragon Mother’s Grave”.",
    "The people explain that the dragons love to “wash the grave”.",
    "Here we find the dragons pouring out libations, as did the worshippers of the Great Mother who came from a distant land.",
    "The god of the western quarter is white, and presides over the autumn season of fruitfulness.",
    "Just before the “birth” of autumn the Chinese address their prayers to the mountains and hills.",
    "In ancient Egypt the conflict between the Solar and Osirian cults was a conflict between the “cult of the east” and the “cult of the west”.",
    "Professor Breasted notes that although Osiris is “First of the Westerners” (the west being his quarter) “he goes to the east (after death) in the Pyramid texts (of the solar cult) and the pair, Isis and Nepthys (the goddess), carry the dead into the east”.",
    "The east was the place where the ascent to the sky was made.",
    "In Egyptian solar theology it combined with the south.",
    "The rivalry between the two cults is reflected in one particular Pyramid text in which “the dead is adjured to go to the west in preference to the east, in order to join the sun-god!”",
    "But to the solar cult the east was “the most sacred of all regions”.",
    "In the Pyramid texts it is found that “the old doctrine of the ‘west’ as the permanent realm of the dead, a doctrine which is later so prominent, has been quite submerged by the pre-eminence of the east”.",
    "[95] This east-and-west theological war, then, had its origin in Egypt.",
    "How did it reach China, there to be enshrined in the legend of the Dragon Mother?",
    "Can it be held that it was “natural” the Chinese should have invented a legend which had so significant and ancient a history in the homeland of the earliest seafarers?",
    "The dragon-gods that presided over the seasons and the divisions of the world were five in number.",
    "At the east was the blue (or green) god associated with spring, at the west the white god associated with autumn, at the north the black god associated with winter (the Chinese season of drought), and at the south were two gods, the red and the yellow; the red god presided during the greater part of summer, the rule of the yellow god being confined to the last month.",
    "The dragons were life-givers not only as the gods who presided over the seasons and ensured the food-supply, but as those who gave cures for diseases.",
    "The “Red Cloud herb” and other curative herbs were found after a thunderstorm beside the dragon-haunted pools.",
    "De Groot [96] tells that fossil bones were called “dragon bones”, and were used for medicinal purposes.",
    "The dragons were supposed to cast off their bones as well as their skins.",
    "Bones of five colours (the colours of the five dragons) were regarded as the most effective.",
    "White and yellow bones came next in favour.",
    "Black bones were “of inferior quality”.",
    "The Shu King, a famous Chinese historical classic, [97] tells that the dragons’ bones come from Tsin land.",
    "It is noted that the five-coloured ones are the best.",
    "The blue, yellow, red, white, and black ones, according to their colours, correspond with the viscera, as do the five chih (felicitous plants), the five crystals (shih ying), and the five kinds of mineral bole (shih chi).",
    "De Groot",
    "[98] gives the colours connected with the internal organs as follows: 1. Blue—liver and gall.",
    "2. White—lungs and small intestines.",
    "3. Red—heart and large intestines.",
    "4. Black—kidneys and bladder.",
    "5.",
    "Yellow—spleen and stomach.",
    "Apparently the special curative quality of a dragon’s bone was revealed by its colour.",
    "The gods of the various “mansions” influenced different organs of the human body.",
    "In ancient Egypt the internal organs were placed in jars and protected by the Horuses of the cardinal points.",
    "The god of the north had charge of the small viscera, the god of the south of the stomach and large intestines, the god of the west of liver and gall, and the god of the east of heart and lungs.",
    "The Egyptian north was red and symbolized by the Red Crown, and the south was white and symbolized by the White Crown.",
    "In Mexico the colours white, red, and yellow were connected with different internal organs, and black with a disembowelled condition.",
    "It is evident that the sea and land traders carried their strange stocks of medical knowledge over vast areas.",
    "It is not without significance to find in this connection that, according to Chinese belief, there was an island on which dragons’ bones were found.",
    "The dragons are not only rain-gods and gods of the four quarters and the seasons, but also “light-gods”, connected with sun and moon, day and night.",
    "In the Yih lin there is a reference to a black dragon which vomits light and causes darkness to turn into light.",
    "The mountain dragon of Mount Chung is called the “Enlightener of Darkness”.",
    "“When it opens its eyes it is day, when it shuts its eyes it is night.",
    "Blowing he makes winter, exhaling he makes summer.",
    "The wind is its breath.”",
    "[99] In like manner the Egyptian Ra and Ptah are universal gods, the sun and moon being their “eyes”.",
    "Even Osiris, as far back as the Pyramid period, was the source of all life and a world-god.",
    "He was addressed: “The soil is on thy arm, its corners are upon thee as far as the four pillars of the sky.",
    "When thou movest the earth trembles....",
    "As for thee, the Nile comes forth from the sweat of thy hands.",
    "Thou spewest out the wind....”",
    "[100] Osiris sent water to bring fertility as do the dragons, air for the life-breath of man and beast, and also light, which was, of course, fire (the heat which is life).",
    "The idea of the life-principle being in fire and water lies behind Wang Fu’s statement: “Dragon fire and human fire are opposite.",
    "If dragon fire comes into contact with wetness, it flames; and if it meets water, it burns.",
    "If one drives it (the dragon) away by means of fire, it stops burning and its flames are extinguished.”",
    "[101] Celestial fire is something different from ordinary fire.",
    "The “vital spark” is of celestial origin—purer and holier than ordinary fire.",
    "Dragon skins, even when cast off, shine by night.",
    "So do pearls, coral, and precious stones “shine in darkness” in the Chinese myths.",
    "One traces the influence of the solar cult in the idea that the dragon’s vital spirit is in its eyes.",
    "It is because iron blinds a dragon that it fears that metal.",
    "In Egypt the eye of Horus is blinded by Set, whose metal is iron.",
    "There is a quaint mixture of religious ideas in the Chinese custom of carrying in procession through the streets, on the 15th of the first month, a dragon made of bamboo, linen, and paper.",
    "In front of it is borne a red ball.",
    "De Groot says that this is the azure dragon, the head of which rose as a star to usher in spring at the beginning.",
    "[102] In like manner the Egyptian “spring” is ushered in by the star Sirius, the mother of the sun, from which falls a tear that causes the inundation.",
    "But although the red ball may have been a solar symbol, it is also connected with the moon.",
    "The Chinese themselves call the ball “The Pearl of Heaven”—that is, “the moon”.",
    "An inscription on porcelain brings this out clearly.",
    "Mr. Blacker has translated the text below two dragons rushing towards a ball as “A couple of dragons facing the moon”.",
    "[103] The dragons were not only moon- and sun-“devourers” who caused eclipses, but guardians of these orbs in their capacities as gods of the four quarters.",
    "The all-absorbing dragon appears even as a vampire.",
    "A tiger-headed dragon with the body of a snake seizes human beings, covers them with saliva, and sucks blood from under their armpits.",
    "“No blood is left when they stop sucking.”",
    "[104] In Japanese legends dragons as white eels draw blood from the legs of horses that enter a river.",
    "[105] Evil or sick dragons send bad rain.",
    "The gods ride on dragons, and therefore emperors and holy men can also use them as vehicles.",
    "Yu, the founder of the Hea Dynasty, had a carriage drawn by two dragons.",
    "Ghosts sometimes appear riding on dragons and wearing blue hats.",
    "The souls of the dead are conveyed to the Celestial regions by the winged gods.",
    "Dragons appear when great men are born.",
    "[106] Emperors had dragon ancestors.",
    "The Emperor Yaou was the son of a red dragon; one Japanese emperor had a dragon’s tail, being a descendant of the sea-god.",
    "[107] In the next chapter it will be shown that in Chinese dragon-lore it is possible to detect with certainty the sources of certain “layers” that were superimposed on primitive conceptions regarding these deities.",
    "CHAPTER VI BIRD AND SERPENT MYTHS Culture Complexes in Dragon-lore—Polynesian Dragon Beliefs—Oceanic and African Fish-gods—Reptile Deities where no Reptiles are found—Chinese Dragons and Indian Nagas—Dragon-links between India, Tibet, China, and Japan—Birds and Snakes—Distribution of Egyptian “Winged Disk”—Horus and the “Secretary Bird”—Indian Mungoose supplants “Secretary Bird”—Mungoose form of God of Riches and Death—Bird and Serpent combined in Dragon—Babylonian Dragon was a combination of Eagle, Serpent, and Lion—Tree Forms of the Chinese Dragon, the Polynesian Mo-o, and the Indian Nagas—The Dragon, the Salmon, the Tree, and the “Thunder-bird”.",
    "The intensive study of a country’s beliefs and ideas, as revealed in its myths and legends, is greatly facilitated by the adoption of the comparative method.",
    "It may not always be found possible to identify areas in which certain beliefs had origin, but when we detect, as we do in China, myths similar to those found in other lands, and especially highly complex myths, that had origin in one particular country and received additions in another, the imported elements may be sifted out from a local religious system without much difficulty.",
    "The Chinese dragon has distinct and outstanding Chinese characteristics, but it is obviously not entirely a Chinese creation.",
    "Attached to the “composite wonder beast” are complex ideas that have a history outside China, as well as those ideas that reflect Chinese natural phenomena and Chinese experiences and habits of life and thought.",
    "The fused beliefs, as symbolized by the dragon, have passed through a prolonged process of local development, but those that were imported have not, it is found, been entirely divested of their distinctive characteristics, and remain preserved as flies are in amber.",
    "Interesting and important evidence that throws light on the history of the Chinese dragon is found in Polynesia, India, and Babylonia, and even in Egypt and Europe.",
    "The cultural influence of Babylonia, which radiated over a wide area for a score of centuries or longer, is traceable in India, and, as is well known, Buddhist India exercised a strong cultural influence on China.",
    "But, as will be shown, Babylonian influence reached the Shensi province of China long before the Aryans entered India.",
    "Buddhist ideas regarding the pearl-protecting dragon-god of water and fire were evidently superimposed in China upon earlier Babylonian ideas regarding the water-dragon, which had no particular connection with pearls.",
    "At any rate, there is no mention of pearls in the Babylonian myth.",
    "When it is found that many of the ideas connected with the Chinese dragon were prevalent in Polynesia, what conclusion is to be drawn?",
    "There is no evidence that Chinese culture was an active force in New Zealand or Hawaii, for instance.",
    "It cannot have been from China that the Polynesians derived their dragon, or their beliefs connected with the serpent, a reptile unknown to the islanders at first hand.",
    "The only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn is that the Chinese and the Polynesians were influenced at an early period by intruders from other lands.",
    "The Polynesian intruders must necessarily have been sea-traders.",
    "Of course, the Polynesians may themselves have imported their dragon beliefs from their homeland.",
    "That homeland, however, was certainly not China.",
    "The Polynesian Mo-o or Mo-ko (dragon) had, as was shown in the last chapter, a connection with pearls.",
    "“On Maui”, writes W. D. Westervelt, [108] “the greatest dragon of the island was Kiha-wahine.",
    "The natives had the saying, ‘Kiha has mana, or miraculous power, like Mo-o-inanea’.",
    "She lived in a large, deep pool on the edge of the village Lahaina, and was worshipped by the royal family of Maui as their special guardian.”",
    "Royal families were invariably the descendants of intruding conquerors.",
    "It is of special interest, therefore, to find the Polynesian dragon-god connected with a military aristocracy.",
    "The Rev. George Brown, missionary and explorer, refers to similar dragon beliefs among the people of New Britain.",
    "He tells of a spring connected with the woman (goddess) who caused the deluge.",
    "The natives “say that an immense fish lives in it, which will come out when they call it”.",
    "The belief obtains among the Melanesians “that the creator of all things was a woman”.",
    "She “made all lands” and “the natives prayed” to her “when an eclipse of the sun or the moon took place”.",
    "[109] The king of Samoan gods was a dragon.",
    "“This god”, Brown tells, “had the body of a man to the breast only, and the body of an eel (muræna) below.",
    "This eel’s body lies down in the ocean, and from the chest to the head lies down in the house.",
    "This is the god to whom all things are reported.",
    "The inferior gods are his attendants.”",
    "[110] Gods half human and half reptile, or half human and half fish, are found in various countries.",
    "In the British Museum are bronze reliefs of the King of Benin (as the representative of his chief deity) half shark and half man.",
    "The kings of Dahomey were depicted as sharks with bodies covered with scales; their statues are in the Trocadero, Paris.",
    "[111] That the Polynesian reptile deities were imported there can be no doubt.",
    "As early as 1825 Mr. Bloxam, the English naval chaplain, drew this necessary conclusion.",
    "In his The Voyage of the Blonde he says: “At the bottom of the Parre (pali) there are two large stones, on which even now offerings of fruit and flowers are laid to propitiate the Aku-wahines, or goddesses, who are supposed to have the power of granting a safe passage”.",
    "Referring to the female mo-o, or reptile deities, Mr. Bloxam says it was difficult for him to get an explanation of their name, the Hawaiians having “nothing of the shape of serpents or large reptiles in their islands”.",
    "[112] But the closest analogy to the Chinese dragon is found in India.",
    "The Nagas (serpent-gods), which were taken over by the Buddhists, and the Chinese dragons have much in common.",
    "“Cobras in their ordinary shape,” writes Dr. Rhys Davids of the Nagas, “they lived beneath the waters like mermen and mermaids, in great luxury and wealth, more especially of gems.”",
    "Sometimes the tree-spirits (dryads) are called Nagas.",
    "“They could at will, and often did, adopt the human form; and though terrible if angered, were kindly and mild by nature.”",
    "[113] Kerns says “that the Nagas are water-spirits represented, as a rule, in human shapes, with a crown of serpents on their heads”, and also as “snake-like beings resembling clouds”.",
    "[114] They are “demi-gods”.",
    "Like the Chinese dragons, the Nagas are guardians of the four quarters of the universe.",
    "There are withal Nagas in the sea who control winds and tides, and one of the Naga kings is Sagara, who is a Neptune in Japan.",
    "The Nagas are also “Lords of the Earth”, and send drought and disease when offended or neglected.",
    "Ea, the sea-god of the early Babylonians, was known also as Enki, “The Lord of the Earth”.",
    "In Buddhist art the Naga is shown in three forms: (1) as a human being with a snake on or poised over the head, reminding one of the Egyptian kings or queens who wear the uræus symbol on their foreheads; (2) as half human and half snake (the “mermaid form”); and (3) as ordinary snakes.",
    "The first form is found not only in India, but in Tibet, China, and Japan.",
    "Human-shaped Nagas are depicted worshipping Buddha, as they stand in water.",
    "In Tibet, the Naga is shown with the upper part of the body in human shape and the lower in snake shape; there are horns on the head and wings spreading out from the shoulders.",
    "The same form is found in Japan.",
    "This Tibetan link between the Indian Naga and the Chinese Dragon is important.",
    "The bird-god has been blended with the snake-god.",
    "In India the bird-gods (Garudas) are enemies of the Nagas (snakes), and Garudas in “eagle shape” are found depicted in low relief, carrying off Nagas in snake shape.",
    "This eternal conflict between eagle-like birds and serpents is one of the features of Babylonian mythology.",
    "The story of Zu, the Babylonian Eagle-god, is found on tablets that were stored in the library of the great Assyrian King, Ashur-bani-pal.",
    "Zu, it is related, stole from the gods the “tablets of destiny”, and was pursued and caught by Shamash, the sun-god.",
    "In one version of the myth Zu, the eagle, is punished by the serpent, which conceals itself in the body of an ox.",
    "When the eagle comes to feast on the flesh it is seized by the serpent and slain.",
    "In Polynesia the eternal conflict between bird-god and serpent-god is illustrated in wood-carvings.",
    "The Egyptian winged disk, as adopted by the islanders, shows the bird in the centre with a struggling snake in its beak.",
    "The Central American peoples had likewise this bird-and-serpent myth.",
    "Indeed, it figures prominently in their mythologies.",
    "In Mexico the winged disk was placed, as in Egypt, above the entrances to the temples.",
    "The bird-and-serpent myth is to be found even in the Iliad.",
    "When Hector set forth with his heroes to break through the wall of the Achæan camp, an eagle appeared in the air, bearing in its talons “a blood-red monstrous snake, alive and struggling still”.",
    "The writhing snake manages to sting the eagle, which immediately drops it.",
    "[115] In ancient Egyptian myths the bird was the Horus hawk and the serpent was Set.",
    "Horus assumed, in his great battle against the snake, crocodile, and other enemies of Ra, the winged disk form—the winged sun, protected by the two snake-goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt.",
    "This strange combination of deities in the “winged disk” symbol was as distinctively an Egyptian cultural and political complex as the Union Jack is distinctively a British complex.",
    "As the Union Jack has been carried to many a distant land, so was the Egyptian winged disk, “the flag” of Egyptian culture.",
    "In those areas in which the winged disk is found, are found also traces of Egyptian ideas which, of course, were not necessarily introduced by the Egyptians themselves.",
    "How did this myth of the struggle between bird and serpent have origin?",
    "The only country in the world in which a great bird hunts serpents is Africa.",
    "The bird in question is the famous secretary bird (Serpentarius secretarius), which is nowadays domesticated by South African farmers so as to keep down snakes.",
    "It is found in East and West Africa.",
    "“In general appearance it looks like a modified eagle mounted on stilts.”",
    "[116] The bird attacks a snake with wings outspread, and flaps them in front of its body to prevent itself from being bitten during the conflict.",
    "Early Egyptian seafarers were no doubt greatly impressed when, “in the land of Punt”, they saw these strange birds, with heads like eagles or hawks, standing over snakes they had clutched in their talons, and then flying away with them dangling from their beaks.",
    "The mariners’ stories about the snake-devouring bird appear to have crept into the mythology of Egypt, with the result that the Horus hawk became the hunter of Set in his “hissing serpent” form.",
    "Above the hole in the ground into which the Set serpent fled for concealment and safety was set a pole surmounted by the head of the Horus hawk.",
    "As Dr. Budge puts it: “Horus, the son of Isis, stood upon him (Set) in the form of a pole or staff, on the top of which was the head of a hawk”.",
    "[117] But, one may urge, it could not have been until after Egyptian vessels visited the coasts haunted by the secretary bird that the bird and serpent variation of the Horus-Set myth was formulated in the land of Egypt, whence, apparently, it was distributed far and wide.",
    "Horus was not necessarily an enemy of serpents, seeing that there are two in his disk.",
    "In Tibet, as has been stated, the bird and serpent were combined, and the “composite beast” was given a human head with horns.",
    "The horned and winged dragon of China is thus, in part, a combination of the original secretary bird and the snake.",
    "The later blending process was, no doubt, due to Buddhistic influence.",
    "Both Nagas (snakes) and Garudas (eagles or secretary birds) were included in northern India among the gods and demons who worshipped Buddha.",
    "The Nagas understood the language of birds.",

    "In the Mahábhárata, the Pandava hero Arjuna is, after being slain in combat, restored to life by his Naga wife, who had obtained this magic jewel from the Naga king.",
    "[119] The Nagas are guardians of pearls, and the females have many pearl necklaces.",
    "Note may here be taken of interesting Indian evidence that throws light on the process of transferring to a local animal complex ideas associated with another animal figuring in an imported myth.",
    "The great enemy of African snakes is, as has been said, the secretary bird; the Indian enemy is the mungoose.",
    "In early Buddhist art the mungoose, spitting jewels, is placed in the right hand of Kubera, god of wealth, who stands on the back of a Yaksha (a bird demon).",
    "By devouring snakes (Nagas) the mungoose (according to the myth) “appropriates their jewels, and has hence developed into the attribute of Kubera”.",
    "[120] Here the pearl-guarding shark, having become a jewel-guarding dragon-snake, is substituted by the jewel-spitting mungoose which has “devoured” its attributes.",
    "The god Kubera has a heaven of its own, and is a form of Yama, god of death.",
    "In his form as Dharma, god of justice, Yama figures in the Mahábhárata [121] as a “blue-eyed mungoose with one side of his body changed into gold”, his voice being “loud and deep as thunder”.",
    "Here Yama links with Indra, god of thunder, who, having a heaven of his own, is also a god of death.",
    "Egypt had its “blue-eyed Horus”.",
    "[122] The god Horus was the living form of Osiris.",
    "The living Pharaoh was a Horus, and the dead Pharaoh an Osiris, as Dr. Gardiner reminds us.",
    "The combination of bird and serpent is found in Persia as well as in Tibet.",
    "On an archaic cylinder seal from the ancient Elamite capital of Susa, the dragon is a lion with an eagle’s head and wings; the forelegs are those of the eagle, and the hind legs those of a lion.",
    "A form of the god Tammuz, namely the god Nin-Girsu (“Lord of Girsu”) of the Sumerian city of Lagash (Girsu appears to have been a suburb), was a lion-headed eagle.",
    "[123] The god Ea had a dragon form.",
    "[124] The dragon of the Ishtar gate of Babylon is a combination of eagle, serpent, and lion, and is horned.",
    "There can remain little doubt that the Chinese dragon has an interesting history, not only in China but outside that country.",
    "It cannot be held to have independent origin.",
    "At a remote period dragon beliefs reached China, India, and Polynesia, and even America.",
    "[125] In each separated area the dragon took on a local colouring, but the fundamental beliefs connected with it remained the same.",
    "It was closely connected with water (the “water of life”), and also with trees (the “trees of life”).",
    "Thus we find that in China a dragon might assume “the shape of a tree growing under water”; [126] a boat once collided with drift-wood which was found to be a dragon.",
    "Crocodiles are sometimes mistaken for logs of wood.",
    "In Hawaii two noted dragons (mo-o) lived in a river.",
    "“They were called ‘the moving boards’ which made a bridge across the river.”",
    "[127] The Indian Nagas were not only water deities but tree spirits, as Dr. Rhys Davids has emphasized.",
    "[128] Behind dragon worship is a complex of beliefs connected with what is usually called “tree and well worship”.",
    "In Gaelic stories, the sacred tree is guarded by the “beast” in the sacred well, and a form of the “beast” (dragon) is the salmon; in the tree is the “thunder bird”.",
    "Dragon, tree, and bird are connected with the god of thunder who sends rain.",
    "When Buddhism reached China, imported Naga beliefs were superimposed on earlier Chinese beliefs connected with the dragon-god who controlled the rain-supply, as Osiris in Egypt controlled the Nile, and the Babylonian Ea the Euphrates.",
    "In the next chapter various beliefs connected with the dragon are brought out in representative legends.",

    "In Chinese and Japanese folk-stories the dragons have fish forms or avatars.",
    "They may be eels, carps, or migratory fish like the salmon.",
    "It is believed that those fish that ascend a river’s “dragon gate” become dragons, while those that remain behind continue to be fish.",
    "Dragons are closely associated with waterfalls.",
    "They haunt in one or other of their forms the deep pools below them.",
    "In western European stories, dragons and gods of fire and water assume the forms of fish, and hide themselves in pools.",
    "Loki of Icelandic legend has a salmon form.",

    "He is closely associated with the “dragon-woman”, and is the father of monsters, including the moon-swallowing wolf-dragon.",
    "Andvari, the guardian of Nibelung treasure, has a pike form.",
    "[130] In Gaelic legend the salmon is the source of wisdom and of the power to foretell events.",
    "Finn (Fionn) tastes of the “Salmon of Knowledge” when it is being cooked, and immediately becomes a seer.",
    "Michael Scott, in like manner, derives wisdom from the “juices” of the white snake.",
    "The salmon is, in Gaelic, a form of the dragon.",
    "The dragon of Lough Bel Séad [131] (Lake of the Jewel Mouth), in Ireland, was caught “in the shape of a salmon”.",
    "Sigurd, the dragon-slayer of Norse Icelandic stories, eats the dragon’s heart, and at once understands the language of birds.",
    "So does Siegfried of Germanic romance.",
    "The birds know the secrets of the gods.",
    "They are themselves forms of the gods.",
    "Apollonius of Tyana acquired wisdom by eating the hearts of dragons in Arabia.",
    "In ancient Egypt the heart was not only the seat of life, but the mind, and therefore the source of “words of power”.",
    "The Hebrews and many other peoples used “heart” when they wrote of “mind”.",
    "[132] Ptah, god of Memphis, was the “heart” (mind) of the gods.",
    "The “heart” fashioned the gods.",
    "Everything that is came into existence by the thought of the “heart” (mind).",
    "The Egyptian belief about the power of the “heart” (the source of magic knowledge, and healing, and creative power) lies behind the stories regarding heroes eating dragons’ hearts.",
    "In an Egyptian folk-tale the dragon-slayer does not eat the heart of the reptile god, but gets possession of a book of spells, and, on reading these, acquires knowledge of the languages of all animals, including fish and birds.",
    "[133] When, however, we investigate the dragon beliefs of ancient Babylonia, we meet with a reference to the Ku-pu as the source of divine power and wisdom.",
    "After Merodach (Marduk) the dragon-slayer kills Tiamat, the “mother dragon”, a form of the mother-goddess, he “divides the flesh of the Ku-pu, and devises a cunning plan”.",
    "As the late Mr. Leonard W. King pointed out, [134] Ku-pu is a word of uncertain meaning.",
    "It did not signify the heart, because it had been previously stated in the text that Merodach severed her inward parts, he pierced her heart.",
    "Jensen has suggested that Ku-pu signifies “trunk, body”.",
    "It is more probable that the Ku-pu was the seat of the soul, mind, and magical power; the power that enabled the slain reptile to come to life again in another form.",
    "[135] It may be that a clue is afforded in this connection by the Polynesian idea of Kupua.",
    "Mr. Westervelt, who has carefully recorded what he has found, writes regarding the Mo-o (dragons) of the Hawaiians: “Mighty eels, immense sea turtles, large fish of the ocean, fierce sharks, were all called mo-o. The most ancient dragons of the Hawaiians are spoken of as living in pools or lakes.",
    "These dragons were known also as Kupuas, or mysterious characters, who could appear as animals, or human beings, according to their wish.",
    "The saying was, ‘Kupuas have a strange double body!’”",
    "The Polynesian beliefs connected with the Kupuas are highly suggestive.",
    "Mr. Westervelt continues: “It was sometimes thought that at birth another natural form was added, such as an egg of a fowl or a bird, or the seed of a plant, or the embryo of some animal which, when fully developed, made a form which could be used as readily as the human body.",
    "These Kupuas were always given some great magic power.",
    "They were wonderfully strong, and wise, and skilful.",
    "“Usually the birth of a Kupua, like the birth of a high chief, was attended with strange disturbances in the heavens, such as reverberating thunder, flashing lightning, and severe storms which sent the abundant red soil of the islands down the mountain-sides in blood-red torrents, known as ka-ua-koko (the blood rain).",
    "The name was also given to misty, fine rain when shot through by the red waves of the sun.”",
    "All the dragons of Hawaii were descended from Mo-o-inanea (the self-reliant dragon), a mother-goddess.",
    "She had a dual nature, “sometimes appearing as a dragon, sometimes as a woman”.",
    "Hawaiian dragons also assumed the forms of large stones, some of which were associated with groves of hau trees; on these stones ferns and flowers were laid and referred to as “kupuas”.",
    "[136] In China the dragon’s kupua (to use the Polynesian term) figures in various stories.",
    "We meet with the “Red Cloud herb”, or the “Dragon Cloud herb”, which cures diseases.",
    "It is the gift of the dragon, and apparently a dragon kupua.",
    "Other curative herbs are the “dragon-whisker’s herb” and the “dragon’s liver”, a species of gentian, which is in Japan a badge of the Minamoto family.",
    "The “dragon’s spittle” had curative qualities, the essence of life being in the body moisture of a deity.",
    "The pearl, which the dragon spits out, has, or is, “soul substance”.",
    "The plum tree was in China connected with the dragon.",
    "A story tells that once a dragon was punished by having its ears cut off.",
    "Its blood fell on the ground, and a plum tree sprang up; it bore fleshy fruit without kernels.",
    "[137] When in an ancient Egyptian story the blood of the Bata bull falls to the ground two trees containing his soul-forms grow in a night.",
    "[138] A Chinese “Boy Blue” story deals with the search made by Wang Shuh, a herbalist, for the Red Cloud herb.",
    "He followed the course of a mountain stream on a hot summer day, and at noon sat down to rest and eat rice below shady trees beside the deep pool of a waterfall.",
    "As he lay on the bank, gazing into the water, he was astonished to see in its depths a blue boy, about a foot in height, with a blue rush in his hand, riding on the back of a red carp, without disturbing the fish, which darted hither and thither.",
    "In time the pair came to the surface, and, rising into the air, turned towards the east.",
    "Then they went swiftly in the direction of a bank of cloud that was creeping across the blue sky, and vanished from sight.",
    "The herbalist continued to ascend the mountain, searching for the herb, and when he reached the summit was surprised to find that the sky had become completely overcast.",
    "Great masses of black and yellow clouds had risen over the Eastern Sea, and a thunder-storm was threatening.",
    "Wang Shuh then realized that the blue boy he had seen riding on the back of the red carp was no other than the thunder-dragon.",
    "He peered at the clouds, and perceived that the boy and the carp [139] had been transformed into a black kiao (scaled dragon).",
    "He was greatly alarmed, and concealed himself in a hollow tree.",
    "Soon the storm burst forth in all its fury.",
    "The herbalist trembled to hear the voice of the black thunder-dragon and to catch glimpses of his fiery tongue as he spat out flashes of lightning.",
    "Rain fell in torrents, and the mountain stream was heavily swollen, and roared down the steep valley.",
    "Wang Shuh feared that each moment would be his last.",
    "In time, however, the storm ceased and the sky cleared.",
    "Wang Shuh then crept forth from his hiding-place, thankful to be still alive, although he had seen the dragon.",
    "He at once set out to return by the way he had come.",
    "When he drew near to the waterfall he was greatly astonished to hear the sound of sweet humming music.",
    "Peering through the branches of the trees, he beheld the little blue boy riding on the back of the red carp, returning from the east and settling down on the surface of the pool.",
    "Soon the boy was carried into the depths and past the playful fish again.",
    "Struck with fear, the herbalist was for a time unable to move.",
    "When at length he had summoned sufficient strength and courage to go forward, he found that the boy and the carp had vanished completely.",
    "Then he perceived that the Red Cloud herb, for which he had been searching, had sprung up on the very edge of the swirling water.",
    "Stooping, he plucked it greedily.",
    "As soon as he had done so, he went scampering down the side of the mountain.",
    "On reaching the village, Wang told his friends the wonderful story of his adventure and discovery.",
    "Now it happened that the Emperor’s daughter—a very beautiful girl—was lying ill in the royal palace.",
    "The Court physicians had endeavoured in vain to restore her to health.",
    "Hearing of Wang Shuh’s discovery of the Red Cloud herb, the Emperor sent out for him.",
    "On reaching the palace, the herbalist was addressed by the Emperor himself, who said: “Is it true, as men tell, that you have seen the black kiao in the form of a little blue boy riding on a red carp?”",
    "“It is indeed true,” Wang Shuh made answer.",
    "“And is it true that you have found the dragon herb that sprang up during the thunder-storm?”",
    "“I have brought the herb with me, Your Majesty.”",
    "“Mayhap,” the Emperor said, “it will give healing to my daughter.”",
    "Wang Shuh at once made offer of the herb, and the Emperor led him to the room in which the sick princess lay.",
    "The herb had a sweet odour, [140] and Wang Shuh plucked a leaf and gave it to the lady to smell.",
    "She at once showed signs of reviving, and this was regarded as a good omen.",
    "Wang Shuh then made a medicine from the herb, and when the princess had partaken of it, she grew well and strong again.",
    "The Emperor rewarded Wang Shuh by appointing him his chief physician.",
    "Thus the herbalist became a great and influential man.",
    "To few mortals comes the privilege of setting eyes on a dragon, and to fewer is the vision followed by good fortune.",
    "In this quaint story the Red Cloud herb is evidently a kupua of the thunder-dragon.",
    "It had “soul substance” (the vital essence).",
    "Another kupua or avatar was the carp.",
    "In China and Japan there are references in dragon stories to pine trees being forms assumed by dragons.",
    "The connection between the tree and dragon is emphasized by the explanation that when a pine becomes very old it is covered with scales of bark, and ultimately changes into a dragon.",
    "By night “dragon lanterns” (ignis fatuus) are seen on pine trees in marshy places, and on the masts of ships at sea.",
    "The pine trees at Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines are said to be regularly illuminated by these “supernatural” lights.",

    "The priest had his curiosity satisfied, but apparently without coming to harm.",
    "Priestly prestige was maintained by stories of this kind.",
    "As soon as the priest looked in her face the dragon woman rose in the air, and stretched out the small finger of her right hand.",
    "It was not, however, of human shape, but a claw that suddenly extended a great length and flashed lights of five colours.",
    "The “five colours” indicate that the woman was a deity.",
    "Kwan Chung, in his work Kwantsze, says: “A dragon in the water covers himself with five colours.",

    "And when Maui saw she had drawn out her nail to produce fire for him, he thought it a most wonderful thing.”",
    "[142] The reference in the Japanese story to the averted face of the dragon woman may be connected with the ancient belief that the mortal who looked in the face of a deity was either shrivelled up or transformed into stone, as happened in the case of those who fixed their eyes upon the face of Medusa.",
    "Goddesses like the Egyptian Neith were “veiled”.",

    "Food was brought, and when the meal was finished, the youth thanked him for his hospitality and walked across the courtyard.",
    "Wu noticed that before one of the servants passed through the gate, he turned the umbrella upside down.",
    "When the youth had mounted his horse, he turned to the silent, observant boy and said: “I shall come again to-morrow.”",
    "Wu bowed and answered: “Come!”",
    "The strangers rode away, and Wu sat watching them until they had vanished from sight.",
    "When evening came on, the farmer spoke to his son regarding the visitors, and said: “The noble youth knew my name and yet I have never set eyes on him before.”",
    "Wu was silent for a time.",
    "Then he said: “I cannot say who the youth is or who his attendants are.”",
    "“You watched them very closely, my son.",
    "Did you note anything peculiar about them?”",
    "Said Wu: “There were no seams in their clothing; the white horse had spots of five colours and scaly armour instead of hair.",
    "The hoofs of the horse and the feet of the strangers did not touch the ground.”",
    "[147] Yin rose up with agitation and exclaimed: “Then they are not human beings, but spirits.”",
    "Said Wu: “I watched them as they went westward.",
    "Rain-clouds were gathering on the horizon, and when they were a great distance off they all rose in the air and vanished in the clouds.”",
    "[148] Yin was greatly alarmed to hear this, and said: “I must ask your grandmother what she thinks of this strange happening.”",
    "The old woman was fast asleep, and as she had grown very deaf it was difficult to awaken her.",
    "When at length she was thoroughly roused, and sat up with head and hands trembling with palsy, [149] Yin repeated to her in a loud voice all that Wu had told him.",
    "Said the woman: “The horse, spotted with five colours, and with scaly armour instead of hair, is a dragon-horse.",
    "When spirits appear before human beings they wear magic garments.",
    "That is why the clothing of your visitors had no seams.",
    "Spirits tread on air.",
    "As these spirits went westward, they rose higher and higher in the air, going towards the rain-clouds.",
    "The youth was the Yellow Dragon.",
    "He is to raise a storm, and as he had four followers, the storm will be a great one.",
    "May no evil befall us.”",
    "Then Yin told the old woman that one of the strangers had turned the umbrella upside down before passing through the garden gate.",
    "“That is a good omen,” she said.",
    "Then she lay down and closed her eyes.",
    "“I have need of sleep,” she murmured; “I am very old.”",
    "[150] Heavy masses of clouds were by this time gathering in the sky, and Yin decided to sit up all night.",
    "Wu asked to be permitted to do the same, and his father consented.",
    "Then the boy lit a yellow lantern, put on a yellow robe that his grandmother had made for him, burned incense, and sat down reading charms from an old yellow book.",
    "[151] The storm burst forth in fury just when dawn was breaking dimly.",
    "Wu then closed his yellow book and went to a window.",
    "The thunder bellowed, the lightning flamed, and the rain fell in torrents, and swollen streams poured down from the mountains.",
    "Soon the river rose in flood and swept across the fields.",
    "Cattle gathered in groups on shrinking mounds that had become islands surrounded by raging water.",
    "Yin feared greatly that the house would be swept away, and wished he had fled to the mountains.",
    "At night the cottage was entirely surrounded by the flood.",
    "Trees were cast down and swept away.",
    "“We cannot escape now,” groaned Yin.",
    "Wu sat in silence, displaying no signs of emotion.",
    "“What do you think of it all?”",
    "his father asked.",
    "Wu reminded him that one of the strangers had turned the umbrella upside down, and added: “Before the dragon youth went away he spoke and said: ‘I shall come again to-morrow’.”",
    "“He has come indeed,” Yin groaned, and covered his face with his hands.",
    "Said Wu: “I have just seen the dragon.",
    "As I looked towards the sky he spread out his great hood above our home.",
    "He is protecting us now.”",
    "“Alas!",
    "my son, you are dreaming.”",
    "“Listen, father, no rain falls on the roof.”",
    "Yin listened intently.",
    "Then he said: “You speak truly, my son.",
    "This is indeed a great marvel.”",
    "“It was well,” said Wu, “that you welcomed the dragon yesterday.”",
    "“He spoke to you first, my son; and you answered, ‘Enter’.",
    "Ah, you have much wisdom.",
    "You will become a great man.”",
    "The storm began to subside, and Wu prevailed upon his father to lie down and sleep.",
    "[152] Much damage had been done by storm and flood, and large numbers of human beings and domesticated animals had perished.",
    "In the village, which was situated at the mouth of the valley, only a few houses were left standing.",
    "The rain ceased to fall at midday.",
    "Then the sun came out and shone brightly, while the waters began to retreat.",
    "Wu went outside and sat at the garden gate, as was his custom.",
    "In time he saw the yellow youth returning from the west, accompanied by his four attendants.",
    "When he came nigh, Wu bowed and the youth drew up his horse and spoke, saying: “I said I should return to-day.”",
    "Wu bowed.",
    "“But this time I shall not enter the courtyard,” the youth added.",
    "“As you will,” Wu said reverently.",
    "The dragon youth then handed the boy a single scale which he had taken from the horse’s neck, and said: “Keep this and I shall remember you.”",
    "Then he rode away and vanished from sight.",
    "The boy re-entered the house.",
    "He awoke his father and said: “The storm is over and the dragon has returned to his pool.”",
    "[153] Yin embraced his son, and together they went to inform the old woman.",
    "She awoke, sat up, and listened to all that was said to her.",
    "When she learned that the dragon youth had again appeared and had spoken to Wu, she asked: “Did he give you ought before he departed?”",
    "Wu opened a small wooden box and showed her the scale that had been taken from the neck of the dragon horse.",
    "The woman was well pleased, and said: “When the Emperor sends for you, all will be well.”",
    "Yin was astonished to hear these words, and exclaimed: “Why should the Emperor send for my boy?”",
    "“You shall see,” the old woman made answer as she lay down again.",
    "Before long the Emperor heard of the great marvel that had been worked in the flooded valley.",
    "Men who had taken refuge on the mountains had observed that no rain fell on Yin’s house during the storm.",
    "So His Majesty sent couriers to the valley, and these bade Yin to accompany them to the palace, taking Wu with him.",
    "On being brought before the Emperor, Yin related everything that had taken place.",
    "Then His Majesty asked to see the scale of the dragon horse.",
    "It was growing dusk when Wu opened the box, and the scale shone so brightly that it illumined the throne-room so that it became as bright as at high noon.",
    "Said the Emperor: “Wu shall remain here and become one of my magicians.",
    "The yellow dragon has imparted to him much power and wisdom.”",
    "Thus it came about that Wu attained high rank in the kingdom.",
    "He found that great miracles could be worked with the scale of the dragon horse.",
    "It cured disease, and it caused the Emperor’s army to win victories.",
    "Withal, Wu was able to foretell events, and he became a renowned prophet and magician.",
    "The farmer’s son grew to be very rich and powerful.",
    "A great house was erected for him close to the royal palace, and he took his grandmother and father to it, and there they lived happily until the end of their days.",
    "Thus did Wu, son of Yin, become a great man, because of the favour shown to him by the thunder-dragon, who had wrought great destruction in the river valley and taken toll of many lives.",
    "It will be gathered from this story that the Chinese dragon is not always a “beneficent deity”, as some writers put it.",
    "Like certain other gods, he is a destroyer and preserver in one.",

    "The palace of the dragon king is situated in the Underworld, which can be entered through a deep mountain cave or a dragon-guarded well.",
    "In some of the Chinese stories the dragon palace is located right below a remote island in the Eastern Sea.",
    "This island is not easily approached, for on the calmest of days great billows dash against its shelving crags.",
    "When the tide is high, it is entirely covered by water and hidden from sight.",
    "Junks may then pass it or even sail over it, without their crews being aware that they are nigh to the palace of the sea-god.",
    "Sometimes a red light burns above the island at night.",
    "It is seen many miles distant, and its vivid rays may be reflected in the heavens.",
    "In a Japanese story the island is referred to as “a glowing red mass resembling the rising sun”.",
    "No mariner dares to approach it.",
    "There was once a Chinese priest who, on a memorable night, reached the dragon king’s palace by entering a deep cave on a mountain-side.",
    "It was his pious desire to worship the dragon, and he went onward in the darkness, reciting religious texts that gave him protection.",
    "The way was long and dark and difficult, but at length, after travelling far, he saw a light in front of him.",
    "He walked towards this light and emerged from the cavern to find that he was in the Underworld.",
    "Above him was a clear blue firmament lit by the night sun.",
    "He beheld a beautiful palace in the midst of a garden that glittered with gems and flowers, and directed his steps towards it.",
    "He reached a window the curtain of which rustled in the wind.",
    "He perceived that it was a mass of gleaming pearls.",
    "Peering behind it, as it moved, he beheld a table formed of jewels.",
    "On this table lay a book of Buddhist prayers (sutras).",
    "As he gazed with wonder and reverence, the priest heard a voice that spake and said: “Who hath come nigh and why hath he come?”",
    "The priest answered in a low voice, giving his name, and expressing his desire to behold the dragon king, whom he desired to worship.",
    "Then the voice made answer: “Here no human eye can look upon me.",
    "Return by the way thou hast come, and I shall appear before thee at a distance from the cavern mouth.”",
    "The priest made obeisance, and returned to the world of men by the way he had come.",
    "He went to the spot that the voice had indicated, and there he waited, reading sacred texts.",
    "Soon the earth yawned and the dragon king arose in human shape, wearing a red hat and garment.",
    "The priest worshipped him, and then the dragon vanished from sight.",
    "On that sacred spot a temple was afterwards erected.",
    "Once upon a time the daughter of the dragon king, who was named “Abundant Pearl Princess”, fell in love with a comely youth of Japan.",
    "He was sitting, on a calm summer day, beneath a holy tree, and his image was reflected in a dragon well.",
    "The princess appeared before him and cast a love spell over his heart.",
    "The youth was enchanted by her beauty, and she led him towards the palace of the dragon king, the “Abundant Pearl Prince”.",
    "There she married him, and they lived together for three years.",
    "Then the youth was possessed by a desire to return to the world of men.",
    "In vain the princess pleaded with him to remain in the palace.",
    "When, however, she found that his heart was set on leaving the kingdom of the Underworld, she resolved to accompany him.",
    "He was conveyed across the sea on the back of a wani (a dragon in crocodile shape).",
    "The princess accompanied him, and he built a house for her on the seashore.",
    "The “Abundant Pearl Princess” was about to become a mother, and she made the youth promise not to look upon her until after her child was born.",
    "But he broke his vow.",
    "Overcome with curiosity, he peered into her chamber and saw that his wife had assumed the shape of a dragon.",
    "As soon as the child was born, the princess departed in anger and was never again beheld by her husband.",
    "This story, it will be noted, is another Far-Eastern version of the Melusina legend.",
    "An Indian version of the tale relates that the hero was a sailor, the sole survivor from a wreck, who swam to a small island in the midst of the sea.",
    "When he reached the shore, he set out to look for food, but found that the trees and shrubs, which dazzled him with their beauty, bore beautiful gems instead of fruit.",
    "At length, however, he found a fruit-bearing tree.",
    "He ate and was well content.",
    "Then he sat down beside a well.",
    "As he stooped to drink of its waters, he had a vision of the Underworld in all its beauty.",
    "At the bottom of the well sat a fair sea-maid, who looked upwards with eyes of love and beckoned him towards her.",
    "He plunged into the well and found himself in the radiant Kingdom of Ocean.",
    "The maid was the queen, and she took him as her consort.",
    "She promised him great wealth, but forbade him to touch the statue of an Apsara",
    "[154], which was of gold and adorned with gems.",
    "But one day he placed his hand on the right foot of the image.",
    "The foot darted forth and struck him with such force that he was driven through the sea and washed ashore on his native coast.",
    "[155] The oldest version of this type of story comes from Egypt.",
    "It has been preserved in a papyrus in the Hermitage collection at Petrograd, and is usually referred to as of Twelfth Dynasty origin (c. 2000 B.C.).",
    "A sailor relates that he was the sole survivor from a wreck.",
    "He had seized a piece of wood and swam to an island.",
    "After he recovered from exhaustion, he set out to search for food.",
    "“I found there figs and grapes, all manner of good herbs, berries and grain, melons of all kinds, fishes and birds.”",
    "In time, he heard a noise “as of thunder”, while “the trees shook and the earth was moved”.",
    "The ruler of the island drew nigh.",
    "He was a human-headed serpent “thirty cubits long, and his beard greater than two cubits; his body was as overlaid with gold, and his colour as that of true lapis-lazuli”.",
    "The story proceeds to tell that the sailor becomes the guest of the serpent, who makes speeches to him and introduces him to his family.",
    "It is stated that the island “has risen from the waves and will sink again”.",
    "After a time the sailor is rescued by a passing vessel.",
    "[156] This ancient Egyptian tale links with the Indian and Chinese versions given above.",
    "The blue serpent resembles closely the Chinese dragon; the vanishing island is common to Egypt and China.",
    "Like much else that came from Egypt, the island has a history.",
    "Long before the ancient mariners transferred it to the ocean, it figured in the fused mythology of the Solar and Osirian cults.",
    "Horus hid from Set on a green floating island on the Nile.",
    "He was protected by a serpent deity.",
    "His father, Osiris, is Judge and Ruler of the Underworld, and has a serpent shape as the Nile god and the dragon of the abyss.",
    "The red light associated with the Chinese dragon island of ocean recalls the Red Horus, a form of the sun-god, rising from the Nile of the Underworld, on which floated the green nocturnal sun, “the green bed of Horus” and a form of his father Osiris as the solar deity of night.",
    "The Osirian underworld idea appears to have given origin to the widespread stories found as far apart as Japan and the British Isles regarding “Land-under-Waves” and “the Kingdom of the Sea”.",
    "The green floating island of Paradise is referred to in Scottish Gaelic folk-tales.",
    "In Fiji the natives tell of a floating island that vanishes when men approach it.",
    "[157] In some Chinese legends Egyptian conceptions blend with those of Babylonia.",
    "The Chinese priest who, in the dragon-king story, reached the Underworld through a deep cave, followed in the footsteps of Gilgamesh, who went in search of the “Plant of Life”—the herb that causes man “to renew his youth like the eagle”.",
    "[158] Gilgamesh entered the cave of the Mountain of Mashi (Sunset Hill), and after passing through its night-black depths, reached the seaside garden in which, as on the island in the Indian story, the trees bore, instead of fruit and flowers, clusters of precious stones.",
    "He beheld in the midst of this garden of dazzling splendour the palace of Sabitu, the goddess, who instructed him how to reach the island on which lived his ancestor Pir-naphishtum (Ut-napishtim).",
    "Gilgamesh was originally a god, the earlier Gishbilgames of Sumerian texts.",
    "[159] The Indian Hanuman (the monkey-god) similarly enters a deep cave when he goes forth as a spy to Lanka, the dwelling-place of Ravana, the demon who carried away Sita, wife of Rama, the hero of the Rámáyana.",
    "A similar story is told in the mythical history of Alexander the Great.",
    "There are also western European legends of like character.",
    "Hercules searches for the golden apples that grow in the Hesperian gardens.",
    "[160] In some Far Eastern stories the hero searches for a sword instead of an herb.",
    "“Every weapon,” declares an old Gaelic saying, “has its demon.”",
    "The same belief prevailed in China, where dragons sometimes appeared in the form of weapons, and in India, where the spirits of celestial weapons appeared before heroes like Arjuna and Rama.",
    "[161] In the Teutonic Balder story, as related by Saxo Grammaticus, [162] the hero is slain by a sword taken from the Underworld, where it was kept by Miming (Mimer), the god, in an Underworld cave.",
    "Hother, who gains possession of it, goes by a road “hard for mortal man to travel”.",
    "In the Norse version the sword becomes an herb—the mistletoe, a “cure-all”, like the Chinese dragon herb and the Babylonian “Plant of Life”.",
    "Excalibur, the sword of King Arthur, was obtained from the lake-goddess (a British “Naga”), and was flung back into the lake before he died: So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur: But ere he dipped the surface, rose an arm Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him Three times, and drew him under in the mere.",
    "[163] The Japanese story of the famous Kusanagi sword is a Far-Eastern link between the Celestial herb- and weapon-legends of Asia and Europe.",
    "It tells that this magic sword was one of the three treasures possessed by the imperial family of Japan, and that the warrior who wielded it could put to flight an entire army.",
    "At a naval battle the sword was worn by the boy-Emperor, Antoku Tennō.",
    "He was unable to make use of it, and when the enemy were seen to be victorious, the boy’s grandmother, Nu-no-ama, clutched him in her arms and leapt into the sea.",
    "Many long years afterwards, when the Emperor Go Shirakawa sat on the imperial throne, his barbarian enemies declared war against him.",
    "The Emperor arose in his wrath and called for the Kusanagi sword.",
    "Search was made for it in the temple of Kamo, where it was supposed to be in safe-keeping.",
    "The Emperor was told, however, that it had been lost, and he gave orders that ceremonies should be performed with purpose to discover where the sword was, and how it might be restored.",
    "One night, soon afterwards, the Emperor dreamed a dream, in which a royal lady, who had been dead for centuries, appeared before him and told that the Kusanagi sword was in the keeping of the dragon king in his palace at the bottom of the sea.",
    "Next morning the Emperor related his dream to his chief minister, and bade him hasten to the two female divers, Oimatsu and her daughter Wakamatsu, who resided at Dan-no-ura, so that they might dive to the bottom of the sea and obtain the sword.",
    "The divers undertook the task, and were conveyed in a boat to that part of the ocean where the boy-Emperor, Antoku Tennō, had been drowned.",
    "A religious ceremony was performed, and the mother and daughter then dived into the sea.",
    "A whole day passed before they appeared again.",
    "They told, as soon as they were taken into the boat, that they had visited a wonderful city at the bottom of the sea.",
    "Its gates were guarded by silent sentinels who drew flashing swords when they (the divers) attempted to enter.",
    "They were consequently compelled to wait for several hours, until a holy man appeared and asked them what they sought.",
    "When they had informed him that they were searching for the Kusanagi sword, he said that the city could not be entered without the aid of Buddha.",
    "Said the Emperor’s chief minister: “The city is that of the god of the sea.”",
    "“It is very beautiful,” Oimatsu told him; “the walls are of gold, and the gates of pearl.",
    "Above the city walls are seen many-coloured towers that gleam like to precious stones.",
    "When one of the gates was opened, we perceived that the streets were of silver and the houses of mother-of-pearl.”",
    "Said the Emperor’s chief minister: “Fain would I visit that city.”",
    "He looked over the side of the boat and sighed, “I see naught but darkness.”",
    "“When we dived and reached the sea-bottom,” Oimatsu continued, “we beheld a cave and entered it.",
    "Thick darkness prevailed, but we walked on and on, groping as we went, until we reached a beautiful plain over which bends the sky, blue as sapphire.",
    "Trees growing on the plain bear clusters of dazzling gems that sparkle among their leaves.”",
    "“Were you not tempted to pluck them?” asked the minister.",
    "“Each tree is guarded by a poisonous snake,” Oimatsu told him, “and we dared not touch the gems.”",
    "On the following day the divers were provided with sutra-charms by the chief priest of the temple of Kamo.",
    "They entered the sea again, and told, on their return next morning, that they had visited the city, and reached the palace of the dragon king, which was guarded by invisible sentries.",
    "Two women came out of the palace and bade them stand below an old pine tree, the bark of which glittered like the scales of a dragon.",
    "In front of them was a window.",
    "The blind was made of beautiful pearls, and was raised high enough to permit them to see right into the room.",
    "One of the palace ladies said, “Look through the window.”",
    "The women looked.",
    "In the room they saw a mighty serpent with a sword in his mouth.",
    "He had eyes bright as the sun, and a blood-red tongue.",
    "In his coils lay a little boy fast asleep.",
    "[164] The serpent looked round and, addressing the women, spoke and said: “You have come hither to obtain the Kusanagi sword, but I shall keep it for ever.",
    "It does not belong to the Emperor of Japan.",
    "Many years ago it was taken from this palace by a dragon prince who went to dwell in the river",
    "Hi.",
    "He was slain by a hero of Japan.",
    "[165] This hero carried off the sword and presented it to the Emperor.",
    "After many years had gone past a sea-dragon took the form of a princess.",
    "She became the bride of a prince of Japan, and was the grandmother of the boy-Emperor with whom she leapt into the sea during the battle of Dan-no-ura.",
    "This boy now lies asleep in my coils.”",
    "The Emperor of Japan sorrowed greatly when he was informed regarding the dragon king’s message.",
    "“Alas!”",
    "he said, “if the Kusanagi sword cannot be obtained, the barbarians will defeat my army in battle.”",
    "Then a magician told the Emperor that he knew of a powerful spell that would compel the dragon to give up the sword.",
    "“If it is successful,” the Emperor said, “I shall elevate you to the rank of a prince.”",
    "The spell was worked, and when next the female divers went to the Kingdom under the Sea, they obtained the sword, with which they returned to the Emperor.",
    "He used it in battle and won a great victory.",
    "The sword was afterwards placed in a box and deposited in the temple of Atsuta, and there it remained for many years, until a Korean priest carried it away.",
    "When, however, the Korean was crossing the ocean to his own land, a great storm arose.",
    "The captain of the vessel knew it was no ordinary storm, but one that had been raised by a god, and he spoke and said, “Who on board this ship has offended the dragon king of Ocean?”",
    "Then said the Korean priest, “I shall throw my sword into the sea as a peace-offering.”",
    "He did as he said he would, and immediately the storm passed away.",
    "The dragon king caused the sword to be replaced in the temple from which the Korean had stolen it.",
    "There it lay for a century.",
    "Then it was carried back to the palace of the dragon-god in his Kingdom under the Sea.",
    "Magic or supernatural swords were possessed by the spirits of dragon-gods.",
    "According to a Chinese story in the Books of the Tsin Dynasty, an astrologer once discovered that among the stars there shone the spirits of two magic swords, and that they were situated right above the spot where the swords had, in time past, been concealed.",
    "Search was made for these, and deep down in the earth was found a luminous stone chest.",
    "Inside the chest lay two swords that bore inscriptions indicating that they were dragon swords.",
    "As soon as they were taken out of the box, their star-spirits faded from the sky.",
    "These dragon swords could not be retained by human beings for any prolonged period.",
    "Stories are told of swords being taken away by spirit-beings and even of swords leaping of their own accord from their sheaths into rivers or the ocean, and assuming dragon shape as soon as they touched water.",
    "[166] Similarly dragon jewels might be carried away by dragons who appeared in human shape—either as beautiful girls or as crafty old men.",
    "It was fortunate for mortals when dragons appeared as human beings, as animals, or as fish that spoke with human voices.",
    "Dragons were unable to change their shapes when angry, or when they intended to avenge a wrong.",
    "A transformed dragon was therefore quite harmless.",

    "The Chinese and Japanese, like the Egyptians, Indians, Fijians, and others, believed, as has been shown, in the existence of a floating and vanishing island associated with the serpent-god or dragon-god of ocean.",
    "They believed, too, that somewhere in the Eastern Sea lay a group of islands that were difficult to locate or reach; which resembled closely, in essential particulars, the “Islands of the Blest”, or “Fortunate Isles”, of ancient Greek writers.",
    "Vague beliefs regarding fabulous countries far across the ocean were likewise prevalent.",
    "In some native accounts these Chinese Islands of the Blest are said to be five in number, and named Tai Yü, Yüan Chiao, Fang Hu, Ying Chou, and P’ēng-lai; in others the number is nine, or ten, or only three.",
    "A single island is sometimes referred to; it may be located in the ocean, or in the Yellow River, or in the river of the Milky Way, the Celestial Ho.",
    "The islands are, in Chinese legend, reputed to be inhabited by those who have won immortality, or by those who have been transported to their Paradise to dwell there in bliss for a prolonged period so that they may be reborn on earth, or pass to a higher state of existence.",
    "It is of special interest to note in connection with these islands that they have Wells of Life and Trees or Herbs of Life.",
    "The souls drink the water and eat the herb or fruit of the tree to prolong their existence.",
    "One Chinese “plant of life” is li chih, “the fungus of immortality”.",
    "It appears on Chinese jade ornaments as a symbol of longevity.",
    "“This fungus”, writes Laufer, “is a species of Agaric and considered a felicitous plant, because it absorbs the vapours of the earth.",
    "In the Li Ki (ed. Couvreur, Vol.",
    "I, p. 643)",
    "it is mentioned as an edible plant.",
    "As a marvellous plant foreboding good luck, it first appeared under the Han Dynasty, in 109 B.C., when it sprouted in the imperial palace Kan-tsʼüan.",
    "The emperor issued an edict announcing this phenomenon, and proclaimed an amnesty in the empire except for relapsing criminals.",
    "A hymn in honour of this divine plant was composed in the same year.”",
    "[167] Like the Red Cloud herb the li chih had evidently a close connection with the dragon-god.",
    "The question arises whether the idea of an island of paradise was of “spontaneous origin” in China, or whether the ancient Chinese borrowed the belief from intruders, or from peoples with whom they had constant trading relations.",
    "There is evidence that as far back as the fourth century B.C., a Chinese explorer set out on an expedition to search for the island or islands of Paradise in the Eastern Sea.",
    "But it is not known at what precise period belief in the island arose and became prevalent.",
    "The evidence afforded by the ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts is of special interest and importance in connection with the problem of origin.",
    "As far back as c. 2500 B.C.",
    "“the departed Pharaoh hoped to draw his sustenance in the realm of Re (Paradise)” from “the tree of life in the mysterious isle in the midst of the Field of Offerings”.",
    "The soul of the Pharaoh, according to the Pyramid Texts, set out, soon after death, in search of this island “in company with the Morning Star.",
    "The Morning Star is a gorgeous green falcon, a solar divinity, identified with Horus of Dewat.”",
    "The Egyptian story of the soul’s quest goes on to tell that “this King Pepi ... went to the great isle in the midst of the Field of Offerings over which the gods make the swallows fly.",
    "The swallows are the Imperishable Stars.",
    "They give to this King Pepi the tree of life, whereof they live, that ye (Pepi and the Morning Star) may at the same time live thereof.”",
    "(Pyramid Texts, 1209–16).",
    "Sinister enemies “may contrive to deprive the king of the sustenance provided for him....”",
    "Charms were provided to protect the fruit of immortality.",
    "“The enemy against which these are most often directed in the Pyramid Texts is serpents.”",
    "In the Japanese story of the Kusanagi sword, the gem-trees of the Otherworld are protected by dragons.",
    "The Pyramid Texts devoted to the ancient Egyptian King Unis tell that a divine voice cries to the gods Re and Thoth (sun and moon), saying, “Take ye this King Unis with you that he may eat of that which ye eat, and that he may drink of that which ye drink.”",
    "The magic well is referred to as “the pool of King Unis”.",
    "[168] The soul of the Pharaoh also sails with the unwearied stars in the barque of the sun-god, not only by day but by night, and as the Egyptian night sun was green, “the green bed of Horus”, the idea of the floating solar island on the Underworld Nile became fused with that of the island with the Well of Life and the Tree of Life.",
    "In the Pyramid Texts the Celestial Otherworld “is”, as Breasted says, “not only the east, but explicitly the east of the sky”.",
    "[169] Similarly the fabulous continents of the Chinese were situated to the east of the mythical sea.",
    "The Sumerians and early Babylonians had, like the Egyptians, their Islands of the Blest.",
    "Gilgamesh, who reaches these islands by crossing the mythical sea, finds dwelling on one of them Ut-napishtim (the Babylonian Noah) and his wife.",
    "Ut-napishtim directs the hero to another island on which there is a fountain of healing waters and a magic plant that renews youth.",
    "Gilgamesh finds the Plant of Immortality, but as he stoops to drink water from a stream, a serpent darts forth and snatches the plant from him.",
    "This serpent was a form of “the Earth Lion” (the dragon).",
    "[170] The Gilgamesh legend dates back beyond 2500 B.C. Like the Egyptian one enshrined in the Pyramid Texts, it has two main features, the Well of Life and the Tree or Plant of Life, which are situated on an island.",
    "The island in time crept into the folk-tales.",
    "It was no doubt the prototype of the vanishing island of the Egyptian mariner’s story already referred to.",
    "In the Shih Chi (Historical Record) of Ssŭ-ma Chʼien, “the Herodotus of China”, a considerable part of which has been translated by Professor Ed.",
    "Chavannes, [171] the three Chinese Islands of the Blest (San, Shen, Shan) are named P’ēng-lai, Fang Chang, and Ying Chou.",
    "They are located in the Gulf of Chihli, but are difficult to reach because contrary winds spring up and drive vessels away in the same manner as the vessel of Odysseus was driven away from Ithaca.",
    "It is told, however, that in days of old certain fortunate heroes contrived to reach and visit the fabled isles.",
    "They told that they saw there palaces of gold and silver, that the white men and women, the white beasts and the white birds ate the Herb of Life and drank the waters of the Fountain of Life.",
    "On the island of Ying Chou are great precipices of jade.",
    "A brook, the waters of which are as stimulating as wine, flows out of a jade rock.",
    "Those who can reach the island and drink of this water will increase the length of their lives.",
    "When the jade water is mixed with pounded “fungus of immortality” a food is provided which ensures a thousand years of existence in the body.",
    "Chinese legends tell that the lucky mariners who come within view of the Isles of the Blest, behold them but dimly, as they seem to be enveloped in luminous clouds.",
    "When vessels approach too closely, the islands vanish by sinking below the waves, as do the fabled islands of Gaelic stories.",
    "Lieh Tze, alleged to be an early Taoist writer, [172] but whose writings, or those writings attributed to him, were forged in the first or second century A.D., has located the islands to the east of the gulf of Chihli in that fathomless abyss into which flow all the streams of the earth and the river of the Milky Way.",
    "Apparently this abyss is the Mythical Sea which was located beyond the eastern horizon—a part of the sea that surrounds the world.",
    "Into this sea or lake, according to the ancient Egyptian texts, pours the celestial river, along which sails the barque of the sun-god.",
    "The Nile was supposed by the Ancient Egyptians to be fed by the waters above the firmament and the waters below the earth.",
    "The Pyramid Texts, when referring to the birth of Osiris as “new water” (the inundation), say: The waters of life that are in the sky come; The waters of life that are in the earth come.",
    "The sky burns for thee, The earth trembles for thee.",
    "[173] In India the Ganges was likewise fed by the celestial Ganges that poured down from the sky.",
    "Lieh Tze’s Islands of the Blest are five in number, and are inhabited by the white souls of saintly sages who have won immortality by having their bodies rendered transparent, or after casting off their bodies as snakes cast off their skins.",
    "All the animals on these islands are likewise white and therefore pure and holy.",
    "The spirit-dwellings are of gold and jade, and in the groves and gardens the trees and plants bear pearls and precious stones.",
    "Those who eat of the fungus, or of perfumed fruit, renew their youth and acquire the power of floating like down through the air from island to island.",
    "At one time the islands drifted about on the tides of ocean, but the Lord of All who controls the Universe, having been appealed to by the Taoist sages who dwelt on the isles, caused three great Atlas-turtles to support each island with their heads so that they might remain steadfast.",
    "These turtles are relieved by others at the end of sixty thousand years.",
    "In like manner, in Indian mythology, the tortoise Kurma, an avatar of the god Vishnu, supports Mount Meru when it is placed in the Sea of Milk.",
    "The Japanese Creator has a tortoise form that supports the world-tree, on the summit of which sits a four-armed god.",
    "In China the tortoise had divine attributes.",
    "Tortoise shell is a symbol of unchangeability, and a symbol of rank when used for court girdles.",
    "The tortoise was also used for purposes of divination.",
    "[174] A gigantic mythical tortoise is supposed, in the Far East, to live in the depths of ocean.",
    "It has one eye situated in the middle of its body.",
    "Once every three thousand years it rises to the surface and turns over on its back so that it may see the sun.",
    "Once upon a time, a legend tells, the Atlas-turtles that support the Islands of the Blest suffered from a raid by a wandering giant.",
    "As the Indian god Vishnu and the Greek Poseidon could cross the Universe at three strides, so could this giant pass quickly from country to country and ocean to ocean.",
    "One or two strides were sufficient for him to reach the mythical ocean from the Lung-po mountains.",
    "He sat on the mountain summit of one of the Islands of the Blest, and cast his fishing-line into the deep waters.",
    "[175] The Atlas-turtles were unable to resist the lure of his bait and, having hooked and captured six of them, he threw them over his back and returned home in triumph.",
    "These turtles had been supporting the two islands, Tai Yü and Yüan Chiao, which, having been set free, were carried by powerful tides towards the north, where they stranded among the ice-fields.",
    "The white beings that inhabited these islands were thus separated from their fellow saints on the other three islands, Fang Hu, Ying Chou, and Pʼēng-lai.",
    "We are left to imagine how lonely they felt in isolation.",
    "No doubt, they suffered from the evils associated with the north—the “airt” of drought and darkness.",
    "The giant and his tribesmen were punished by the Lord of the Universe for this act by having their stature and their kingdom greatly reduced.",
    "On the fabled islands, the white saints cultivate and gather the “fungus of immortality”, as the souls in the Paradise of Osiris cultivate and harvest crops of barley and wheat and dates.",
    "Like the Osirian corn, the island fungus sprouts in great profusion.",
    "This fungus has not only the power to renew youth but even to restore the dead to life.",
    "The “Herodotus of China” has recorded that once upon a time leaves of the fungus were carried by ravens to the mainland from one of the islands, and dropped on the faces of warriors slain in battle.",
    "The warriors immediately came to life, although they had lain dead for three days.",
    "The “water of life” had similarly reanimating properties.",
    "The famous magician, Tung-fang Shuo, who lived in second century B.C., tells that the sacred islands are ten in number, there being two distinct groups of five.",
    "One of the distant islands is named Fu-sang, and it has been identified by different western writers with California, Mexico, Japan, and Formosa.",
    "Its name signifies “the Land of the Leaning Mulberry”.",
    "The mulberries are said to grow in pairs and to be of great height.",
    "Once every nine thousand years they bear fruit which the saints partake of.",
    "This fruit adds to their saintly qualities, and gives them power to soar skyward like celestial birds.",
    "Beyond Fu-sang is a country of white women who have hairy bodies.",
    "In the spring season they enter the river to bathe and become pregnant, and their children are born in the autumn.",
    "The hair of their heads is so long that it trails on the ground behind them.",
    "Instead of breasts, they have white locks or hairy organs at the back of their necks from which comes a liquor that nourishes their children.",
    "These women, according to some accounts, have no husbands, and take flight when they see a man.",
    "A historian who, by the way, gives them husbands, has recorded that a Chinese vessel was once driven by a tempest to this wonderful island.",
    "The crew landed and found that the women resembled those of China, but that the men had heads like dogs and voices that sounded like the barking of dogs.",
    "Evidently the legends about the fabled islands became mixed up with accounts of the distant islands of a bearded race reached by seafarers.",
    "There are records of several attempts that were made by pious Chinese Emperors to discover the Islands of the Blest, with purpose to obtain the “fungus of immortality”.",
    "One mariner named Hsu Fü, who was sent to explore the Eastern Sea so that the fungus might be brought to the royal palace, returned with a wonderful story.",
    "He said that a god had risen out of the sea and inquired if he was the Emperor’s representative.",
    "“I am,” the mariner made answer.",
    "“What seek ye?” asked the sea-god.",
    "“I am searching for the plant that has the power to prolong human life,” Hsu Fü answered.",
    "The god then informed the Emperor’s messenger that the offerings he brought were not sufficient to be regarded as payment for this magic plant.",
    "He was willing, however, that Hsu Fü should see the fungus for himself so that, apparently, the Emperor might be convinced it really existed.",
    "The vessel was then piloted in a south-easterly direction until the Islands of the Blest were reached.",
    "Hsu Fü was permitted to land on P’ēng-lai, the chief island, on which was situated the golden palace of the dragon king of ocean.",
    "There he saw newly-harvested crops of the “fungus of immortality” guarded by a great brazen dragon of ferocious aspect.",
    "Not a leaf could he obtain, however, to bring back to China.",
    "The pious mariner knelt before the sea-god and asked him what offering he required from the Emperor in return for the fungus.",
    "He was informed that many youths and girls would have to be sent to P’ēng-lai.",
    "On ascertaining the price demanded by the god for the magic fungus, the Emperor dispatched a fleet of vessels with three thousand young men and virgins.",
    "Hsu Fü was placed in command of the expedition.",
    "But he never returned again to China.",
    "According to some, he and his followers still reside on P’ēng-lai; others assert that he reached a distant land, supposed to be Japan, where he founded a state over which he reigned as king.",
    "Other Chinese Emperors were similarly anxious to discover the fabled islands, and many expeditions were sent to sea.",
    "One exasperated monarch is said to have had nearly five hundred magicians and scholars put to death because their efforts to assist him in discovering the islands had proved to be futile.",
    "Another Emperor fitted out a naval expedition which he himself commanded.",
    "Each vessel was packed with soldiers who in mid-ocean raised a great clamour, blowing horns, beating drums, and shouting in chorus, with purpose to terrify the gods of ocean and compel them to reveal the location of the Isle of Immortality.",
    "In time the dragon-god appeared in his fiercest shape, with the head of a lion and a shark-like body 500 feet in length.",
    "The Emperor ordered his fleet to surround the god, who had apparently come with the intention of preventing the ships going any farther.",
    "A fierce battle ensued.",
    "Thousands of poisoned arrows were discharged against the god, who was so grievously wounded that his blood tinged the sea over an area of 10,000 miles.",
    "But despite this victory achieved by mortals, the famous island on which grew the herb of immortality was never reached.",
    "On the same night the Emperor had to engage in single combat with the dragon-god, who came against him in a dream.",
    "This was a combat of souls, for in sleep, as was believed, the soul leaves the body.",
    "The soul of the Emperor fared badly.",
    "On the day that followed his majesty was unable to rise from his couch, and he died within the space of seven days.",
    "In Japanese stories the island of P’ēng-lai is referred to as Horaizan.",
    "It has three high mountains, on the chief of which, called Horai, grows the Tree of Life.",
    "This tree has a trunk and branches of gold, roots of silver, and gem-leaves and fruit.",
    "In some stories there are three trees, the peach, the plum, and the pine.",
    "The “fungus of immortality” is also referred to.",
    "It grows in the shade of one or another of the holy trees, usually the pine.",
    "There is evidence, too, of the belief that a “grass of immortality” grew on the sacred island as well as the famous fungus.",
    "The life-giving fountain was as well known to the Japanese as it was to the Chinese and others.",
    "A story is told of a Japanese Gilgamesh, named Sentaro, who, being afraid of death, summoned to his aid an immortal saint so that he might be enabled to obtain the “grass of immortality”.",
    "The saint handed him a crane made of paper which, when mounted, came to life and carried Sentaro across the ocean to Mount Horai.",
    "There he found and ate the life-giving grass.",
    "When, however, he had lived for a time on the island he became discontented.",
    "The other inhabitants had already grown weary of immortality and wished they could die.",
    "Sentaro himself began to pine for Japan and, in the end, resolved to mount his paper crane and fly over the sea.",
    "But after he left the island he doubted the wisdom of his impulsive resolution.",
    "The result was that the crane, which moved according to his will, began to crumple up and drop through the air.",
    "Sentaro was greatly scared, and once again yearned so deeply for his native land that the crane, straightened and strengthened by his yearning, rose into the air and continued its flight until Japan was reached.",
    "Another Japanese hero, named Wasobioye, the story of whose wanderings is retold by Professor Chamberlain, [176] once set out in a boat to escape troublesome visitors.",
    "The day was the eighth of the eighth month and the moon was full.",
    "Suddenly a storm came on, which tore the sail to shreds and brought down the mast.",
    "Wasobioye was unable to return home, and his boat was driven about on the wide ocean for the space of three months.",
    "Then he reached the Sea of Mud, on which he could not catch any fish.",
    "He was soon reduced to sore straits and feared he would die of hunger, but, in time, he caught sight of land and was greatly cheered.",
    "His boat drifted slowly towards a beautiful island on which there were three great mountains.",
    "As he drew near to the shore, he found, to his great joy, that the air was laden with most exquisite perfumes that came from the flowers and tree-blossoms of that wonderful isle.",
    "He landed and found a sparkling well.",
    "When he had drunk of the water his strength was revived, and a feeling of intense pleasure tingled in his veins.",
    "He rose up refreshed and happy and, walking inland, soon met with Jofuku the sage, known in China as Hsu Fü, who had been sent to the Island of the Blest (P’ēng-lai) by the Emperor She Wang Ti to obtain the “fungus of immortality”, with the youths and virgins, but had never returned.",
    "Wasobioye was taken by the friendly sage to the city of the immortals, who spent their lives in the pursuit of pleasure.",
    "He found, however, that these people had grown to dislike their monotonous existence, and were constantly striving to discover some means whereby their days would be shortened.",
    "They refused to partake of mermaid flesh because this was a food that prolonged life; they favoured instead goldfish and soot, a mixture which was supposed to be poisonous.",
    "The manners of the people were curious.",
    "Instead of wishing one another good health and long life, they wished for sickness and a speedy death.",
    "Congratulations were showered on any individual who seemed to be indisposed, and he was sympathized with when he showed signs of recovering.",
    "Wasobioye lived on the island for nearly a quarter of a century.",
    "Then, having grown weary of the monotonous life, he endeavoured to commit suicide by partaking of poisonous fruit, fish, and flesh.",
    "But all his attempts were in vain.",
    "It was impossible for anyone to die on that island.",
    "In time he came to know that he could die if he left it, but he had heard of other wonderful lands and wished to visit them before his days came to an end.",
    "Then, instead of eating poisonous food, he began to feast on mermaid flesh so that his life might be prolonged for many years beyond the allotted span.",
    "Thereafter he visited the Land of Shams, the Land of Plenty, &c.",
    "His last visit was paid to the Land of Giants.",
    "Wasobioye is usually referred to as the “Japanese Gulliver”.",
    "The search for the mythical islands with their “wells of life” and “trees” or “plants of life” is referred to in the stories of many lands and even in history, especially the history of exploration, for the world-wide search for the Earthly Paradise appears to have exercised decided influence in stimulating maritime enterprise in mediæval as well as prehistoric times.",
    "Columbus searched for the island paradise in which the “well” and “tree” were to be found.",
    "He sailed westward so as to approach the paradise “eastward in Eden”,",
    "[177] through “the back door” as it were, and wrote: “The saintly theologians and philosophers were right when they fixed the site of the terrestrial paradise in the extreme Orient, because it is a most temperate clime; and the lands which I have just discovered are the limits of the Orient.”",
    "In another letter he says: “I am convinced that there lies the terrestrial paradise”.",
    "[178] As Ellis reminds us, “the expedition which led to the discovery of Florida was undertaken not so much from a desire to explore unknown countries”, as to find a “celebrated fountain, described in a tradition prevailing among the inhabitants of Puerto Rico, as existing in Binini, one of the Lucayo Islands.",
    "It was said to possess such restorative powers as to renew youth and the vigour of every person who bathed in its waters.",
    "It was in search of this fountain, which was the chief object of their expedition, that Ponce de Leon ranged through the Lucayo Islands and ultimately reached the shores of Florida.”",
    "Ellis refers to this voyage because he found that the mythical island and well were believed in by the Polynesians.",
    "He refers, in this connection, to the “Hawaiian account of the voyage of Kamapiikai to the land where the inhabitants enjoyed perpetual health and youthful beauty, where the wai ora (life-giving fountain) removed every internal malady, and every external deformity or paralysed decrepitude, from all those who were plunged beneath its salutary waters”.",
    "Ellis anticipates the views of modern ethnologists when dealing with the existence of the same beliefs among widely-separated peoples.",
    "He says: “A tabular view of a number of words in the Malayan, Asiatic, or the Madagasse, the American, and the Polynesian languages, would probably show that, at some remote period, either the inhabitants of these distant parts of the world maintained frequent intercourse with each other, or that colonies from some one of them originally peopled, in part or altogether, the others”.",
    "He adds, “Either part of the present inhabitants of the South Sea Islands came originally from America, or tribes of the Polynesians have, at some remote period, found their way to the (American) continent”.",
    "[179] W. D. Westervelt, in his Legends of Old Honolulu, heads his old Hawaiian story “The Water of Life of Ka-ne”, which he himself has collected, with the following extract from the Maori legend of New Zealand: When the moon dies, she goes to the living water of Ka-ne, to the water which can restore all life, even the moon to the path in the sky.",
    "In the Hawaiian form of the legend the hero, who found the water so that his sick father, the king, might be cured, met with a dwarf who instructed him where to go and what to do.",
    "A russet dwarf similarly figures in the Gaelic story of Diarmaid’s search for the cup and the water of life so that the daughter of the King of Land-under-Waves might be cured of her sickness.",

    "The Scandinavians heard of the Gaelic Island of the West during their prolonged sojourn in the British Isles and Ireland, and referred to it as “Ireland hit Mikla” (“The Mickle Ireland”), and the mythical island was afterwards identified with Vinland, believed to be America, which was apparently reached by the hardy sea-rovers.",
    "The Earthly Paradise was also located in Asia.",
    "In the mythical histories of Alexander a hero sets forth like Gilgamesh on the quest of the Water of Life.",
    "He similarly enters a cavern of a great mountain in the west which is guarded by a monster serpent.",
    "In one version of the tale this hero carries a jewel that shines in darkness—a jewel that figures prominently in Chinese lore (Chap.",
    "XIII)—and passes through the dark tunnel.",
    "He reaches the Well of Life and plunges into it.",
    "When he came out he found that his body had turned a bluish-green colour, and ever afterwards he was called “El Khidr”, which means “Green”.",
    "[189] The Well of Life is referred to in the Koran.",
    "Commentators explain a reference to a vanishing fish by telling that Moses or Joshua carried a fried fish when they reached the Well of Life.",
    "Some drops of the water fell on the fish, which at once leapt out of the basket into the sea and swam away.",
    "In the Aryo-Indian epic, the Mahábhárata, the hero Bhima sets out in search of the Lake of Life and the Lotus of Life.",
    "He overcomes the Yaksha-guardians of the lake, and when he bathes in the lake his wounds are healed.",
    "[190] There are glowing descriptions in Buddhist literature of the Paradise reached by those who are to qualify for Buddhahood.",
    "A proportion of the Chinese Taoist inhabitants of the Islands of the Blest similarly wait for the time when they will pass into another state of existence.",
    "A similar belief prevailed in the West.",
    "Certain Celtic heroes, like Arthur, Ossian, Fionn (Finn), Brian Boroimhe, and Thomas the Rhymer, live in Paradise for long periods awaiting the time when they are to return to the world of men, as do Charlemagne, Frederick of Barbarossa, William Tell, and others on the Continent.",
    "In the Buddhist Paradise the pure beings have faces “bright and yellowish”, yellow being the sacred colour of the Buddhist as it is the colour of the chief dragon of China.",
    "In this Paradise is the Celestial Ganges and the great Bodhi-tree, “a hundred yojanas in height”, which prolongs life and increases “their stock of merit”.",
    "Their “merit” may “grow in the following shapes, viz.",
    "either in gold, in silver, in jewels, in beryls, in shells, in stones, in corals, in amber, in red pearls, in diamonds, &c., or in any one of the other jewels; or in all kinds of perfumes, in flowers, in garlands, in ointment, in incense-powder, in cloaks, in umbrellas, in flags, in banners, or in lamps; or in all kinds of dancing, singing, and music”.",
    "[191] The gem-trees abound in this Paradise.",
    "“Of some trees”, one account runs, “the trunks are of coral, the branches of red pearls, the small branches of diamonds, the leaves of gold, the flowers of silver, and the fruits of beryl.”",
    "[192] In the “eastern quarter” there are “Buddha countries equal to the sand of the River Ganga (Ganges)”.",
    "The purified beings in the lands “surpass the light of the sun and moon, by the light of wisdom, and by the whiteness, brilliancy, purity, and beauty of their knowledge”.",
    "[193] There are references to “the king of jewels that fulfils every wish”.",
    "It has “golden-coloured rays excessively beautiful, the radiance of which transforms itself into birds possessing the colours of a hundred jewels, which sing out harmonious notes”.",
    "[194] The purified may become like Buddha “with bodies bright as gold and blue eyes”, for “the eyes of Buddha are like the water of the four great oceans; the blue and the white are quite distinct”.",
    "[195] The imaginations of the Buddhists run riot in their descriptions of the Land of Bliss, and the stream of glowing narrative carries with it many pre-Buddhist beliefs about metals and precious stones, “red pearls, blue pearls”, and so on, and “nets of gold adorned with the emblems of the dolphin, the svastika (swashtika), the nandyāvarta, and the moon”.",
    "[196] In their Paradise even the river mud is of gold.",
    "The religious ideas of the early searchers for “soul substance” in the form of metals and gems are thus found to be quaintly blended with Buddhist conceptions of the Earthly Paradise.",
    "In some Chinese and Japanese stories the souls of the dead are carried to Paradise by birds, and especially by the crane or stork, which takes the place of the Indian man-eagle Garuda (Japanese Gario, the woman-bird with crane’s legs), and of the Babylonian eagle that carried the hero Etana to heaven.",
    "The saints who reach the Indian Paradise of Uttara Kuru, situated at the sources of the River Indus, among the Himalayan mountains, and originally the homeland of the Kuru tribe of Aryans, are supposed to have their lives prolonged for centuries.",
    "When they die their bodies are carried away by gigantic birds and dropped into mountain recesses.",
    "The belief enshrined in stories of this kind may be traced to the wide-spread legend of the Diamond Valley.",

    "“In the west, arriving at the Mediterranean,” one Chinese story runs, “there is in the sea an island of two hundred square miles.",
    "On this island is a large forest, abundant in trees with precious stones, and inhabited by over ten thousand families.",
    "These men show great ability in cleverly working gems, which are named for the country Fu-lin (Syria).",
    "In a north-westerly direction from the island is a ravine, hollowed out like a bowl, more than a thousand feet deep.",
    "They throw flesh into this valley.",
    "Birds take it up in their beaks, whereupon they drop the precious stones.”",
    "Here Fu-lin, in the Mediterranean area, is referred to as early as the beginning of the sixth century.",
    "The Chinese Diamond Valley story is “an abridged form of a well-known Western legend”.",
    "In a version of it in the writings of Epiphanius, Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus (c. 315–403), the valley is situated in “a desert of great Scythia”, and the precious stones are gathered on the mountains, whence the eagles carry them.",
    "The eagle-stone is “useful to women in aiding parturition”.",
    "Laufer notes that Pliny knew about the parturition stone, and that the beliefs associated with it are found in Egypt and India.",
    "In the latter country it occurs in legends about the combats between the eagle and serpent.",
    "[197] A Scottish Gaelic folk-story tells of a man who had a combat with an eagle which carried him away to the floating island of the blest.",
    "He was killed, but came to life again after drops of the water from the well of life were thrown on his body.",
    "Stones found in eagles’ or ravens’ nests, according to Scottish belief, imparted to their possessors the power of prophecy or healing.",
    "The gems from the trees of Paradise in Babylonian, Indian, Chinese, and Japanese literature were supposed to confer special powers on those who became possessed of them.",
    "To this class belongs the “Jewel that grants all Desires”, the “gem that shines in darkness”, the prophet’s or priest’s jewel or jewels, &c. Gems were searched for in ancient times because they were supposed to possess what has been called “soul substance”.",
    "They protected those who wore them from all evil, they assisted birth, they prolonged life.",
    "Precious metals were similarly believed to be “luck-bringers”, and to early man luck meant everything he wished for, including good health, longevity, plentiful supplies of food, a knowledge of the future, offspring, and so on.",
    "In the stories of the Islands of the Blest the happy souls are, in the ancient sense of the term, “lucky souls”.",
    "Paradise was a land in which life-giving water and fruit, and innumerable gems were to be found, and those who reached it became wise as magicians and prophets, and lived for thousands of years free from sickness and pain.",

    "The quest of the “elixir of life”, the “water of life”, or “the food of life” is as prominent a feature of ancient religious literature as is the quest of the Holy Grail in the Arthurian romances.",
    "As has been shown in the last chapter, the belief that prompted the quest was widely prevalent, and of great antiquity.",
    "The Babylonian hero, Gilgamesh, whose story is told in the oldest epic in the world, undertook his long and perilous journey to the Otherworld, in quest of the Plant of Life, because the thought of death was sorrowful to him.",
    "When his friend, Ea-bani, had expired, Gilgamesh wept bitterly, and he lay stretched out upon the ground.",
    "He cried, “Let me not die like Ea-bani....",
    "I fear death.”",
    "[198] In the Babylonian myth of Adapa reference is made to the “water of life” and the “food of life”, which give wisdom and immortality to the gods and to the souls of those mortals who win their favour.",
    "The sacred tree in Babylonian art is evidently the Tree of Life.",
    "[199] We seem to meet with the history of the immemorial quest in the Pyramid Texts of Ancient Egypt.",
    "The ancient priests appear to have concerned themselves greatly regarding the problem how the dead were to be nourished in the celestial Paradise.",
    "“The chief dread felt by the Egyptian for the hereafter,” says Breasted, “was fear of hunger.”",
    "[200] In Egypt, as in other lands offerings of food were made at the tombs, and these were supposed to be conveyed to the souls by certain of the gods.",
    "But those who hoped to live for ever knew well that the time would come when grave-offerings would cease to be made, and their own names would be forgotten on earth.",
    "Some Pharaohs endowed their chapel-tombs for all time, but revolutions ultimately caused endowments to be appropriated.",
    "The Babylonians believed that if the dead were not fed, their ghosts would prowl through the streets and enter houses, searching for food and water.",
    "[201] In Polynesia the homeless and desolate ghosts were those of poor people, “who during their residence in the body had no friends and no property”.",
    "[202] The custom of including food-vessels and drinking-cups in the funerary furniture of prehistoric graves in different countries was no doubt connected with the fear of hunger in the hereafter.",
    "The custom was widespread of giving the dead food offerings at regular intervals.",
    "Once a year the living held feasts in the burial-grounds, and invited the dead to partake of their share.",
    "Among the Hallowe’en beliefs in the British Isles is one that ghosts return home during the year-end festival to attend “the feast of all souls”.",
    "The Hebridean custom, which lingered even in the nineteenth century, of placing food and water, or milk, beside a corpse while it lay in a house, and outside the door or at the grave after the burial took place, was no doubt a relic of an ancient custom, based on the haunting belief that the dead were in need of nourishment, if not for all time, at any rate until the journey to the Otherworld was completed.",
    "As has been said, it was the provision of food in the celestial Paradise, far removed from the earth and its produce, that chiefly concerned the Egyptians.",
    "In the Underworld Kingdom, presided over by Osiris, the souls grew corn and gathered fruit.",
    "But the Paradise of the solar cult was above or beyond the sky.",
    "Some of the sun-worshippers are found in the Pyramid Texts to have placed their faith in the food-supplying Great Mother, the goddess Hathor, who gave them corn and milk during their earthly lives.",
    "As son of Re, born of the sky-goddess, he (the Pharaoh) is frequently represented as suckled by one of the sky-goddesses, or some other divinity connected with Re, especially the ancient goddesses of the prehistoric kingdoms of South and North.",
    "These appear as “the two vultures with long hair and hanging breasts; ... they draw their breasts over the mouth of King Pepi, but they do not wean him forever....”",
    "Another text invokes the mother-goddess: “Give thy breast to this King Pepi, ... suckle this King Pepi therewith”.",
    "As a result, perhaps, of the prevalence of Osirian beliefs, the solar cult adopted the idea that food, such as is found in Egypt, might be provided in the regions above or beyond the sky.",
    "The sun-god was appealed to: “Give thou bread to this King Pepi, from this thy eternal bread, thy everlasting beer”.",
    "[203] But the chief source of nourishment in the celestial Paradise was the Tree of Life (a form of the mother-goddess) on the great isle in the mythical lake or sea beyond the Eastern horizon.",
    "[204] Egyptian artists depicted this tree as a palm, or sycamore, with a goddess rising from inside it, pouring water from a vessel on the hands of the Pharaoh’s soul, which might appear in human form, or in the man-bird form called the ba.",
    "In the funeral ritual the ceremony of pouring out a libation was performed with the object of restoring the body moisture (the water of life) to the mummy.",
    "[205] A Biblical reference to the ceremony is found in 2 Kings, iii, 11, in which it is said of Elisha that he “poured water on the hands of Elijah”.",
    "No doubt the Egyptian soul received water as nourishment, as well as to ensure its immortality, from the tree-goddess.",
    "In the Book of the Dead (Chapter LIX), the Tree of Life is referred to as “the sycamore of Nut” (the sky-goddess).",
    "Other texts call the tree “the Western Tree” of Nut or Hathor.",
    "It may be that the solar cult of the East took over the tree from the Osirian cult of the West.",
    "This mythical tree figures in many ancient mythologies.",
    "The goddess Europa was worshipped at Gortyna, in Crete, during the Hellenic period, as a sacred tree.",
    "[206] The tree may be traced from the British Isles to India, and there are numerous legends of spirits entering or leaving it.",
    "The Polynesians have stories of this kind.",
    "Their Tree of Life was the local bread-fruit tree which “became a god”, or, as some had it, a goddess.",
    "“Out of this magic bread-fruit tree,” a legend says, “a great goddess was made.”",
    "[207] It may be that the island Paradise with its Tree of Life was specially favoured after maritime enterprise made strong appeal to the imagination of the Egyptians.",
    "No doubt the old sailors who searched for “soul-substance” in the shape of pearls, precious stones, and metals had much to do with disseminating the idea of the Isles of the Blest.",
    "At any rate, it became, as we have seen, a tradition among seafarers to search for the distant land in which was situated the “water of life”.",
    "The home-dwelling Osirians clung to their idea of an Underworld Paradise, and belief in it became fused with that of the floating island, or Islands of the Blest.",
    "Those who dwelt in inland plains and valleys, and those accustomed to cross the great mysterious deserts on which the oasis-mirage frequently appeared and vanished like the mythical floating island, conceived of a Paradise on earth.",
    "There are references in more than one land to a Paradise among the mountains.",
    "It figures in the fairy stories of Central Europe, for instance, as “the wonderful Rose Garden” with its linden Tree of Immortality, the hiding-place of a fairy lady, its dancing nymphs and its dwarfs; the king of dwarfs has a cloak of invisibility which he wraps round those mortals he carries away.",
    "[208] At first only the souls of kings entered Paradise.",
    "But, in time, the belief became firmly established that the souls of others could reach it too, and be fed there.",
    "The quest of the “food of life” then became a popular theme of the story-tellers, and so familiar grew the idea of the existence of this fruit that people believed it could be obtained during life, and that those who partook of it might have their days prolonged indefinitely.",
    "For, as W. Schooling has written, “a few simple thoughts on a few simple subjects produce a few simple opinions common to a whole tribe” (and even a great part of mankind), “and are taught with but little modification to successive generations; hence arises a rigidity that imposes ready-made opinions, which are seldom questioned, while such questioning as does occur is usually met with excessive severity, as Galileo and others have found out”.",
    "[209] The apple, as we have seen, was to the Celts the fruit of immortality: the Chinese favoured the peach—that is, it was favoured by the Chinese cult of the West.",
    "As all animals were supposed to be represented in the Otherworld by gigantic prototypes—the fathers or mothers of their kind—so were trees represented by a gigantic tree.",
    "[210] This tree was the World Tree that supported the Universe.",
    "In Egypt the World Tree was the sycamore of the sky-goddess, who was the Great Mother of deities and mankind.",
    "The sun dropped into the sycamore at eventide; when darkness fell the swallows (star-gods) perched in its branches.",
    "In Norse mythology the tree is the ash, called Ygdrasil, and from the well at its roots souls receive the Hades-drink of immortality, drinking from a horn embellished with serpent symbols.",
    "The Tree figures prominently in Iranian mythology: the Aryo-Indian Indra constructs the World-house round it.",
    "This Tree is, no doubt, identical with the sacred tree in Assyrian art, which is sometimes the date, the vine, the pomegranate, the fir, the cedar, and perhaps the oak.",
    "It may be that the Biblical parable about the talking trees is a memory of the rivalries of the various Assyrian tree cults: The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.",
    "But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour god and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?",
    "And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.",
    "But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?",
    "Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.",
    "And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my vine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?",
    "Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.",
    "And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me King over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.",
    "As in Assyria, there was in China quite a selection of life-giving trees.",
    "The Chinese gigantic Peach Tree, whose fruit was partaken of by gods and men, grew in the Paradise among the Kwun-lun mountains in Tibet, and, like the Indian Mount Meru (“world spine”), supported the Universe.",
    "Its fruit took three thousand years to ripen.",
    "The tree was surrounded by a beautiful garden, and was under the care of the fairy-like lady Si Wang Mu, the queen of immortals, the “Mother of the Western King”, and the “Royal Mother of the West”.",
    "She appears to have originally been the mother-goddess—the Far-Eastern form of Hathor.",
    "In Japan she is called Seiobo.",
    "Her Paradise, which is called “the palace of exalted purity”, and “the metropolis of the pearl mountain”, or of “the jade mountain”, and is entered through “the golden door”, [211] was originally that of the cult of the West.",
    "Sometimes Si Wang Mu is depicted as quite as weird a deity as the Phigalian Demeter, with disordered hair, tiger’s teeth, and a panther’s tail.",
    "Her voice is harsh, and she sends and cures diseases.",
    "Three blue birds bring food to her.",
    "Chinese emperors and magicians were as anxious to obtain a peach from the Royal Mother’s tree in the Western Paradise, as they were to import the “fungus of immortality” from the Islands of the Blest in the Eastern Sea.",
    "There once lived in China a magician named Tung Fang So, who figures in Japanese legend as Tobosaku, and is represented in Japanese art as a jolly old man, clasping a peach to his breast and performing a dance, or as a dreamy sage, carrying two or three peaches, and accompanied by a deer—an animal which symbolized longevity.",
    "Various legends have gathered round his name.",
    "One is that he had several successive rebirths in various reigns, and that originally he was an avatar of the planet Venus.",
    "He may therefore represent the Far-Eastern Tammuz, the son of the mother-goddess.",
    "Another legend tells that he filched three peaches from the Tree of Life, which had been plucked by the “Royal Mother of the West”.",
    "Tung Fang So was a councillor in the court of Wu Ti, the fourth emperor of the Han Dynasty, who reigned for over half a century, and died after fasting for seven days in 87 B.C.",
    "In Japanese stories Wu Ti is called Kan no Buti.",
    "He was greatly concerned about finding the “water of life” or the “fruit of life”, so that his days might be prolonged.",
    "In his palace garden he caused to be erected a tower over 100 feet high, which appears to have been an imitation of a Babylonian temple.",
    "On its summit was the bronze image of a god, holding a golden vase in its hands.",
    "In this vase was collected the pure dew that was supposed to drip from the stars.",
    "The emperor drank the dew, believing that it would renew his youth.",
    "One day there appeared before Wu Ti in the palace garden a beautiful green sparrow.",
    "In China and Japan the sparrow is a symbol of gentleness, and a sparrow of uncommon colour is supposed to indicate that something unusual is to happen.",
    "The emperor was puzzled regarding the bird-omen, and consulted",
    "Tung Fang So, who informed him that the Queen of Immortals was about to visit the royal palace.",
    "Before long Si Wang Mu made her appearance.",
    "She had come all the way from her garden among the Kwun-lun mountains, riding on the back of a white dragon, with seven of the peaches of immortality, which were carried on a tray by a dwarf servant.",
    "Her fairy majesty was gorgeously attired in white and gold, and spoke with a voice of bird-like sweetness.",
    "When she reached Wu Ti there were only four peaches on the tray, and she lifted one up and began to eat it.",
    "The peach was her symbol, as the apple was that of Aphrodite.",
    "Tung Fang So peered at her through a window, and when she caught sight of his smiling face, she informed the emperor that he had stolen three of her peaches.",
    "Wu Ti received a peach from her, and, having eaten it, became an immortal.",
    "A similar story is told regarding the Chinese Emperor, Muh Wang.",
    "In her “Jade Mountain” Paradise of the West (the highest peak of the Kwun-lun mountains) this goddess is accompanied by her sister, as the Egyptian Isis is by Nephthys, and the pair are supposed to flit about in Cloud-land, followed by the white souls of good women of the Taoist cult.",
    "Her attendants include the Blue Stork, the White Tiger, the Stag, and the gigantic Tortoise, which are all gods and symbols of longevity in China.",
    "Among the many stories told about Tung Fang So is one regarding a visit he once paid to the mythical Purple Sea.",
    "He returned after the absence of a year, and on being remonstrated with by his brother for deserting his home for so long a period, he contended that he had been away for only a single day.",
    "His garments had been discoloured by the waters of the Purple Sea, and he had gone to another sea to cleanse them.",
    "In like manner heroes who visit Fairyland find that time slips past very quickly.",
    "The Purple Sea idea may have been derived from the ancient Well of Life story about El Khidr, [212] whose body and clothing turned green after he had bathed in it.",
    "Purple supplanted green and blue as the colour of immortality and royalty after murex dye became the great commercial asset of sea-traders.",
    "Tung Fang So may have had attached to his memory a late and imported version of the El Khidr story.",
    "The reference to Wu Ti’s dew-drinking habit recalls the story of the youthful Keu Tze Tung, a court favourite, who unwittingly offended the emperor, Muh Wang, and was banished.",
    "As the Egyptian Bata, who similarly fell into disgrace in consequence of a false charge being made against him, fled to the “Valley of the Acacia”, Keu Tze Tung fled to the “Valley of the Chrysanthemum”.",
    "There he drank the dew that dropped from the petals of chrysanthemums, and became an immortal.",
    "The Buddhists took over this story, and told that the youth had been given a sacred text, which he painted on the petals.",
    "This text imparted to the dew its special qualities.",
    "In the Far East the chrysanthemum is a symbol of purity.",
    "The chrysanthemum with sixteen petals is the emblem of the Mikado of Japan.",
    "A Chinese sage, who, like the Indian Rishis, practised yoga until he became immortal, engaged his spare moments in painting fish.",
    "He lived on the bank of a stream for over two hundred years.",
    "In the end he was carried away to the Underworld Paradise of the Lord of Fish, who was, of course, the dragon-god.",
    "He paid one return visit to his disciples, riding like the Chinese “Boy Blue” in the dragon story, on the back of a red carp.",
    "Another Chinese “tree-cult” favoured, instead of the peach tree, a cassia tree.",
    "This cassia-cult must have been late.",
    "The peach tree is indigenous.",
    "“Of fruits,” says Laufer, “the West is chiefly indebted to China for the peach (Amygdalus persica) and the apricot (Prunus armeniaca).",
    "It is not impossible that these two gifts were transmitted by the silk-dealers, first to Iran (in the second or first century B.C.) and thence to Armenia, Greece, and Rome (in the first century A.D.).”",
    "In India the peach is called cinani (“Chinese fruit”).",
    "“There is no Sanskrit name for the tree (peach); nor does it play any rôle in the folk-lore of India, as it does in China.” ...",
    "Persia “has only descriptive names for these fruits, the peach being termed saft alu (‘large plum’), the apricot, zard alu (‘yellow plum’).”",
    "[213] It is difficult to identify the cassia tree of Chinese religious literature.",
    "“The Chinese word Kwei occurs at an early date, but it is a generic term for Lauraceæ; and there are about thirteen species of Cassia, and about sixteen species of Cinnamomum in China.",
    "The essential point is that the ancient texts maintain silence as to cinnamon; that is, the product from the bark of the tree.",
    "Cinnamomum cassia is a native of Kwan-si, Kwan-tun, and Indo-China; and the Chinese made its first acquaintance under the Han, when they began to colonize and to absorb southern China.”",
    "The first description of this tree goes no farther back than the third century.",
    "“It was not the Chinese, but non-Chinese peoples of Indo-China who first brought the tree into civilization, which, like all other southern cultivations, was simply adopted by the conquering Chinese.”",
    "[214] It has been suggested that the cinnamon bark was imported into Egypt from China as far back as the Empire period (c. 1500 B.C.) by Phœnician sea-traders.",
    "[215] Laufer rejects this theory.",
    "[216] Apparently the ancient Egyptians imported a fragrant bark from their Punt (Somaliland, or British East Africa).",
    "At a very much later period cinnamon bark was carried across the Indian Ocean from Ceylon.",
    "The Egyptians imported incense-bearing trees from Punt to restore the “odours of the body” of the dead, and poured out libations to restore its lost moisture.",
    "[217] “When”, writes Professor Elliot Smith, “the belief became well established that the burning of incense was potent as an animating force, and especially a giver of life to the dead, it naturally came to be regarded as a divine substance in the sense that it had the power of resurrection.",
    "As the grains of incense consisted of the exudation of trees, or, as the ancient texts express it, ‘their sweat’, the divine power of animation in course of time became transferred to trees.",
    "They were no longer merely the source of the life-giving incense, but were themselves animated by the deity, whose drops of sweat were the means of conveying life to the mummy....",
    "The sap of trees was brought into relationship with life-giving water....",
    "The sap was also regarded as the blood of trees and the incense that exuded as sweat.”",
    "As De Groot reminds us, “tales of trees that shed blood, and that cry out when hurt are common in Chinese literature (as also in Southern Arabia, notes Elliot Smith); also of trees that lodge, or can change into maidens of transcendent beauty.”",
    "[218] Apparently the ancient seafarers who searched for incense-bearing trees carried their beliefs to distant countries.",
    "The goddess-tree of the peach cult was evidently the earliest in China.",
    "It bore the fruit of life.",
    "The influence that led to the foundation of this cult probably came by an overland route.",
    "The cassia-tree cult was later, and beliefs connected with it came from Southern China; these, too, bear the imprint of ideas that were well developed before they reached China.",
    "There are references in Chinese lore to a gigantic cassia tree which was 10,000 feet high.",
    "Those who ate of its fruit became immortal.",
    "The earlier belief connected with the peach tree was that the soul who ate one of its peaches lived for 3000 years.",
    "This cassia world-tree appears first to have taken the place of the peach tree of the “Royal Mother of the West”.",
    "It was reached by sailing up the holiest river in China, the Hoang-Ho (Yellow River), the sources of which are in the Koko-Nor territory to the north of Tibet.",
    "It wriggles like a serpent between mountain barriers before it flows northward; then it flows southward for 200 miles on the eastern border of Shensi province (the Chinese homeland), and then eastward for 200 miles, afterwards diverging in a north-easterly direction towards the Gulf of Chihli, in which the Islands of the Blest were supposed to be situated.",
    "It was believed that the Hoang-Ho had, like the Ganges of India and the Nile of Egypt, a celestial origin.",
    "Those sages who desired to obtain a glimpse of Paradise sailed up the river to its fountain head.",
    "Some reached the tree and the garden of Paradise.",
    "Others found themselves sailing across the heavens.",
    "The Western Paradise was evidently supposed by some to be situated in the middle of the world, and by others to have been situated beyond the horizon.",
    "Chang Kiʼen, one of the famous men attached to the court of Wu Ti, the reviver of many ancient beliefs and myths, was credited with having followed the course of the sacred river until he reached the spot where the cassia tree grew.",
    "Beside the tree were the immortal animals that haunt the garden of the “Royal Mother of the West”.",
    "In addition, Chang Kiʼen saw the moon-rabbit or moon-hare, which is adored as a rice-giver.",
    "In the Far East, as in the Near East and in the West, the moon is supposed to ripen crops.",
    "The lunar rabbit or hare is associated with water; in the moon grow plants and a tree of immortality.",
    "There is also, according to Chinese belief, a frog in the moon.",
    "It was originally a woman, the wife of a renowned archer, who rescued the moon from imprisonment in masses of black rain-clouds.",
    "The “Royal Mother of the West” was so grateful to the archer for the service he had rendered that she gave him a jade cup filled with the dew of immortality.",
    "His wife stole the cup and drank the dew.",
    "For this offence the “Royal Mother of the West” transformed her into a frog, and imprisoned her in the moon.",
    "In Egypt the frog was a symbol of resurrection or rebirth, and the old frog-goddess Hekt is usually regarded as a form of Hathor, the Great Mother.",
    "The lunar tree is sometimes identified with the cassia tree of immortality.",
    "Its leaves are red as blood, and the bodies of those who eat of its fruit become as transparent as still water.",
    "The moon-water which nourishes plants and trees (eight lunar trees of immortality are referred to in some legends), and the dew of immortality in the jade cup, appear to be identical with the Indian soma and the nectar of the classical gods.",
    "In Norse mythology the lunar water-pot (a symbol of the mother-goddess) was filled at a well by two children, the boy Hyuki and the girl Bil, [219] who were carried away by the moon-god Mani.",
    "Odin was also credited with having recovered the moon-mead from the hall of Suttung, “the mead wolf”, after it had been stolen from the moon.",
    "The god flew heavenward, carrying the mead, in the form of an eagle.",
    "[220] Zeus’s eagle is similarly a nectar-bringer.",
    "In Indian mythology the soma was contained in a bowl fashioned by Twashtri, the divine artisan, and was drunk by the gods, and especially by Indra, the rain-bringer.",
    "A Vedic frog-hymn was chanted by Aryo-Indian priests as a rain-charm when Indra’s services were requisitioned.",
    "In one of the Indian legends an eagle or falcon carries the soma to Indra.",
    "The souls who reach Paradise are made immortal after they drink of the soma.",
    "In India the soma was personified, and the lunar god, Soma, became a god of love, immortality, and fertility.",
    "The soma juice was obtained by the Vedic priests from some unknown plant.",
    "There are also references in Indian mythology to the “Amrita”, which was partaken of by the gods.",
    "It was the sap of sacred trees that grew in Paradise.",
    "Trees and plants derived their life and sustenance from water.",
    "The Far-Eastern beliefs in “the dew of immortality”, “the fungus of immortality”, and “the fruit of immortality” have an intimate connection with the belief that the mother-goddess was connected with the moon, which exercised an influence over water.",
    "The mother-goddess was also the love-goddess, the Ishtar of Babylonia, the Hathor of Egypt, the Aphrodite of Greece.",
    "Her son, or husband, was, in one of his phases, the love-god.",
    "The sage of the Chinese Emperor Wu Ti, who followed the course of the Yellow River so as to reach the celestial Paradise, saw, in addition to the moon-rabbit, or hare, the “Old Man of the Moon”, the Chinese Wu Kang and Japanese Gekkawo, the god of love and marriage.",
    "He is supposed to unite lovers by binding their feet with invisible red silk cords.",
    "The “Old Man in the Moon” is, in Chinese legend, engaged in chopping branches from the cassia tree of immortality.",
    "New branches immediately sprout forth to replace those thus removed, but the “Old Man” has to go on cutting till the end of time, having committed a sin for which his increasing labour is the appropriate punishment.",
    "A Buddhist legend makes Indra the old man.",
    "He asked for food from the hare, the ape, and the fox.",
    "The hare lit a fire and leapt into it so that the god might be fed.",
    "Indra was so much impressed by this supreme act of friendship and charity that he placed the exemplary hare in the moon.",
    "A version of this story is given in the Mahábhárata.",
    "In European folk-lore the “Old Man” is either a thief who stole a bundle of faggots, or a man who “broke the Sabbath” by cutting sticks on that holy day.",
    "See the rustic in the Moon, How his bundle weighs him down; Thus his sticks the truth reveal It never profits man to steal.",
    "Various versions of the Man in the Moon myth are given by S. Baring-Gould, [221] who draws attention to a curious seal “appended to a deed preserved in the Record office, dated the 9th year of Edward the Third (1335)”.",
    "It shows the “Man in the Moon” carrying his sticks and accompanied by his dog.",
    "Two stars are added.",
    "The inscription on the seal is, “Te Waltere docebo cur spinas phebo gero (I will teach thee, Walter, why I carry thorns in the moon)”.",
    "The deed is one of conveyance of property from a man whose Christian name was Walter.",
    "Wu Ti’s sage travelled through the celestial regions until he reached the Milky Way, the source of the Yellow River.",
    "He saw the Spinning Maiden, whose radiant garment is adorned with silver stars.",
    "She had a lover, from whom she was separated, but once a year she was allowed to visit him, and passed across the heavens as a meteor.",
    "This Spinning Maiden, who weaves the net of the constellations, is reminiscent of the Egyptian sky-goddess, Hathor (or Nut), whose body is covered with stars, and whose legs and arms, as she bends over the earth, “represent the four pillars on which the sky was supposed to rest and mark the four cardinal points”.",
    "Her lover, from whom she was separated, was Seb.",
    "[222] In China certain groups of stars are referred to as the “Celestial Door”, the “Hall of Heaven”, &",
    "c. Taoist saints dwell in stellar abodes, as well as on the “Islands of the Blest”; some were, during their life on earth, incarnations of star-gods.",
    "The lower ranks of the western-cult immortals remain in the garden of the “Royal Mother”; those of the highest rank ascend to the stars.",
    "Wu Ti’s sage, according to one form of the legend, never returned to earth.",
    "His boat, which sailed up the Yellow River and then along the “Milky Way”, was believed to have reached the Celestial River that flows round the Universe, and along which sails the sun-barque of the Egyptian god Ra (or Re).",
    "One day the Chinese sage’s oar—apparently his steering oar—was deposited in the Royal Palace grounds by a celestial spirit, who descended from the sky.",
    "Here we have, perhaps, a faint memory of the visits paid to earth from the celestial barque by the Egyptian god Thoth, in his captivity as envoy of the sun-god Ra.",
    "There is evidence in Far-Eastern folk-tales that at a very remote period the beliefs of the cult of the sky-goddess, which placed the tree of immortality in the “moon island”, and the beliefs of the peach cult of “the Westerners” were fused, as were those of the Osirian and solar cults in Egypt.",
    "A curious story tells that once upon a time a man went to fish on the Yellow River.",
    "A storm arose, and his boat was driven into a tributary, the banks of which were fringed with innumerable peach trees in full blossom.",
    "He reached an island, on which he landed.",
    "There he was kindly treated by the inhabitants, who told that they had fled from China because of the oppression of the emperor.",
    "This surprised the fisherman greatly.",
    "He asked for particulars, and was given the name of an emperor who had died about 500 years before he himself was born.",
    "“What is the name of this island?”",
    "he asked.",
    "The inhabitants were unable to tell him.",
    "“We came hither,” they said, “just as you have come.",
    "We are strangers in a strange land.”",
    "Next day the wanderer launched his boat and set out to return by the way he had come.",
    "He sailed on all day and all night, and when morning came he found himself amidst familiar landmarks.",
    "He was able to return home.",
    "When the fisherman told the story to a priest, he was informed that he had reached the land of the Celestials, and that the river fringed by peach trees in blossom was the Milky Way.",
    "In this story the Chinese Island of the Blest is, like the Nilotic “green bed of Horus”, a river island.",
    "Another memory of the Celestial River and the Barque of the Sun is enshrined in the story of Lo Tze Fang, a holy woman of China who ascended to heaven by climbing a high tree—apparently the “world-tree”.",
    "After reaching the celestial regions she was carried along the Celestial River in a boat.",
    "According to the story, she still sails each day across the heavens.",
    "Other saintly people have been carried to the celestial regions by dragons.",
    "According to Chinese belief the “Yellow Dragon” is connected with the moon.",
    "The reflection of the moon on rippling water is usually referred to as the “Golden Dragon”, or “Yellow Dragon”, the chief of Chinese dragons, and usually associated with the sun.",
    "One of the classes of Chinese holy men of the Spirit-world, the Sien Nung, who bear a close resemblance to Indian Rishis, is connected with the moon cult.",
    "They are believed to prolong their lives by eating the leaves of the lunar plants.",
    "In an Egyptian legend it is told that Osiris was the son of the Mother Cow, who had conceived him when a fertilizing ray of light fell from the moon.",
    "In like manner a moon-girl came into being in Japan.",
    "She was discovered by a wood-cutter.",
    "One day, when collecting bamboo, he found inside a cane a little baby, whose body shone as does a gem in darkness.",
    "He took her home to his wife, and she grew up to be a very beautiful girl.",
    "She was called “Moon Ray”, and after living for a time on the earth returned to the moon.",
    "She had maintained her youthful appearance by drinking, from a small vessel she possessed, the fluid of immortality.",
    "As the dragon was connected with the moon, and the moon with the bamboo, it might be expected that the dragon and bamboo would be closely linked.",
    "One of the holy men is credited with having reached the lunar heaven by cutting down a bamboo, which he afterwards transformed into a dragon.",
    "He rode heavenwards on the dragon’s back.",
    "Saintly women, as a rule, rise to heaven in the form of birds, or in their own form, without wings, on account of the soul-like lightness of their bodies, which have become purified by performing religious rites and engaging in prayer and meditation.",
    "Their husbands have either to climb trees or great mountains.",
    "Some holy women, after reaching heaven, ride along the clouds on the back of the Kʼilin, the bisexual monster that the soul of Confucius is supposed to ride.",
    "It is a form of the dragon, but more like the makara of the Indian god Varuna than the typical “wonder beast” of China and Japan.",
    "Some of these monsters resemble lions, dogs, deer, walruses, or unicorns.",
    "They are all, however, varieties of the makara.",
    "Sometimes we find that the attributes of the Great Mother, who, like Aphrodite, was a “Postponer of Old Age” (Ambologera), being the provider of the fruit of immortality and a personification of the World Tree, have been attached to the memory of some famous lady, and especially an empress.",
    "As the Egyptian Pharaoh, according to the beliefs of the solar cult, became Ra (the sun-god) after death, so did the Chinese empress become the “Royal Lady of the West”.",
    "Nu Kwa, a mythical empress of China, was reputed to have become a goddess after she had passed to the celestial regions.",
    "She figures in the Chinese Deluge Myth.",
    "Like the Babylonian Ishtar, she was opposed to the policy of destroying mankind.",
    "She did not, however, like Ishtar, content herself by expressing regret.",
    "When the demons of water and fire, aided by rebel generals of her empire, set out to destroy the world, Nu Kwa waged war against them.",
    "Her campaign was successful, but not until a gigantic warrior had partly destroyed the heavens by upsetting one of its pillars and the flood had covered a great portion of the earth.",
    "The empress stemmed the rising waters by means of charred reeds (a Babylonian touch), and afterwards rebuilt the broken pillar, under which was placed an Atlas-tortoise.",
    "Like Marduk (Merodach), she then set the Universe in order, and formed the channel for the Celestial River.",
    "Thereafter she created the guardians of the four quarters, placing the Black Tortoise in the north, and giving it control over winter; the Blue Dragon in the east, who was given control over spring; the White Tiger in the west, who was given control over autumn; and the Red Bird in the south, who was given control over summer, with the Golden Dragon, whose special duty was to guard the sun, the moon being protected by the White Deity of the west.",
    "The broken pillar of heaven was built up with stones coloured like the five gods.",
    "Among the gifts conferred on mankind by this Empress-Goddess was jade, which she created so that they might be protected against evil influence and decay.",
    "In this Deluge Myth, which is evidently of Babylonian origin, the gods figure as rebels and demons.",
    "The Mother Goddess is the protector of the Universe, and the friend of man.",
    "Evidently the cult of the Mother Goddess was at one time very powerful in China.",
    "In Japan the Empress Nu Kwa is remembered as Jokwa.",
    "The Tree of Immortality, as has been seen, is closely associated with the Far Eastern Mother Goddess, who may appear before favoured mortals either as a beautiful woman, as a dragon, or as a woman riding on a dragon, or as half woman and half fish, or half woman and half serpent.",
    "It is from the goddess that the tree receives its “soul substance”; in a sense, she is the tree, as she is the moon and the pot of life-water, or the mead in the moon.",
    "The fruits of the tree are symbols of her as the mother, and the sap of the tree is her blood.",
    "Reference has been made to Far Eastern stories about dragons transforming themselves into trees and trees becoming dragons.",
    "The tree was a “kupua” of the dragon.",
    "The mother of Adonis was a tree—Myrrha—the daughter of King Cinyras of Cyprus, who was transformed into a myrrh tree.",
    "A Japanese legend relates that a hero, named Manko, once saw a beautiful woman sitting on a tree-trunk that floated on the sea.",
    "She vanished suddenly.",
    "Manko had the tree taken into his boat, and found that the woman was hidden inside the trunk.",
    "She was a daughter of the Dragon King of Ocean.",
    "A better-known Japanese tree hero is Momotaro (momo, peach, taro, eldest son), whose name is usually rendered in English as “Little Peachling”.",
    "He is known in folk-stories as a slayer of demons—a veritable Jack the Giant-Killer.",
    "The legend runs that one day an old wood-cutter went out to gather firewood, while his wife washed dirty clothes in a river.",
    "After the woman had finished her work, she saw a gigantic peach drifting past.",
    "Seizing a pole, she brought it into shallow water, and thus secured it.",
    "The size of the peach astonished her greatly, and she carried it home, and, having washed it, placed it before her husband when he returned home for his evening meal.",
    "No sooner did the wood-cutter begin to cut open the peach than a baby boy emerged from the kernel.",
    "The couple, being childless, were greatly delighted, and looked upon the child as a gift from the Celestials, and they believed he had been sent so as to become their comfort and helper when they grew too old to work.",
    "Momotaro, “the elder son of the peach”, as they called him, grew up to be a strong and valiant young man, who performed feats of strength that caused everyone to wonder at him.",
    "There came a day when, to the sorrow of his foster-parents, he announced that he had resolved to leave home and go to the Isle of Demons, with purpose to secure a portion of their treasure.",
    "This seemed to be a perilous undertaking, and the old couple attempted to make him change his mind.",
    "Momotaro, however, laughed at their fears, and said: “Please make some millet dumplings for me.",
    "I shall need food for my journey.”",
    "His foster-mother prepared the dumplings and muttered good wishes over them.",
    "Then Momotaro bade the old couple an affectionate farewell, and went on his way.",
    "The young hero had not travelled far when he met a dog, which barked out: “Bow-wow!",
    "where are you going, Peach-son?”",
    "“I am going to the Isle of Demons to obtain treasure,” the lad answered.",
    "“Bow-wow!",
    "what are you carrying?”",
    "“I am carrying millet dumplings that my mother made for me.",
    "No one in Japan can make better dumplings than these.”",
    "“Bow-wow! give me one",
    "and I shall go with you to the Isle of Demons.”",
    "The lad gave the dog a dumpling, and it followed at his heels.",
    "Momotaro had not gone much farther when a monkey, perched on a tree, called out to him, saying: “Kia! Kia!",
    "where are you going, Son of a Peach?”",
    "Momotaro answered the monkey as he had answered the dog.",
    "The monkey asked for a dumpling, promising to join the party, and when he received one he set off with the lad and the dog.",
    "The next animal that hailed the lad was a pheasant, who called out: “Ken! Ken!",
    "where are you going, Son of a Peach?”",
    "Momotaro told him, and the bird, having received the dumpling he asked for, accompanied the lad, the dog, and the monkey on the quest of treasure.",
    "When the Island of Demons was reached they all went together towards the fortress in which the demon king resided.",
    "The pheasant flew inside to act as a spy.",
    "Then the monkey climbed over the wall and opened the gate, so that Momotaro and the dog were able to enter the fortress without difficulty.",
    "The demons, however, soon caught sight of the intruders, and attempted to kill them.",
    "Momotaro fought fiercely, assisted by the friendly animals, and slew or scattered in flight the demon warriors.",
    "Then they found their way into the royal palace and made Akandoji, the king of demons, their prisoner.",
    "This great demon was prepared to wield his terrible club of iron, but Momotaro, who was an expert in the jiu-jitsu system of wrestling, seized the demon king and threw him down, and, with the help of the monkey, bound him with a rope.",
    "Momotaro threatened to put Akandoji to death if he would not reveal where his treasure was hidden.",
    "The king bade his servants do homage to the Son of the Peach and to bring forth the treasure, which included the cap and coat of invisibility, magic jewels that controlled the ebb and flow of ocean, gems that shone in darkness and gave protection against all evil to those who wore them, tortoise-shell and jade charms, and a great quantity of gold and silver.",
    "Momotaro took possession of as much of the treasure as he could carry, and returned home a very rich man.",
    "He built a great house, and lived in it with his foster-parents, who were given everything they desired as long as they lived.",
    "In this story may be detected a mosaic of myths.",
    "The Egyptian Horus, whose island floated down the Nile, had white sandals which enabled him to go swiftly up and down the land of Egypt.",
    "There are references in the Pyramid Texts to his youthful exploits, but the full story of them has not yet been discovered.",
    "The Babylonian Tammuz, when a child, drifted in a “sunken boat” down the River Euphrates.",
    "No doubt this myth is the one attached to the memory of Sargon of Akkad,",
    "[223] the son of a vestal virgin, who was placed in an ark and set adrift on the river.",
    "He was found by a gardener, and was afterwards raised to the kingship by the goddess Ishtar.",
    "Karna, the Aryo-Indian Hector, the son of Surya, the sun-god, and the virgin-princess Pritha, was similarly set adrift in an ark, and was rescued from the Ganges by a childless woman whose husband was a charioteer.",
    "The poor couple reared the future hero as their own son.",
    "[224] Adonis, the son of the myrrh tree, was a Syrian form of Tammuz.",
    "Horus was the son of Osiris, whose body was enclosed by a tree after Set caused his death by setting him adrift in a chest.",
    "When Isis found the tree, which had been cut down for a pillar, the posthumous conception of the son of Osiris took place.",
    "[225] The Momotaro legend has thus a long history.",
    "The friendly animals figure in the folk-tales of many lands.",
    "Momotaro’s fight for the treasure, including the cloak of invisibility, bears a close resemblance to Siegfried’s fight for the treasure of the Nibelungs.",
    "[226] In western European, as in Far Eastern lore, the treasure is guarded by dragons as well as by dwarfs and giants and other demons.",
    "When the dragon-slayer is not accompanied by friendly animals, he receives help and advice from birds whose language he acquires by eating a part of the dragon, or, as in the Egyptian tale, after getting possession of the book of spells, guarded by the “Deathless Snake”.",
    "When the Egyptian hero reads the spells he understands the language of birds, beasts, and fishes.",
    "The treasure-guarding dragon appears, as has been suggested, to have had origin in the belief that sharks were the guardians of pearl-beds and preyed upon the divers who stole their treasure.",
    "The beliefs connected with the life-giving virtues of the tree of the Mother Goddess were attached to shells, pearls, gold, and jade.",
    "The goddess was the source of all life, and one of her forms was the dragon.",
    "As the dragon-mother she created or gave birth to the dragon-gods.",
    "Dragon-bones were ground down for medicinal purposes; dragon-herbs cured diseases; the sap of dragon-trees, like the fruit, promoted longevity, as did the jade which the goddess had created for mankind.",
    "The beliefs connected with jade were similar to those connected with pearls, which were at a remote period emblems of the moon in Egypt.",
    "In China the moon was “the pearl of heaven”.",
    "One curious and widespread belief was that pearls were formed by rain-drops, or by drops of dew from the moon, the source of moisture, and especially of nectar or soma.",
    "Pearls and pearl-shells were used for medicinal purposes.",
    "They were, like the sap of trees, the very essence of life—the soul-substance of the Great Mother.",
    "[227] That the complex ideas regarding shells, pearls, dew, trees, the moon, the sun, the stars, and the Great Mother were of “spontaneous generation” in many separated countries is difficult to believe.",
    "It is more probable that the culture-complexes enshrined in folk-tales and religious texts had a definite area of origin in which their history can be traced.",
    "The searchers for precious stones and metals and incense-bearing trees must have scattered their beliefs far and wide when they exploited locally-unappreciated forms of wealth.",

    "In the ancient medical lore of China, as in the medical lores of other lands, there are laudatory references to “All-heal” plants and plants reputed to be specific remedies for various diseases.",
    "Not a few of these medicinal plants have been found to be either quite useless or positively harmful, but some are included in modern pharmacopœias, after having been submitted to the closest investigations of physiological science.",
    "The old herbalists, witch-doctors, and hereditary “curers”, who made some genuine discoveries that have since been elaborated, were certainly not scientists in the modern sense of the term.",
    "Their “cures” were a quaint mixture of magic and religion.",
    "They searched for those plants and substances that appeared, either by their shape or colour, to contain in more concentrated form than others the “essence of life”, the “soul substance” that restored health and promoted longevity.",
    "This “soul substance” was concentrated in body-odours and body-moistures.",
    "It was a something mixed in water which had colour, odour, and heat—a something derived from the Great Mother, who had herself sprung from water, as did the Egyptian Hathor and the Greek Aphrodite, or, if not directly from the Great Mother, from one or other of her offspring.",
    "The “soul substance” of the goddess was in vegetation; the sap of trees was identified with her blood—the “blood which is life”.",
    "Blood was one kind of body-moisture; other kinds were sweat, tears, saliva, &c.",
    "All these moistures had fertilizing properties.",
    "The Mother, as the sky-goddess, provided the world’s supply of fertilizing water.",
    "In China the supply was controlled by the dragon-gods, who caused the thunder and lightning that released the rain and flooded the rivers.",
    "Winter is the Chinese dry season.",
    "It was believed that during this period the dragons were concealed and asleep.",
    "No growth was possible during winter because of the scarcity of water—the life-giving water that caused Nature to “renew her youth” in the spring season.",
    "When the dragons awoke and rose fighting and thundering, parched wastes were soaked and fertilized by rain.",
    "Then the old, decaying world renewed her youth and fresh vegetation appeared, because “soul substance” in the form of rain had entered the soil and furnished plants with “blood-sap”, and at the same time with vital energy, vital odours, and vital colours.",
    "Thus life, which had its origin in water, was sustained by the products of water and by the properties in water.",
    "The plants that were supposed to store up most “soul substance” were those that grew in water, like the lotus, those that constantly absorbed moisture, like the “fungus of immortality”, or those that sprang up suddenly during a thunder-storm, like the “Red Cloud herb”.",
    "The latter required a heavy deluge to bring it into existence.",
    "It was a special gift of the dragon-god—or an “avatar” of that deity—and had concentrated in it the essence of much rain, and, in addition, the essence of lightning—the “fire of heaven”, ejected by the rain-dragon.",
    "The lightning was the “dragon’s tongue”, and had therefore substance, moisture, and heat, as well as brilliance.",
    "To the early thinkers the life fluid was not only blood, but warm blood—blood pulsating with the “vital spark”, the “fire of life”.",
    "These men would have accepted in the literal sense the imagery of the modern Irish poet, who wrote: O, there was lightning in my blood, Red lightning lighten’d through my blood, My Dark Rosaleen.",
    "The “fire of life” might be locked up in vegetation, in stone, or in red earth, and be made manifest by its colour alone.",
    "The genesis of this idea can be traced at a very early period in the history of modern man (Homo sapiens).",
    "In Aurignacian times in western Europe (that is, from ten till twenty thousand years ago) blood was identified with life and consciousness.",
    "The red substance in “the blood which is life” was apparently regarded as the vitalizing agency, and was supposed to be the same as red earth (red ochre).",
    "It is found, from the evidence afforded by burial customs, that the Aurignacian race originated or perpetuated the habit of smearing the bodies of their dead with red ochre.",
    "After the flesh had decayed, the red ochre fell on and coloured the bones and the pebbles around the bones.",
    "Whether or not the red ochre was supposed to be impregnated with the essence of fire, or of the sun, the source of fire, it is impossible to say.",
    "Behind the corpse-painting custom there was, no doubt, a body of definite beliefs.",
    "As much is suggested by the fact that shell-amulets and spine-amulets were laid on or about the dead.",
    "The belief that the first man had been formed of red clay mixed with water may well have been in existence in Aurignacian times.",
    "The amulets associated with Aurignacian ceremonial burials suggest, too, that ideas had been formulated regarding the after-life.",
    "Was it believed that the painted, and therefore reanimated, body would rise again, or that the soul could be assisted to travel to the Otherworld?",
    "These questions cannot yet be answered.",
    "We can do no more than note here that Colour Symbolism, and especially Red Symbolism and all it entails, had origin in remote antiquity.",
    "In China red flowers and red berries were supposed, because of their colour, to be strongly impregnated with “soul substance” or “vital essence”, or, to use the Chinese term, with shen.",
    "These flowers and berries had curative qualities.",
    "In western Europe the red holly berry was in like manner regarded as an “All-heal”.",
    "The tree on which the red berry appears is so full of divine life that it is an evergreen.",
    "In Gaelic folk-lore holly is associated with the Mother Goddess and with the water-beast (dragon) and its “avatar”, the red-spotted salmon, which is supposed to swallow the holly berries that drop into its pool.",
    "The red substance which is in the blood was not necessarily confined, however, to vegetation.",
    "As it was of the earth, earthy, or a product of some mysterious agency at work in the earth, it might be found in coagulated form as a ruby, or any other red stone, or as a stone streaked or spotted with red; it might be found in water as a shell, wholly or partly red, or as a red or yellow pearl inside a shell.",
    "It might likewise be found concentrated in the red feathers of a bird.",
    "A bird with red feathers was usually recognized as a “thunder bird”—Robin",
    "Red-breast is a European “thunder bird”",
    "[228]—and the red berry as a “thunder berry”—a berry containing the “soul substance” of the god of lightning and fire.",
    "Fire was obtained by friction from trees associated with the divine Thunderer; his spirit dwelt in the tree.",
    "One of the “fire sticks” was invariably taken from a red-berried tree.",
    "The red vital substance might likewise be displayed by a sacred fish—the “thunder fish”.",
    "In the Chinese “Boy Blue” story the thunder-dragon in human form rides on the back of a red carp.",
    "Yellow is, like red, reputed to be a vital colour.",
    "Lightning is yellow; the flames of wood fires are yellow, while the embers are red.",
    "Early man appears to have recognized the close association of yellow and red in fire.",
    "Gold is yellow, and it was connected, as a substitute for red and yellow shells, with the sun, which at morning and evening sends forth red and yellow rays.",
    "The fire which is in the sun “warms the blood” and promotes the growth of plants, as does the moisture in the moon—the moon which controls the flow of sap and blood.",
    "The combination of sun-fire, lunar-fire, and moisture, or of fire-red earth and rain, constituted, according to early man’s way of thinking, the mystery called life.",
    "Yellow berries and yellow flowers were as sacred to him, and had as great life-prolonging and curative qualities, as red berries, red flowers, red feathers, and the skins and scales of red fish.",
    "Yellow gems and yellow metals were consequently valued as highly as were red gems and red metals.",
    "In China yellow is the earth colour.",
    "In Ceylon, Burmah, Tibet, and China it is the sacred colour of the Buddhists.",
    "Blue, the sky colour, and therefore the colour of the sky-deity, was likewise holy.",
    "Torquoise and lapis-lazuli were connected with the Great Mother.",
    "The sacredness of green has a more complex history.",
    "It was not reverenced simply because of the greenness of vegetation.",
    "The mysterious substance that makes plants green was derived from the supreme source of life—the green form of the water-goddess or god—and was to be found in concentrated form in green gems and stones, including green jade.",
    "White was the colour of day, the stars, and the moon, and black the colour of night and of death, and therefore the colour of deities associated with darkness and the Otherworld.",
    "In China black is the colour of the north, of winter, and of drought.",
    "The combination of the five colours (black, white, red, yellow, and blue or green) was displayed by all deities.",
    "This conception is enshrined in the religious text which De Visser gives without comment: “A dragon in the water covers himself with five colours; Therefore he is a god.”",
    "[229] In China, as in several other countries, the colour of an animal, plant, or stone was believed to reveal its character and attributes.",
    "A red berry was regarded with favour, because it displayed the life colour.",
    "A red stone was favoured for the same reason.",
    "When it is nowadays found that some particular berry or herb, favoured of old as an “All-heal”, is really an efficacious medicine, an enthusiast may incline to regard it as a wonderful thing that modern medical science has not achieved, in some lines, greater triumphs than were achieved by the “simple observers” of ancient times.",
    "But it may be that the real cures were of accidental discovery, and that the effective berry or herb would, on account of its colour alone, have continued in use whether it had cured or not.",
    "In China not only the berry with a “good colour” was used by “curers”, but even the stone with a “good colour”.",
    "The physicians, for instance, sometimes prescribed ground jade, and we read of men who died, because, as it was thought, the quantities of jade-medicine taken were much too large.",
    "Some ancient writers assert, in this connection, that although a dose of ground jade may bring this life to a speedy end, it will ensure prolonged life in the next world.",
    "The berries and stones which were reputed to be “All-heals” were not always devoured.",
    "They could be used simply as charms.",
    "The vital essence or “soul substance” in berry or stone was supposed to be so powerful that it warded off the attacks of the demons of disease, or expelled the demons after they had taken possession of a patient.",
    "Medicines might be prepared by simply dipping the charms into pure well water.",
    "These charms were often worn as body-ornaments.",
    "All the ancient personal ornaments were magic charms that gave protection or regulated the functions of body organs.",
    "When symbols were carved on jade, the ornaments were believed to acquire increased effectiveness.",
    "Gold ornaments were invariably given symbolic shape.",
    "Like the horse-shoe, which in western Europe is nailed on a door for “luck”—that is, to ward off evil—these symbolic ornaments were credited with luck-bringing virtues.",
    "The most ancient gold ornaments in the world are found in Egypt, and these are models of shells, which had been worn as “luck-bringers” long before gold was worked.",
    "[230] These shells had an intimate association with the Mother Goddess, who, in one of her aspects, personified the birth-aiding and fertilizing shell.",
    "The idea that the coloured fruits and the coloured stones were life-giving “avatars” of the Mother Goddess is well illustrated in the glowing accounts of the Chinese Paradise.",
    "The Tree of Life might bear fruit or gems.",
    "The souls swallowed gems as readily as fruit.",
    "In the Japanese Paradise the immortals devour powdered mother-of-pearl shells as well as peaches, dried cassia pods, cinnabar, pine needles, or pine cones.",
    "Jade was connected with vegetation on this earth as well as in Paradise.",
    "As we have seen, the Great Mother goddess created this famous mineral for the benefit of mankind.",
    "It contained her “soul substance”, as did the trees, their blossoms, and their fruit, and even their leaves and bark.",
    "This quaint belief is enshrined in the following quotation from the Illustrated Mirror of Jades, translated by Laufer and given without comment: “In the second month, the plants in the mountains receive a bright lustre.",
    "When their leaves fall, they change into jade.",
    "The spirit of jade is like a beautiful woman.”",
    "[231] It is obvious that the “beautiful woman” is the Goddess of the West.",
    "Reference to coral trees in Paradise are numerous.",
    "It was believed not only in China but in western Europe, until comparatively recent times, that coral was a marine tree—the tree of the water-goddess.",
    "The Great Mother was connected with the water above and beyond the firmament, as well as the rivers and the sea.",
    "“Good health” in the Otherworld was immortality or great longevity.",
    "A soul which ate of a peach from the World Tree was assured of 3000 years of good health.",
    "He renewed his youth, and never grew old, so long as the supply of peaches was assured.",
    "[232] In China men lengthened their days by partaking of “soul substance” in various forms.",
    "The pine-tree cult made decoctions of pine needles and cones, or of the fungus found at the roots of pines.",
    "“The juice of the pine”, says one Chinese sage, “when consumed for a long time, renders the body light, prevents man from growing old, and lengthens his life.",
    "Its leaves preserve the interior of the body; they cause a man never to feel hunger, and increase the years of his life.”",
    "The cypress was also favoured.",
    "“Cypress seeds,” the same writer asserts, “if consumed for a long period, render a man hale and healthy.",
    "They endow him with a good colour, sharpen his ears and eyes, cause him never to experience the feeling of hunger, nor to grow old.”",
    "The camphor tree comes next to the pine and cypress as “a dispenser and depository of vital power”.",
    "[233] Apparently the fact that pines and cypresses are evergreens recommended them to the Chinese, although it was not for that reason only the belief arose about their richness of “soul substance”.",
    "An ancient Chinese sage has declared: “Pines and cypresses alone on this earth are endowed with life, in the midst of winter as well as in summer they are evergreen.",
    "Pines 1000 years old resemble a blue ox, a blue dog, or a blue human being.",
    "Cypresses 1000 years old have deep roots shaped like men in a sitting posture....",
    "When they are cut they lose blood....",
    "Branches of pines which are 3000 years old have underneath the bark accumulations of resin in the shape of dragons, which, if pounded and consumed in a quantity of full ten pounds, will enable a man to live 500 years.”",
    "[234] Here we have the tree connected with the blue dragon.",
    "As has been stated, ancient pines were transformed into dragons.",
    "The assertion that the pines and cypresses were the only trees possessed of “vital power” does not accord with the evidence regarding the peach-tree cult.",
    "The peach, although not an evergreen, was credited with being possessed of much “soul substance”.",
    "No doubt the ideas connected with evergreens had a close association with the doctrines of colour symbolism.",
    "The Chinese “Tree of Heaven” (Ailanthus glandulosa) appears to have attracted special attention, because in spring its leaves are coloured reddish-violet or reddish-brown before they turn green.",
    "The walnut, cherry, and peony similarly show reddish young leaves, and these trees have much lore connected with them.",
    "One seems to detect traces of the beliefs connected with the mandrake in the reference to the human-shaped roots of the 1000-year-old cypress tree.",
    "The mandrake was the plant of Aphrodite, and its root, which resembles the human form, was used medicinally; it has narcotic properties, and was believed also to be a medicine which promoted fertility, assisted birth, and caused youths and girls to fall in love with one another.",
    "According to mandrake-lore, the plant shrieks when taken from the earth, and causes the death of the one who plucks it.",
    "[235] Dogs were consequently employed to drag it out of the ground, and they expired immediately.",
    "The “mandrake apple” is believed by Dr. Rendel Harris to have been the original “love apple”.",
    "[236] In like manner the mugwort, the plant of Artemis, was connected in China and Japan with the pine which had virtues similar to those of the herb.",
    "Although the mandrake-dog is not associated with the cypress, it is found connected in a Japanese folk-story with the pine.",
    "The hero of the tale, an old man called Hana Saka Jijii, acquired the secret how to make withered trees blossom.",
    "He possessed a wonderful dog, named Shiro, which one day attracted his attention by sniffing, barking, and wagging his tail at a certain spot in the cottage garden.",
    "The old man was puzzled to know what curious thing in the ground attracted the dog, and began to dig.",
    "After turning up a few spadefuls of earth he found a hoard of gold and silver pieces.",
    "A jealous neighbour, having observed what had happened, borrowed Shiro and set the animal to search for treasure in his own garden.",
    "The dog began to sniff and bark at a certain spot, but when the man turned over the soil, he found only dirt and offal that emitted an offensive smell.",
    "Angry at being deceived by the dog, he killed it and buried the body below the roots of a pine tree.",
    "Hana Saka Jijii was much distressed on account of the loss of Shiro.",
    "He burned incense below the pine tree, laid flowers on the dog’s grave, and shed tears.",
    "That night he dreamed a wonderful dream.",
    "The ghost of Shiro appeared before him, and, addressing him, said: “Cut down the pine tree above my grave and make a rice mortar of it.",
    "When you use the mortar think of me.”",
    "The old man did as the dog advised, and discovered to his great joy that when he used the pine-tree mortar each grain of rice was transformed into pure gold.",
    "He soon became rich.",
    "The envious neighbour discovered what was going on and borrowed the mortar.",
    "In his hands, however, it turned rice into dirt.",
    "This enraged him so greatly that he broke the mortar and burned it.",
    "That night the ghost of Shiro appeared once again in a dream, and advised Hana Saka Jijii to collect the ashes of the burnt mortar and scatter them on withered trees.",
    "Next morning he did as the dog advised him.",
    "To his astonishment he found that the ashes caused withered trees to come to life and send forth fresh and beautiful blossoms.",
    "He then went about the country and employed himself reviving dead plum and cherry trees, and soon became so renowned that a prince sent for him, asking that he should bring back to life the withered trees in his garden.",
    "The old man received a rich reward when he accomplished the feat.",
    "The jealous neighbour came to know how Hana Saka Jijii revived dead trees, so he collected what remained of the ashes of the pine-tree mortar.",
    "Then he set forth to proclaim to the inhabitants of a royal town that he could work the same miracle as Hana Saka Jijii.",
    "The prince sent for him, and the man climbed into the branches of a withered tree.",
    "But when he scattered the ashes no bud or blossom appeared, and the wind blew the dust into the eyes of the prince and nearly blinded him.",
    "The impostor was seized and soundly beaten; and the dog Shiro was, in this manner, well avenged.",
    "In this story the dog is a searcher for and giver of treasure.",
    "It is of special interest, therefore, to find that Artemis, the mugwort-goddess of the West, “was not only the opener of treasure-houses, but she also possessed the secret of the Philosopher’s Stone; she could transmute base substances into gold”.",
    "She could therefore grant riches to those whom she favoured.",
    "Dr. Rendel Harris, quoting from an old English writer, records the belief “that upon St. John’s eve there are coals (which turn to gold) to be found at midday under the roots of mugwort, which after or before that time are very small, or none at all”.",
    "The gold cures sickness.",
    "[237] A similar belief was attached to the mandrake.",
    "A French story tells of a peasant who regularly “fed” a mandrake that grew below a mistletoe-bearing oak.",
    "The mandrake, when fed, would, it was believed, “make you rich by returning twice as much as you spent upon it....",
    "The plant had become an animal.”",
    "[238] If Shiro’s prototype was the mandrake-dog which sacrificed itself for the sake of lovers, and was itself an “avatar” of the deity, we should expect to find the pine tree connected with the love-goddess.",
    "[239] Joly, in his Legend in Japanese Art (p. 147), tells that “at Takasago there is a very old pine tree, the trunk of which is bifurcated; in it dwells the spirit of the Maiden of Takasago, who was seen once by the son of Izanagi, who fell in love and wedded her.",
    "Both lived to a very great age, dying at the same hour on the same day, and since then their spirits abide in the tree, but on moonlight nights they return to human shape and revisit the scene of their earthly life and pursue their work of gathering pine needles.”",
    "The needles were promoters of longevity, as we have seen.",
    "Another Japanese pair associated with the pine trees are Jo and Uba, a couple of old and wrinkled spirits.",
    "They gathered pine needles, Jo using a rake and Uba a besom and fan.",
    "The goddess of the pine was evidently a Far Eastern Aphrodite, as well as a Far Eastern Artemis—an Artemis who provided medicine for women in the form of the mugwort, was a goddess of birth, a guardian of treasure, and a goddess of travellers and hunters.",
    "The Romans associated with Diana (Artemis) her loved one, Dianus or Janus, [240] as the tree-goddess in Japan was associated with a deified human lover.",
    "The pine may have been “a kind of mugwort” (and apparently, like the cypress, a “kind of mandrake”), but it did not displace the mugwort as a medicinal plant.",
    "Dr. Rendel Harris quotes a letter from Professor Giles, the distinguished Chinese scholar, who says: “There is quite a literature about Artemisia vulgaris, L. (the mugwort), which has been used in China from time immemorial for cauterizing as a counter-irritant, especially in cases of gout.",
    "Other species of Artemisia are also found in China.”",
    "[241] The Far Eastern Artemis appears to be represented by the immortal lady known in China as Ho Sien Ku, and in Japan as Kasenko.",
    "She is shown “as a young woman clothed in mugwort, holding a lotus stem and flower” (like a western Asiatic or Egyptian goddess), “and talking to a phœnix”, or “depicted carrying a basket of loquat fruits which she gathered for her sick mother.",
    "She was a woman who, having been promised immortality in a dream, fed on mother-of-pearl, and thereafter moved as swiftly as a bird.”",
    "[242] The Mexican god Tlaloc’s wife was similarly a mugwort goddess.",
    "In the pine-tree story the Japanese representative of the tree- and lunar-goddess of love appears with her spouse on moonlight nights.",
    "The moon was the “Pearl of Heaven”.",
    "It will be noted that the mugwort is connected with pearl-shell—the lady Ho Sien Ku having acquired the right to wear mugwort, in her character as an immortal, by eating mother-of-pearl.",
    "This connection of pearl-shell with a medicinal plant is a more arbitrary one than that of the mugwort with the pine, or the mandrake with the cypress.",
    "The lotus was a form of the ancient love-goddess, as was also the cowry.",
    "In Egypt the solar-god Horus emerges at birth from the lotus-form of Hathor as it floats on the breast of the Nile.",
    "Ho Sien Ku’s basket of fruit is also symbolic.",
    "“A basket of sycamore figs” was in Ancient Egypt “originally the hieroglyphic sign for a woman, a goddess, or a mother”.",
    "It had thus the same significance as the Pot, the lotus, the mandrake-apple, and the pomegranate.",
    "The latter symbol supplanted the Egyptian lotus in the Ægean area.",
    "[243] Mugwort, as already stated, was a medicine, and chiefly a woman’s medicine.",
    "“The plant (mugwort)”, says Dr. Rendel Harris, “is Artemis, and Artemis is the plant.",
    "Artemis is a woman’s goddess and a maid’s goddess, because she was a woman’s medicine and a maid’s medicine.”",
    "[244] The mugwort promoted child-birth, and controlled women like the moon, and was used for women’s ailments in general.",
    "It was a healing plant, and was “good for gout” among other troubles.",
    "The women’s herb in China is called the “san tsi”.",
    "An eighteenth-century writer [245] says it is “efficacious in women’s disorders and hæmorrhages of all sorts”.",
    "It is found “only on the tops of high, steep mountains”, as is the scented Edelraut (Artemisia mutellina) an alpine plant like the famous and beautiful Edelweiss.",
    "Continuing his account of the “san tsi” herb, the eighteenth-century writer and compiler says: “A kind of goat of a greyish colour is very fond of feeding upon this plant, insomuch that they (the Chinese) imagine the blood of this animal is endowed with the same medicinal properties.",
    "It is certain that the blood of these goats has surprising success against the injuries received by falls from horses, and other accidents of the same kind.",
    "This the missionaries have had experience of several times.",
    "One of their servants that was thrown by a vicious horse, and who lay some time without speech or motion, was so soon recovered by this remedy that the next day he was able to pursue his journey.”",
    "It is also “a specific against the smallpox”.",
    "The author of The Chinese Traveller, touching again on the blood substitute for this plant, which is “not easy to be had”, says: “In the experiments above mentioned, the blood of a goat was made use of that had been taken by hunters”.",
    "The goat appears to be the link between Artemis “the curer” and Artemis as “Diana the huntress”.",
    "As the virtues of rare curative herbs passed into the blood of animals who ate them, the goddess, like her worshippers, hunted the animals in question, or became their protector.",
    "Pliny, in his twenty-eighth book, having, as Dr. Rendel Harris notes, “exhausted the herbals”, shows that “a larger medicine is to be found in animals and in man”.",
    "[246] In China the stag or deer, the stork, and the tortoise are associated with the Tree of Life as “emblems of longevity”.",
    "One is reminded in this connection of the Western, Eastern, and Far Eastern legends about birds that pluck and carry to human beings leaves of “the plant of life” or “fungus of immortality”, and of Mykenæan and Ancient Egyptian representations of bulls, goats, deer, &c., browsing on vines and other trees or bushes that were supposed to contain the elixir of life, being sacred to the goddess and shown as symbols of her or of the god with whom she was associated as mother or spouse.",
    "Another famous Far Eastern curative “wort” is the ginseng.",
    "Like the fungus of immortality, it grew on one of the Islands of the Blest.",
    "Taken with mermaid’s flesh, it was supposed to lengthen the life of man for several centuries.",
    "“As described by Father Jartoux”, says the eighteenth-century English writer, already quoted, [247] “it has a white root, somewhat knotty, about half as thick as one’s little finger; and as it frequently parts into two branches, not unlike the forked parts of a man, it is said from thence to have obtained the name of ginseng, which implies a resemblance of the human form, though indeed it has no more of such a likeness than is usual among other roots.",
    "From the root arises a perfectly smooth and roundish stem, of a pretty deep-red colour, except towards the surface of the ground, where it is somewhat whiter.",
    "At the top of the stem is a sort of joint or knot, formed by the shooting out of four branches, sometimes more, sometimes less, which spread as from a centre.",
    "The colour of the branches underneath is green, with a whitish mixture, and the upper part is of a deep red like the stem....",
    "Each branch has five leaves,” and the leaves “make a circular figure nearly parallel to the surface of the earth”.",
    "The berries are of “a beautiful red colour”.",
    "Here we have hints of the mandrake without a doubt.",
    "As a matter of fact, the ginseng has been identified with the mandrake.",
    "The plant evidently attracted attention because of its colours and form.",
    "As it has a red stem and red berries, it is not surprising to learn that “it strengthens the vital spirits, is good against dizziness in the head and dimness of sight, and prolongs life to extreme old age”, and that “those who are in health often use it to render themselves more strong and vigorous”.",
    "The four-leaved ginseng, like the four-leaved clover, was apparently a symbol of the four cardinal points.",
    "Its “five leaves” and the “circular figure formed by them” must have attracted those who selected five colours for their gods and adored the sun.",
    "The ginseng is found “on the declivities of mountains covered with thick forests, upon the banks of torrents or about the roots of trees, and amidst a thousand other different forms of vegetables”.",
    "Conflicts took place between Tartars and Chinese for possession of the ginseng, and one Tartar king had “the whole province where the ginseng grows encompassed by wooden palisades”.",
    "Guards patrolled about “to hinder the Chinese from searching for it (ginseng)”.",
    "Tea first came into use in China as a life-prolonger.",
    "The shrub is an evergreen, and appears to have attracted the attention of the Chinese herbalists on that account.",
    "Our eighteenth-century writer says: “As to the properties of tea, they are very much controverted by our physicians; but the Chinese reckon it an excellent diluter and purifier of the blood, a great strengthener of the brain and stomach, a promoter of digestion, perspiration, and cleanser of the veins and urethra”.",
    "Large quantities of tea were in China given “in fevers and some sorts of colics”.",
    "Our author adds: “That the gout and stone are unknown in China is ascribed to the use of this plant”.",
    "[248] Apparently we owe not only some valuable medicines, but even the familiar cup of tea, to the ancient searchers for the elixir of life and curative herbs.",
    "Intoxicating liquors (aqua vitæ, i.e. “water of life”) have a similar history.",
    "They were supposed to impart vigour to the body and prolong life.",
    "Withal, like the intoxicating “soma”, drunk by Aryo-Indian priests, they had a religious value as they produced “prophetic states”.",
    "Even the opium habit had a religious origin.",
    "Aqua vitæ was impregnated with “soul substance”, as was the juice of grapes, or, as the Hebrews put it, “the blood of grapes”.",
    "[249] As Far Eastern beliefs associated with curative plants and curative stones (like jade) have filtered westward, so did Western beliefs filter eastward.",
    "Dr. Rendel Harris has shown that myths and beliefs connected with the ivy and mugwort, which were so prevalent in Ancient Greece, can be traced across Siberia to Kamschatka.",
    "The Ainus of Japan regard the mistletoe as an “All-heal”, as did the ancient Europeans.",
    "“The discovery of the primitive sanctity of ivy, mugwort, and mistletoe”, says Dr. Harris, “makes a strong link between the early Greeks and other early peoples both East and West, and it is probable that we shall find many more contacts between peoples that, as far as geography and culture go, are altogether remote.”",
    "[250] There are many Far Eastern stories about men and women who have escaped threatened death by eating herbs, or pine resin, or some magic fruit.",
    "One herb, called huchu, was first discovered to have special virtues by a man who, when crossing a mountain, fell into a deep declivity and was unable to get out of it, not only on account of the injuries he had sustained, but because the rocks were as smooth as glass.",
    "He looked about for something to eat, and saw only the huchu herb.",
    "Plucking it out of the thin soil in which it grew, he chewed the root and found that it kept his body at a temperature which prevented him feeling cold, while it also satisfied his desire for food and water.",
    "Time passed quickly and pleasantly.",
    "He felt happy, slept well, and did not weary.",
    "One day the earth was shaken by a great earthquake that opened a way of escape for him.",
    "The man at once left his mountain prison and set off for home.",
    "On reaching his house he found, to his surprise, that it was inhabited by strangers.",
    "He spoke to them, asking why they were there, and inquiring regarding his wife and children.",
    "The strangers only scoffed at him.",
    "Then he wandered through the village, searching for old friends, but could not find one.",
    "He, however, interested a wise old man in his case.",
    "An examination was made of the family annals, and it was discovered that the name given by the man had been recorded three centuries earlier as that of a member of the family who had mysteriously disappeared.",
    "The Chinese Rip Van Winkle then told the story of his life in the mountain cavity, and how he had been sustained by the huchu herb.",
    "In this manner, according to Chinese tradition, the discovery was made that the herb “prolongs life, cures baldness, turns grey hair black again, and tends to renew one’s youth”.",
    "Great quantities of huchu tea must be drunk for a considerable time, and no other food taken, if the desired results are to be fully achieved.",
    "Other Rip Van Winkle stories tell of men who have lived for centuries while conversing with immortals met by chance, or while taking part in their amusements like the men in Western European stories, who enter fairy knolls and dance with fairy women, and think they have danced for a single hour, but find, when they come out, that a whole year has gone past.",
    "One day a Taoist priest, named Wang Chih, entered a mountain forest to gather firewood.",
    "He came to a cave in which sat two aged men playing chess, while others looked on.",
    "The game fascinated Wang Chih, so he entered the cave, laid aside his chopper, and looked on.",
    "When he began to feel hungry and thirsty he moved as if to rise up and go away, although the game had not come to an end.",
    "One of the spectators, however, divining his intention, handed him a kernel, which looked like a date stone, saying, “Suck that”.",
    "Wang Chih put the kernel in his mouth and found that it refreshed him so that he experienced no further desire for food or drink.",
    "The chess-playing continued in silence, and several hours, as it seemed, flew past.",
    "Then one of the old men spoke to Wang Chih, saying: “It is now a long time since you came to join our company.",
    "I think you should return home.”",
    "Wang Chih rose to his feet.",
    "When he grasped his chopper he was astonished to find that the handle crumbled to dust.",
    "On reaching home, he discovered, like the man who fed on the huchu herb, that he had been missing for one or two centuries.",
    "The old men with whom he had mingled in the cave were the immortals, known to the Chinese as Sten Nung, to the Japanese as Sennin, and to the Indians as Rishis—a class of demi-gods who once lived on earth and achieved great merit, in the spiritual sense, by practising austerities in solitude and for long periods.",
    "The reference to the date stone is of special interest.",
    "In Babylonia and Assyria the date palm was one of the holy trees.",
    "It was cultivated in southern Persia, and may have been introduced into China from that quarter.",
    "Another possibility is that the seeds were got from dates carried by Arab traders to China, or obtained from Arabs by Chinese traders.",
    "One of the Chinese names for the date resembles the Ancient Egyptian designation, bunnu.",
    "Laufer, who discusses this problem, [251] refers to early Chinese texts that make mention of Mo-lin, a distant country in which dark-complexioned natives subsist on dates.",
    "Mo-lin, earlier Mwa-lin, is, Laufer thinks, “intended for the Malindi of Edrīsī or Mulanda of Yãqūt, now Malindi, south of the Equator, in Seyidieh Province of British East Africa”.",
    "The lore connected with other Trees of Life in China appears to have been transferred to the imported date palm.",
    "One of its names is “jujube of a thousand years”, or “jujube of ten thousand years”.",
    "Laufer quotes a Chinese description of the date palm which emphasizes the fact that it “remains ever green”, and tells that “when the kernel ripens, the seeds are black.",
    "In their appearance they resemble dried jujubes.",
    "They are good to eat, and as sweet as candy.”",
    "[252] Another Chinese Rip Van Winkle story relates that two men who wandered among the mountains met two pretty girls.",
    "They were entertained by them, and fed on a concoction prepared from hemp.",
    "Seven generations went past while they enjoyed the company of the girls.",
    "The hemp (old Persian and Sanskrit bangha) was cultivated at a remote period in China and Iran.",
    "A drug prepared from the seed is supposed to prolong life and to inspire those who partake of it to prophesy, after seeing visions and dreaming dreams.",
    "The “bang” habit is as bad as the opium habit.",
    "In the tree-lore of China there are interesting links between trees and stones.",
    "It has been shown that jade was an “avatar” of the mother-goddess, who created it for the benefit of mankind; that tree foliage was identified with jade; that dragons were born from stones; certain coloured stones were “dragon eggs”, the eggs of the “Dragon Mother”, the mother-goddess herself, who had “many forms and many colours”.",
    "Sacred stones were supposed to have dropped from the sky, or to have grown in the earth.",
    "Pliny refers to a stone that fell from the sun.",
    "In Ancient Egypt it was believed that the creative or fertilizing tears of the beneficent deities, like those of Osiris and Isis, caused good shrubs to spring up, and that the tears of a deity like Set, who became the personification of evil, produced poisonous plants.",
    "The weeping Prajapati of the Aryo-Indians resembles the weeping sun-god Ra of Egypt.",
    "At the beginning, Prajapati’s tears fell into the water and “became the air”, and the tears he “wiped away, upwards, became the sky”.",
    "[253] It is evident that the idea of the weeping deity reached China, for there are references to “tree tears” and to “stone tears”.",
    "Both the tree and stone “avatars” of the Great Mother or Great Father shed creative tears.",
    "The Chinese appear to have discovered their wonderful “weeping tree” in Turkestan in the second century B.C., but the beliefs connected with it were evidently of greater antiquity.",
    "They already knew about the weeping deities who created good and baneful vegetation, and the discovery of the tree, it would appear, simply afforded proof to them of the truth of their beliefs.",
    "The tree in question (the hu tʼun tree) has been identified by Laufer as the balsam poplar.",
    "“This tree”, he quotes from a Chinese commentator, “is punctured by insects, whereupon flows down a juice, that is commonly termed hu tʼun lei (‘hu tʼun tears’), because it is said to resemble human tears.",
    "When this substance penetrates earth or stone it coagulates into a solid mass, somewhat on the order of rock salt.”",
    "Laufer notes that Pliny “speaks of a thorny shrub in Ariana, on the borders of India, valuable for its tears, resembling the myrrh, but difficult of access on account of the adhering thorns.",
    "It is not known what plant is to be understood by the Plinian text; but the analogy of the tears,” comments Laufer, “with the above Chinese term is noteworthy.”",
    "An ancient Chinese scholar, dealing with the references to the weeping trees, says that “its sap sinks into the earth, and is similar to earth and stone.",
    "It is used as a dye, like the ginger stone” (a variety of stalactite).",
    "Ta Min, who lived in the tenth century of our era, wrote regarding the tree, “There are two kinds—a tree sap, which is not employed in the Pharmacopœia, and a stone sap collected on the surface of stones; this one only is utilized as medicine.",
    "It resembles in appearance small pieces of stone, and those coloured like loess take the first place.",
    "The latter was employed as a remedy for toothache.”",
    "[254] In Babylonia toothache was supposed to be caused by the marsh-worm demon which devours “the blood of the teeth” and “destroys the strength of the gums”.",
    "The god Ea smites the worm, which is a form of the dragon Tiamat.",
    "[255] The antique conception enshrined in the “weeping tree” is that the mother-goddess of the sky sheds tears, which cause the tree to grow, and that, as the tree, she sheds tears that become stones, while the stones shed tears that provide soul substance to cure disease by removing pain and promoting health.",
    "In Egypt the stone specially sacred to the sky-goddess Hathor was the turquoise, in which was, apparently, concentrated the vital essence or “soul substance” of the sky.",
    "The goddess sprang from water, and her tears were drops of the primeval water from which all things that are issued forth.",
    "Those stones that contained water were in China “dragon stones” or “dragon eggs”.",
    "In various countries there are legends about deities, and men and women have sprung from moisture-shedding stones.",
    "The mother-goddess of Scotland, who presides over the winter season, transforms herself at the beginning of summer into a stone that is often seen to be covered with moisture.",
    "In Norse mythology the earliest gods spring from stones that have been licked by the primeval mother-cow.",
    "Mithra of Persia sprang from a rock.",
    "Indonesian beliefs regarding moist stones, from which issue water and human beings, are fairly common.",
    "[256] The Kayan of Sumatra are familiar with the beliefs that connect stones and vegetables with the sky and water.",
    "They say that “in the beginning there was a rock.",
    "On this rain fell and gave rise to moss, and the worms, aided by the dung beetles, made soil by their castings.",
    "Then a sword handle came down from the sun and became a large tree.",
    "From the moon came a creeper which, hanging from the tree, mated through the action of the wind.”",
    "From this union of tree and creeper, i.e. sun and moon, “the first men were produced”.",
    "[257] The connection between sky, plant, and animals is found in the lore regarding the Chinese sant si mountain herb which is eaten by goats.",
    "This herb, like other herbs, is produced from the body-moisture of the goddess; it is the goddess herself—the goddess who sprang from water.",
    "The plant is guarded by the mountain goat as the pearls are guarded by the shark, and the goat, which browses on the plant, is, like the shark, an avatar of the goddess.",
    "Goat’s blood is therefore as efficacious as the sap of the herb.",
    "The goat or ram is the vehicle of the Indian fire and lightning god Agni; the Norse god Thor has a car drawn by goats.",
    "Dionysos, as Bromios (the Thunderer), has a goat “avatar”, too, and he is the god of wine (Bacchus)—the wine, the “blood of grapes”, being the elixir of life.",
    "Osiris, who had a ram form, was to the Ancient Egyptians “Lord of the Overflowing Wine”.",
    "European witches ride naked on goats or on brooms; the devil had a goat form.",
    "In China, as has been shown, the dragon-herb, peach, vine, pine, fungus of immortality, ginseng, &c., received their sap, or blood, or “soul substance” from rain released by dragon gods, who thundered like Bromios-Dionysos.",
    "The inexhaustible pot from which life-giving water came was in the moon.",
    "This Pot was the mother-goddess, who had a star form.",
    "A fertilizing tear from the goddess-star, which falls on the “Night of the Drop”, is still supposed in Egypt to cause the Nile to rise in flood.",
    "We should expect to find the Chinese mythological cycle completed by an arbitrary connection between the goat or ram and sacred stones.",
    "There are, to begin with, celestial goats.",
    "Some of the Far Eastern demi-gods, already referred to, ride through “Cloud-land” on the backs of goats or sheep.",
    "One of the eight demi-gods, who personify the eight points of the compass, is called by the Chinese Hwang Chʼu-Pʼing, and by the Japanese Koshohei.",
    "He is said to be an incarnation of the “rain-priest”, Chʼih Sung Tze, who has for his wife a daughter of the Royal Mother of the West, the mother-goddess of the Peach Tree of Life.",
    "The Japanese version of the legend of the famous Koshohei is given by Joly as follows: “Koshohei, when fifteen years old, led his herd of goats to the Kin Hwa mountains, and, having found a grotto, stayed there for forty years in meditation.",
    "His brother, Shoki, was a priest, and he vowed to find the missing shepherd.",
    "Once he walked near the mountain and he was told of the recluse by a sage named Zenju, and set out to find him.",
    "He recognized his brother, but expressed his astonishment at the absence of sheep or goats.",
    "Koshohei thereupon touched with his staff the white stones with which the ground was strewn, and as he touched them they became alive in the shape of goats.”",
    "[258] Goats might become stones.",
    "The Great Mother was a stone, rock, or mountain, having the power to assume many forms, because she was the life of all things and the substance of all things.",
    "The goddess was the Mountain of Dawn in labour that brought forth the mouse-form of the sun (Smintheus Apollo), or the antelope form of the sun, or the hawk or eagle form, or the human form, or the egg containing the sun-god.",
    "She was also the sun-boat—the dragon-ship of the sun.",
    "The five holy mountains of China appear to have been originally connected with the goddess and her sons—the gods of the four quarters.",
    "In China deities might on occasion take the form of stones or reptiles.",
    "During the Chou Dynasty (756 B.C.) “one of the feudal dukes”, says Giles, “saw a vision of a yellow serpent which descended from heaven, and laid its head on the slope of a mountain.",
    "The duke spoke of this to his astrologer, who said, ‘It is a manifestation of God; sacrifice to it’.",
    "In 747 B.C. another duke found on a mountain a being in the semblance of a stone.",
    "Sacrifices were at once offered, and the stone was deified and received regular worship from that time forward.”",
    "[259] Giles states further in connection with Chinese god-stones: “Under 532 B.C. we have the record of a stone speaking.”",
    "The Marquis Lu inquired of his chief musician if this was a fact, and received the following answer: “Stones cannot speak.",
    "Perhaps this one was possessed by a spirit.",
    "If not, the people must have heard wrong.",
    "And yet it is said that when things are done out of season and discontents and complaints are stirring among the people, then speechless things do speak.”",
    "[260] Precious stones were, like boulders or mountains, linked with the Great Mother.",
    "In Egypt the red jaspar amulet, called “the girdle of Isis”, was supposed to be a precious drop of the life-blood of that goddess.",
    "Herbs were connected with precious stones, and were credited with the attributes and characteristics of these stones.",
    "There are many references in Chinese, Indian, and other texts and folk-lores to gems that gleam in darkness.",
    "No gems do.",
    "The mandrake was similarly believed to shine at night.",
    "Both gem and herb were associated with the moon, a form of the mother-goddess, and were supposed to give forth light like the moon, [261] just as stones associated with the rain-mother were supposed to become moist, or to send forth a stream of water, or to shed tears like the “weeping trees”, and like the sky from which drop rain and dew.",
    "The attributes of the goddess were shared by her “avatars”.",
    "The amount or strength of the “soul-substance” in trees, herbs, well-water, stones, and animals varied greatly.",
    "Some elixirs derived from one or other of these “avatars” might prolong life by a few years; other elixirs might ensure many years of health.",
    "The difference between a medicinal herb and the herb of immortality was one of degree in potency.",
    "The former was imbued with sufficient “soul-substance” to cure a patient suffering from a disease, or to give good health for months, or even years; the latter gave extremely good health, and those who partook of it lived for long periods in the Otherworld.",
    "Even the “spiritual beings” (ling) of China were graded.",
    "The four ling, as De Visser states, are “the unicorn, the phœnix, the tortoise, and the dragon”.",
    "The dragon is credited with being possessed of “most ling of all creatures”.",
    "[262] Stones were likewise graded.",
    "Precious stones had more ling than ordinary stones.",
    "Precious stones are sometimes referred to as pi-si.",
    "One Chinese writer says that “the best pi-si are deep-red in colour; that those in which purple, yellow, and green are combined, and the white ones take the second place; while those half white and half black are of the third grade”.",
    "[263] Stones that displayed five colours combined apparently all the virtues of the five deities—the gods of the four quarters, and the sun, their chief.",
    "These were all children of the sixth deity, the Great Mother, who was the water on earth and the water above the firmament and the moon.",
    "The moon contained, as has been said, the “Pot” of fertilizing water which created all the water that flows into the Earth “Pot”.",
    "In China, as in Egypt and Western Europe, the Great Mother was the reproductive principle in Nature, the source of the moisture of life, the blood which is life, the sap of trees, the soul-substance in herbs, in fruit, in pearls, and in precious stones and precious metals—precious because of their close association with her.",
    "It was the human dread of death and pain, the human desire for health and long life, and for the renewal of youth that instigated early man to search for the well of life, the plant of life, the curative herb, the pearl, and precious stones and precious metals.",
    "But before the search began, the complex ideas about the origin of life and the means by which it might be prolonged, which are reviewed in this chapter, passed through a long process of development in the most ancient centres of civilization.",
    "In China we meet not only with primitive ideas regarding life-giving food and water, but with ideas that had gradually developed for centuries outside China after the earliest attempts had been made to reanimate the corpse, not merely by painting it, but by preventing the body from decaying.",
    "In the history of mummification in Egypt may be found the history of complex beliefs that travelled far and wide.",
    "[264] Even those peoples who did not adopt, or, at any rate, perpetuate the custom of mummification, adopted the belief that it was necessary to preserve the corpse.",
    "This belief is still prevalent in China, as will be shown, but magic takes the place of surgery.",
    "In the next chapter evidence will be provided to indicate how the overland “drift” of culture towards China was impelled by the forces at work in Babylonia and Egypt.",

    "The persistent and enterprising search for wealth in ancient times, which, as will be shown in this chapter, had so much to do with the spread of civilization, may seem quite a natural thing to modern man.",
    "But it is really as remarkable, when we consider the circumstances, to find the early peoples possessed of the greed of gold as it would be to find hungry men who have been ship-wrecked on a lonely island more concerned about its mineral resources than the food and water they were absolutely in need of.",
    "What was the good of gold in an ancient civilization that had no coinage?",
    "What attraction could it possibly hold for desert nomads?",
    "The value attached to gold, which is a comparatively useless metal, has always been a fictitious value.",
    "As we have seen, it became precious in ancient times, not because of its purchasing power, but for the reason that it had religious associations.",
    "The early peoples regarded the precious metal as an “avatar” of the life-giving and life-sustaining Great Mother goddess—the “Golden Hathor”, the “Golden Aphrodite”.",
    "In Egypt, Babylonia, Greece, India, and China the cow- and sky-goddess, the source of fertilizing water, was, in the literal sense, a goddess of gold.",
    "In India one of the five Sanskrit names for gold is Chandra",
    "[265] (“the moon”), and the Indus was called “Golden Stream”, not merely because gold was found in its sand, but because of its connection with the celestials.",
    "“Gold is the object of the wishes of the Vedic singer, and golden treasures are mentioned as given by patrons, along with cows and horses.",
    "Gold was used for ornaments for neck and breast, for ear-rings, and even for cups.",
    "Gold is always associated with the gods.",
    "All that is connected with them is of gold; the horses of the sun are ‘gold skinned’, and so on.”",
    "This summary by two distinguished Sanskrit scholars emphasizes the close connection that existed in India between gold and gold ornaments and religious beliefs.",
    "[266] “Gold”, a reader may contend, “is, of course, a beautiful metal, and the ancients may well have been attracted by its beauty when they began to utilize it for ornaments.”",
    "But is there any proof that ornaments were adopted, because, in the first place, they made appeal to the æsthetic sense, which, after all, is a cultivated sense, and not to be entirely divorced from certain mental leanings produced by the experiences and customs of many generations?",
    "Do ornaments really beautify those who wear them?",
    "Was it the æsthetic sense that prompted the early peoples to pierce their noses and ears; and to extend the lobes of their ears so as to “adorn” themselves with shells, stones, and pieces of metal?",
    "Can we divorce the practice of mutilation from its association with crude religious beliefs?",
    "Inherited ideas of beauty may be wrong ideas, and it can be said of the modern lady who wears collections of brilliant and costly jewels that she is not necessarily made more beautiful by perpetuating a custom rooted in the grossest superstitions of antiquity, for these jewels were originally charms to preserve health, to regulate the flow of blood, to promote fertility and birth, and, generally speaking, to secure “luck” by bringing the wearer into close touch with the “deities”, whose “soul-substance” was contained in them.",
    "When the æsthetic sense of mankind reached that high stage of development represented by Greek sculpture, the so-called ornaments were discarded and the human form depicted in all its natural beauty and charm.",
    "Whatever was holy seemed beautiful to the early people, and that is why in a country like India, with its wealth of exquisitely coloured flowers, the Sanskrit names for gold include Jāta-rūpa (native beauty), and Su-varna (good, or beautiful colour).",
    "The gold colour was really a luck-bringing colour, and therefore beautiful to Aryan eyes.",
    "Having attached in their homelands a fictitious religious value to gold, the early prospectors and miners carried their beliefs and customs with them wherever they went, and these were in time adopted by the peoples with whom they came into contact.",
    "When Columbus crossed the Atlantic he and his followers greatly astonished the unsophisticated natives of the New World by their anxiety to obtain precious metals.",
    "They found, to their joy, that “the sands of the mountain streams glittered with particles of gold; these”, as Washington Irving says,",
    "[267] “the natives would skilfully separate and give to the Spaniards, without expecting a recompense”.",
    "No doubt the early searchers for gold in Africa and Asia met with many peoples who were as much amused and interested, and as helpful, as were the natives of the New World, who welcomed the Spaniards as visitors from the sky.",
    "Gold was the earliest metal worked by man.",
    "It was first used in Egypt to fashion imitation sea-shells, and the magical and religious value attached to the shells was transferred to the gold which, in consequence, became “precious” or “holy”.",
    "Copper was the next metal to be worked.",
    "It was similarly used for the manufacture of personal ornaments and other sacred objects, being regarded apparently, to begin with, as a variety of gold.",
    "But in time—some centuries, it would appear, after copper was first extracted from malachite—some pioneer of a new era began to utilize it as a substitute for flint, and copper knives and other implements were introduced.",
    "This discovery of the usefulness of copper had far-reaching effects, and greatly increased the demand for the magical metal.",
    "Increasing numbers of miners were employed, and search was made for new copper-mines by enterprising prospectors who, in Egypt, were employed, or, at any rate, protected, by the State.",
    "This search had much to do with promoting race movements, and introducing not only new modes of life but new modes of thought into lands situated at great distances from the areas in which these modes of life and thought had origin.",
    "The metal-workers were the missionaries of a New Age.",
    "In this chapter it will be shown how they reached China.",
    "Archæologists are not agreed as to where copper was first used for the manufacture of weapons and implements.",
    "Some favour Egypt, and others Mesopotamia.",
    "In the former country the useful metal was worked in pre-Dynastic times, that is, before 3500 B.C. or 4500 B.C. “Copper ornaments and objects, found in graves earlier than the middle pre-Dynastic period”, wrote the late Mr. Leonard W. King, “are small and of little practical utility as compared with the beautifully flaked flint knives, daggers, and lances....",
    "At a rather later stage in the pre-Dynastic period, copper dagger-blades and adzes were produced in imitation of flint and stone forms, and these mark the transition to the heavy weapons and tools of copper which, in the early Dynastic period, largely ousted flint and stone implements for practical use.",
    "The gradual attainment of skill in the working of copper ore on the part of the early Egyptians had a marked effect on the whole status of their culture.",
    "Their improved weapons enabled them by conquest to draw their raw materials from a far more extended area.”",
    "[268] Copper was found in the wadis of Upper Egypt and on the Red Sea coast—in those very areas in which gold was worked for generations before copper was extracted from malachite.",
    "At a later period the Pharaohs sent gangs of miners to work the copper-mines in the Sinaitic peninsula.",
    "King Semerket, of the early Dynastic age, had men extracting copper in the Wadi Maghara.",
    "“His expedition was exposed to the depredations of the wild tribes of Beduin ... and he recorded his punishment of them in a relief on the rocks of the Wadi.”",
    "There is evidence that at this remote period the Pharaohs “maintained foreign relations with far remote peoples”.",
    "[269] A record of a later age (c. 2000 B.C.) affords us a vivid glimpse of life in the “Mine-Land”.",
    "An official recorded in an inscription that he had been sent there in what he calls the “Evil summer season”.",
    "He complained, “It is not the season for going to this Mine-Land....",
    "The highlands are hot in summer, and the mountains brand the skin.”",
    "Yet he could boast that “he extracted more copper than he had been ordered to obtain”.",
    "[270] The transition from stone to copper cannot be traced in ancient Babylonia.",
    "Sumerian history begins at the seaport Eridu, when that centre of civilization was situated at the head of the Persian Gulf—a fact that suggests the settlement there of seafaring colonists.",
    "At the dawn of Sumerian culture, copper tools and weapons had come into use.",
    "No metals could be found in the alluvial “plain of Shinar”.",
    "The early Babylonians (Sumerians) had to obtain their supplies of copper from Sinai, Armenia, the Caucasus area, and Persia.",
    "It may be that their earliest supplies came from Sinai, and that the battles in that “Mine-Land”, recorded in early Egyptian inscriptions, were fought between rival claimants of the ore from the Nile valley and the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates.",
    "One ancient Pharaoh refers in an inscription to his “first occurrence of smiting the Easterners” in Sinai.",
    "“This designation”, comments Breasted, “of the event as the ‘first occurrence’ would indicate that it was a customary thing for the kings of the time (First Dynasty, c. 3500 B.C.) to chastise the barbarians.”",
    "[271] But were they really “barbarians”?",
    "Is it likely that barbarians would be found in such a region, especially in summer?",
    "It is more probable that the “Easterners” came from an area in which the demand for copper was as great as it was in Egypt.",
    "The regular battles between the ancient “peggers-out” of “claims” in Mine-Land no doubt forced the “Easterners” to search for copper elsewhere.",
    "By following the course of the Tigris the Sumerian prospectors were led to the rich mineral area of the Armenian Highlands, and it is of special significance in this connection to find that the earliest Assyrian colonies were founded by Sumerians.",
    "Apparently Nineveh (Mosul) had origin as a trading centre at which metal ores were collected and sent southward some time before the Semitic Akkadians obtained control of the northern part of the Babylonian plain.",
    "The copper obtained from Armenia and other western Asiatic areas was less suitable than Sinaitic copper, being much softer.",
    "Sinaitic and Egyptian copper is naturally hard on account of the proportion of sulphur it contains.",
    "But after tin was found, and it was discovered that, when mixed with copper, it produced the hard amalgam known as bronze, the Sumerians appear to have entirely deserted the Sinaitic Mine-Land, and left it to the Egyptians.",
    "The Egyptians continued in their Copper Age until their civilization ceased to be controlled by native kings.",
    "Babylonia had likewise a Copper Age to begin with, but copper was at an early period entirely supplanted by bronze, except for religious purposes—a fact which is of great importance, especially when it is found that the religious beliefs associated with copper and gold were disseminated far and wide by the early miners—the troglodytes of Sinai in the early Egyptian texts—who formed colonies that became industrial and trading centres.",
    "Votive images found in Babylonia are of copper.",
    "A good example of early Sumerian religious objects is the interesting bull’s head in copper from Tello, which is dated c. 3000 B.C.",
    "The eyes of this image of the bull-god—the “Bull of Heaven”, the sky-god, whose mother or spouse was the “Cow of Heaven”—“are inlaid with mother-of-pearl and lapis-lazuli”.",
    "A “very similar method is met with in the copper head of a goat which was found at Fara”.",
    "[272] Here we find fused in early Sumerian religious objects complex religious beliefs connected with domesticated animals, sea-shells, and metals.",
    "The opinion, suggested here by the writer, that the battles between rival miners in Sinai compelled the Sumerians to search for copper elsewhere and to discover means whereby the softer copper could be hardened, appears to accord with the view that bronze was first manufactured in Babylonia, or in some area colonized by Babylonia.",
    "In his able summary of the archæological evidence regarding the introduction of bronze, Sir Hercules Read shows that “the attribution of the discovery to Babylonia is preferred as offering fewest difficulties”.",
    "[273] Recent archæological finds make out a good case for Russian Turkestan as the “cradle of the bronze industry”.",
    "In Troy and Crete bronze supplanted flint and obsidian.",
    "There was no Copper Age in either of these culture centres.",
    "The copper artifacts found in Crete are simply small and useless votive axes and other religious objects.",
    "Whence did the Babylonians receive, after the discovery was made how to manufacture bronze, the necessary supplies of tin?",
    "Armenia and the Caucasus “appear”, as Read says, “to be devoid of stanniferous ores”.",
    "Apparently the early metal-searchers had gone as far as Khorassan in Persia before their fellows had ceased to wage battles with Egyptians in the Sinaitic “Mine-Land”.",
    "Tin has been located at Khorassan and “in other parts of Persia, near Asterabad and Tabriz.",
    "[274]... From such areas as these”, Reid says, “the tin used in casting the earliest bronze may have been derived.”",
    "We are now fairly on our way along the highway leading to China.",
    "“In Eastern Asia, beyond the radius of the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia”, Read continues, “there would seem to be no region likely to have witnessed the discovery (of how to work bronze) nearer than Southern China; for India, which has copper implements of a very primitive type, is poor in tin ... while the Malay peninsula, an extremely rich stanniferous region, does not appear to have been mined in very ancient times”.",
    "[275] It is unlikely that bronze was first manufactured in China, considering the period of its introduction into Babylonia, which antedates by several centuries the earliest traces of civilization in the Far East.",
    "The history of the development of the industries and commerce of early Babylonia is the history of the growth and dissemination of civilization, not only in western Asia, but in the “Mid East” and the “Far East”.",
    "Babylonia, the Asiatic granary of the ancient world, lay across the trade routes.",
    "Both its situation and its agricultural resources gave it great commercial importance.",
    "It had abundant supplies of surplus food to stimulate trade, and its industrial activity created a demand for materials that could not be obtained in the rich alluvial plain.",
    "“Over the Persian Gulf”, says Professor Goodspeed, [276] “teak-wood, found in Eridu (the seaside “cradle” of Sumerian culture), was brought from India.",
    "Cotton also made its way from the same source to the southern cities.",
    "Over Arabia, by way of Ur, which stood at the foot of a natural opening from the desert ... were led the caravans laden with stone, spices, copper, and gold [277] from Sinai, Yemen, and Egypt.",
    "Door-sockets of Sinaitic stone found at Nippur attest this traffic.”",
    "Cedar wood was imported from the Syrian mountains “for the adornment of palaces and temples.",
    "From the east, down the pass of Holwan, came the marble and precious metal of the mountains.",
    "Much of this raw material was worked over by Babylonian artisans and shipped back to less-favoured lands, along with the grain, dates, and fish, the rugs and cloths of native production.",
    "All this traffic was in the hands of Babylonian traders, who fearlessly ventured into the borders of distant countries, and must have carried with them thither the knowledge of the civilization and wealth of their own home, for only thus can the widespread influence of Babylonian culture in the earliest periods be explained.”",
    "It was evidently due to the influence of the searchers for metals and the traders that the culture of early Sumeria spread across the Iranian plateau.",
    "As Laufer has shown, [278] “the Iranians were the great mediators between the West and the East”.",
    "The Chinese “were positive utilitarians, and always interested in matters of reality; they have bequeathed to us a great amount of useful information on Iranian plants, products, animals, minerals, customs, and institutions”.",
    "Not only plants but also Western ideas were conveyed to China by the Iranians.",
    "[279] The discoveries of archæological relics made by the De Morgan Expedition in Elam (western Persia), and by the Pumpelly Expedition in Russian Turkestan, have provided further evidence that Sumero-Babylonian civilization exercised great influence over wide areas in ancient times.",
    "Unfortunately no such records as those made by the Egyptians who visited Mine-Land have been discovered either in Babylonia or beside the mineral workings exploited by the Sumerians or Akkadians.",
    "The Egyptian Pharaohs, as we have seen, had to send military forces to protect their miners, and on one occasion found it necessary to conduct mining operations in the hot season instead of in the cool season, a fact which suggests that the opposition shown by rivals was at times very formidable.",
    "It does not follow that the Babylonians had to contend with similar opposition in Armenia and Persia.",
    "They appear to have won the co-operation of the native peoples in the mid-Asian mining districts, and to have made it worth their while to keep up the supply of gold, and copper, and tin.",
    "Babylonia had corn and manufactured articles to sell, and they made it possible for native chiefs to organize their countries and to acquire wealth and a degree of luxury.",
    "Nomadic pastoral peoples became traders, and communities of them adopted Babylonian modes of life.",
    "Mr. W. J. Perry has shown that in districts where minerals were anciently worked, the system of irrigation, which brought wealth and comfort in Babylonia and the Nile valley, was adopted, and that megalithic monuments were erected.",
    "[280] The early searchers for metals and pearls and precious stones were apparently the pioneers of civilization in many a district occupied by backward peoples.",
    "The mineral area to the south-east of the Caspian Sea appears to have been exploited as early as the third millennium B.C., as was also the mineral area stretching from the Caspian to the eastern coast of the Black Sea.",
    "New trade routes were opened up and connections established, not only with Elam and Babylonia in the south, but with Egypt, through Palestine, and with Crete and with the whole Ægean area.",
    "Troy became the “clearing-house” of this early trade flowing from western Asia into Europe.",
    "The enterprising sea-kings of Crete appear to have penetrated the Dardanelles and reached the eastern shores of the Black Sea, where they tapped the overland trade routes.",
    "[281] Dr. Hubert Schmidt, who accompanied the Pumpelly expedition to Russian Turkestan in 1903–4, found Cretan Vasiliki pottery in one of the excavated mounds, and, in another, “three-sided seal-stones of Middle Minoan type (c. 2000 B.C.), engraved with Minoan designs”.",
    "[282] There is evidence which suggests that this trade in metals between western Asia and the Ægean area was in existence long before 2500 B.C., and not long after 3000 B.C. One of the great centres of Mesopotamian culture in the south-eastern Caspian area was Anau, near Askabad, on the Merve-Caspian railway route.",
    "Another was Meshed, which lies to the south-east of Anau in a rich metalliferous mountain region.",
    "One of the “Kurgans” (mounds) excavated at Anau yielded archæological relics that indicated an early connection between Turkestan and Elam in south-western Persia.",
    "In another “Kurgan” were found traces of a copper-culture.",
    "The early searchers for metals were evidently the originators or introducers of this culture, and as the stratum contained baked clay figurines of the Sumerian mother-goddess, the prototype of Ishtar, little doubt can remain whence came the earliest miners.",
    "This region of desolate sand-dunes was in ancient times irrigated by the Mesopotamian colonists who sowed not only the seeds of barley, wheat, and millet, but also the seeds of civilization, and stimulated progress among the native tribes.",
    "The settlers built houses of bricks which had been sun-dried in accordance with the prevailing Babylonian fashion.",
    "The Egyptian potter’s wheel was introduced—another indication that regular trading relations between Babylonia and Egypt were maintained at a very early period.",
    "Mr. Pumpelly, in the first flush of enthusiasm aroused by the mid-Asia revelations, urged the claim that the agricultural mode of life originated in the Transcaspian Oases, and that it passed thence to Babylonia and Egypt.",
    "But the discovery of husks of barley in the stomachs of naturally mummified bodies found in the hot dry sands of Upper Egypt affords proof that cannot be overlooked in this connection.",
    "[283] Agriculture was practised in the Nile valley long centuries before the Transcaspian Copper Age was inaugurated.",
    "Besides, barley and millet grow wild in the Delta area.",
    "The early Mesopotamian searchers for metals, and their pupils from the Transcaspian region, continued the explorations towards the east.",
    "They appear to have wandered to the north-west of the Oxus and the south-east of the Lake Balkash and apparently to the very borders of China.",
    "This eastward drift must have been in progress long before the introduction of bronze into central Europe, which had a Stone Age culture for three or four centuries after bronze implements had become common in Troy and Crete.",
    "The traders who carried bronze into Hungary carried jade too, and the beliefs which had been connected with jade in Asia.",
    "The earliest supplies of European jade objects must have come, as will be shown, from Chinese Turkestan.",
    "There was good reason for the early gold rush towards the east.",
    "Gold can still be easily found “everywhere and in every form” in Siberia.",
    "The Altai means “gold mountains”, and these yield silver and copper as well as gold.",
    "Indeed, eastern Siberia is a much richer metalliferous area than western Siberia, and this fact appears to have been ascertained at a very remote period.",
    "The searchers for metals not only collected gold, copper, and silver on the Altai Mountains and the area of the upper reaches of the Yenesei River, but also penetrated into Chinese Turkestan, where, as in Russian Turkestan, trading colonies were founded, the metals were worked, and the agricultural mode of life, including the system of irrigation, adopted with undoubted success.",
    "[284] Important archæological excavations, conducted by Dr. Stein in Chinese Turkestan, “on behalf of the Indian Government”, have revealed traces of the far-reaching influences exercised by Mesopotamian culture in a region now covered by the vast and confusing sand-dunes of the Taklamakan Desert.",
    "At Khotan the discoveries made were of similar character to those at Anau.",
    "Khotan is the ancient trading centre which connected central Asia and India, and India and China.",
    "One of the most important products of Khotan is jade—that is, important from the historical point of view.",
    "It is uncertain at what period the importation of jade into China from the Khotan area was inaugurated.",
    "But there can be no doubt about the antiquity of the jade trade between Chinese Turkestan and Babylonia.",
    "Some of the Babylonian cylinder-seals were of jade, others being of “marble, jasper, rock-crystal, emerald, amethyst, topaz, chalcedony, onyx, agate, lapis-lazuli, hæmatite, and steatite”",
    "[285]—all relics of ancient trade and mining activity.",
    "Turquoise was imported into Babylonia from Khotan and Kashgar.",
    "The archæological finds made on the site of the ancient Sumerian city at Nippur include cobalt, “presumably from China”.",
    "[286] At Nippur was found, too, Persian marble, lapis-lazuli from Bactria, and cedar and cypress from Zagros.",
    "When it is borne in mind that the chief incentive behind the search for precious metals and precious stones was a religious one, we should not express surprise to find that not only the products of centres of ancient civilization were carried across Asia to outlying parts, but also myths, legends, and religious beliefs of complex character.",
    "These were given a local colouring in different areas.",
    "In northern Siberia, for instance, the local fauna displaced the fauna of the southern religious cults, the reindeer or the goat taking the place of the gazelle or the antelope.",
    "Mythological monsters received new parts, just as the dolphin-god of Cretan and other seafaring peoples received an elephant’s head in northern India and became the makara; and the seafarers’ shark-god received in China the head of a lion, although the lion is not found in China.",
    "No doubt the lion was introduced into China as a religious art motif by some intruding cult.",
    "Touching on this phase of the problem of early cultural contact, Ellis H. Minns",
    "[287] suggests a number of possibilities to account for the similarities between Siberian and Chinese art.",
    "One is that “the resemblance may be due to both (Siberians and Chinese) having borrowed from Iranian or some other Central Asian art....",
    "In each case,” he adds, “we seem to have an intrusion of monsters ultimately derived from Mesopotamia, the great breeding-ground of monsters.”",
    "The data summarized in a previous chapter [288] dealing with the Chinese dragon affords confirmation of this view.",
    "Dr. Joseph Edkins, writing in the seventies of last century as a Christian missionary who made an intensive study of Chinese religious beliefs at first hand, had much to say about the “grafting process” or culture-mixing.",
    "“Every impartial investigator”, he wrote, “will probably admit that the ceremonies and ideas of the Chinese sacrifices link them with Western antiquity.",
    "The inference to be drawn is this, that the Chinese primeval religion was of common origin with the religions of the West.",
    "But if the religion was one, then the political ideas, the mental habits, the sociology, the early arts and knowledge of nature, should have been of common origin also with those of the West.”",
    "[289] No doubt the stories brought from Siberia by the early explorers tended to stimulate the imaginations of the myth-makers of Mesopotamia, India, and China.",
    "The mineral and hot springs in the cold regions may have been regarded as proof that “the wells of life” had real existence.",
    "Some of these wells are so greatly saturated with carbonic acid gas that they burst skin and stone bottles.",
    "“Here is living water indeed!”",
    "the early explorer may have exclaimed when he attempted to carry away a sample.",
    "“The feathers in the air”, as Herodotus puts it when referring to the snow, and the aurora borealis must have greatly impressed the early miners in the mysterious Altai region—a region possessing so much mineral wealth that it must have been regarded as a veritable wonderland of the gods by the early prospectors.",
    "Who knows but that the story of Gilgamesh’s pilgrimage through the dark mountain to the land in which trees bore gems instead of fruit owes something to the narratives of the early explorers who reached mysterious regions rich in metals and gems, where the strange murmurings that fill the air on still winter nights are still referred to as “the whisperings of the stars”, and the aurora borealis, which scatters the darkness and illumines snow-clad mountain ranges and valleys, displays wonderful and vivid colours in great variety.",
    "That the early culture which was disseminated eastward across Siberia to China and westward into Europe was of common origin, is clearly indicated by the archæological remains.",
    "Dealing with the bronzes of Russia and Siberia, Sir Hercules Read writes: “At both extremities of the vast area stretching from Lake Baikal through the Southern Siberian Steppes across the Ural Mountains to the basin of the Volga, and even beyond to the valleys of the Don and Dnieper, there have been found, generally in tombs, but occasionally on the surface of the ground, implements and weapons marked by the same peculiarities of form, and by a single style of decoration.",
    "These objects exhibit an undoubted affinity with those discovered in China; but some of the distinctive features have been traced in the bronze industry of Hungary and the Caucasus; for example, pierced axes and sickles have a close resemblance to Hungarian and Caucasian forms.",
    "The Siberian bronzes have this relationship both in the East and West, but their kinship with Chinese antiquities being the more obvious, it is natural to assume that the culture which they represent is of East Asiatic origin.”",
    "Read notes, however, that “most of the Chinese bronze implements are of developed, and therefore not of primitive forms....",
    "Such forms can only have been reached after a long period of evolution, but their prototypes are found neither in the Ural-Altaic region itself, where some objects may indeed be simpler in design than others, but cannot be described as quite primitive; nor as yet within the limits of China.”",
    "[290] The evidence afforded by ancient religious beliefs and customs tends to show that the cultural centre in Asia, which stimulated the growth of civilization, was Babylonia, while Egyptian influence flowed northward through Palestine and into Syria.",
    "In time the influence of Cretan civilization made itself felt on the eastern shores of the Black Sea.",
    "The ebb and flow of cultural influences along the trade routes at various periods renders the problem of highly complex character.",
    "But one leading fact appears to emerge.",
    "The demand for metals and precious stones in the earliest seats of civilization—that is, in Babylonia and Egypt—stimulated exploration and the spread of a culture based on the agricultural mode of life.",
    "Not only was the system of irrigation, first introduced in the Nilotic and Tigro-Euphratean valleys, adopted by colonies of miners and traders who settled in mid-Asia and founded sub-cultural centres that radiated westward and eastward; the religious ideas and customs that had grown up with the agricultural mode of life in the cradles of ancient civilization were adopted too.",
    "New experiences and new inventions imparted “local colour” to colonial culture, but the leading religious principles that veined that culture underwent little change.",
    "The immemorial quest for the elixir of life was never forgotten.",
    "It was not to purchase their daily bread alone that men lived laborious days washing gold dust from river sands, crushing quartz among the Altai Mountains, or quarrying and fishing jade in Chinese Turkestan; they were chiefly concerned about “purchasing” the “food of life” so as to secure immortality.",
    "The fear of death, which sent Gilgamesh on his long journey, caused many a man in ancient times to wander far and wide in search of life-giving metals, precious stones, pearls, and plants.",
    "And so we find in China as in Egypt, in Babylonia as in western Europe, that the quest of immortality was the chief incentive that stimulated research, discovery, and the spread of civilization.",
    "The demand for the wood of sacred trees, incense-bearing trees and plants, precious metals and precious stones in the temples of Egypt and Babylonia, had much to do with the development of early trade.",
    "The Pharaohs of Egypt and the Patesies of Sumeria fitted out expeditions to obtain treasure for their holy places, and to keep open the trade routes along which the treasure was carried.",
    "That the system of metal-working had anciently an area of origin is emphasized by the investigations conducted by Professor Gowland.",
    "[291] He deals first with the Japanese evidence.",
    "“The method which was practised, and the furnace employed by the early workers, still”, he writes, “survive in use at several mines in Japan at the present time.”",
    "A hole in the ground forms the furnace, and a bellows is used to introduce the blast from the top.",
    "After the copper is smelted it is allowed to cool off, and when it is nearly solidified it is taken out and broken up.",
    "“The copper thus produced in Japan is never cast direct from the smelting furnaces into useful forms, but is always resmelted in crucibles, a mode of procedure which undoubtedly prevailed in Europe during the early Metal and the Bronze Ages.”",
    "The Japanese clay crucibles “are analogous to those found in the pile-dwellings of the Swiss and Upper Austrian lakes”.",
    "Dealing with iron-furnaces, the Professor shows that the Ancient Egyptian furnace resembled “the Japanese furnace for copper, tin, and lead”.",
    "The Etruscan furnace also resembled the Egyptian one.",
    "“From metallurgical considerations only”, Gowland adds, “we would certainly be led to the inference that the Etruscans had obtained their knowledge of the method of extracting metal from that (the Egyptian) source.”",
    "British evidence suggests that the methods obtaining in ancient times were introduced from “the Mediterranean region of Europe....",
    "The actual process for the extraction of iron from its ores in Europe, in fact in all countries in early times, was practically the same.”",
    "Elsewhere, Professor Gowland has written: “It is important to note ... that the type of furnace which survives in India among the hill tribes of the Ghats is closely analogous to the prehistoric furnace of the Danube, and of the Jura district in Europe”.",
    "[292] “Culture-drifts” can thus be followed in their results.",
    "Backward communities that adopted inventions in early times continue to use them in precisely the same manner as did those ancient peoples by whom they were first introduced.",
    "In like manner are early beliefs and customs still perpetuated in isolated areas.",
    "But it does not follow that all these beliefs had origin among the peoples who still cling to them.",
    "Some so-called “primitive” beliefs are really of highly complex character, with as long a history of development as has the primitive type of furnace utilized by the hill tribes of India.",
    "In the next chapter it will be shown that in the jade beliefs of China traces survive of ideas not necessarily of Chinese origin—ideas that, in fact, grew up and passed through processes of development in countries in which jade was never found.",
    "For, as the Chinese bronze implements are “not of primitive forms”, and therefore not indigenous, neither are all Chinese beliefs and customs “primitive” in the same sense, or, in the real sense, indigenous either.",
    "As the stimulus to work metals in China came from an outside source, so, apparently, did the stimulus to search for such a “life-giving” and “luck-conferring” material as jade come from other countries, and from races unrelated to those that occupied China in early times.",
    "The beliefs associated with jade were developed in China, although they did not originate there; and these beliefs were similar to those attached to the pearls, the precious stones, and the precious metals searched for by the ancient prospectors who discovered and first worked jade in Chinese Turkestan and on the borders of China.",
    "To sum up, it would appear that the elements of a religious culture, closely associated with the agricultural mode of life, and common to Sumeria and Egypt, passed across Asia towards China, reaching the Shensi province about 1700 B.C.",
    "At a much later period the complex culture of the Egyptian Empire period gradually drifted along the sea route and left its impress on the Chinese coast.",
    "Iranian culture, which was impregnated with Babylonian and Egyptian ideas, likewise exercised a persisting influence, and was renewed again and again.",
    "One of the ultimate results of the rise of Persia as a world-power, and of the invasion of Asia by Alexander, was to bring China into direct touch with the Hellenistic world.",
    "Indian influence is represented chiefly by Buddhism.",
    "In northern India Buddhism had been blended with Naga (serpent) worship, and when it reached China, the local beliefs regarding dragons were given a Buddhistic colouring.",
    "The Chinese Buddhists mixed the newly-imported religious culture with their own.",
    "The “Islands of the Blest” were retained by the cult of the East, and the Western Paradise by the cult of the West.",
    "The latter paradise is unknown to the Buddhists in Burmah and Ceylon, but has never been forgotten by the Buddhists of northern China.",
    "A Buddha called “Boundless Age” was placed in the garden of the Royal Lady of the West, but that goddess still lingered beside the Peach Tree of Immortality, while the sky-goddess continued to weave the web of the constellations, and the pious men and women of the Taoist faith were supposed to reach her stellar Paradise by sailing along the Celestial River in dragon-boats or riding on the back of dragons.",
    "The Chinese Buddhists found ideas regarding Nirvana less satisfying than those associated with the Paradise of the “Peaceful Land of the West” and the higher Paradise of the “Palaces of the Stars”, in which dwelt the gods and the demi-gods of the older faiths.",
    "Writing in this connection, Dr. Joseph Edkins says: “A mighty branch of foreign origin has been grafted in the old stock.",
    "The metaphysical religion of Shakyamuni was added to the moral doctrines of Confucius.",
    "Another process may then be witnessed.",
    "A native twig was grafted in the Indian branch.",
    "Modern Taoism has grown up on the model supplied by Buddhism.",
    "That it is possible to observe the modus operandi of this repeated grafting, and to estimate the amount of gain and loss to the people of China, resulting from the varied religious teaching which they have thus received, is a circumstance of the greatest interest to the investigator of the world’s religions.”",

    "One’s thoughts at once turn to China when mention is made of jade, for in no other country in the world has it been utilized for such a variety of purposes or connected more closely with the social organization and with religious beliefs and ceremonies.",
    "This tough mineral, which is also called nephrite and “axe-stone”, and is of different chemical composition to jadeite, was known to the Chinese at the very dawn of their history.",
    "It was used by them at first like flint or obsidian for the manufacture of axes, arrow-heads, knives, and chisels, as well as for votive objects and personal ornaments of magical or religious character, and then, as time went on, for mortuary amulets, for images or symbols of deities, for mirrors, [294] for seals and symbols of rank, and even for musical instruments, possessing, as it does, wonderful resonant qualities.",
    "The latter include jade flutes and jade “luck gongs”, which have religious associations.",
    "Native artisans acquired great skill in working this tenacious mineral, and the finest art products in China are those exquisite jade ornaments, symbols, and vessels that survive from various periods of its history.",
    "Not only did the accomplished and patient workers, especially of the Han period (200 B.C.–200 A.D.), achieve a high degree of excellence in carving and engraving jade, and in producing beautiful forms; they also dealt with their hard mineral so as to utilize its various colours and shades, and thus increase the æsthetic qualities of their art products.",
    "The artistic genius, as well as the religious beliefs, of the Chinese has been enshrined in nephrite.",
    "When the prehistoric Chinese settled in Shensi, they found jade in that area.",
    "“All the Chinese questioned by me, experts in antiquarian matters, agree”, Laufer writes, “in stating that the jades of the Chou and Han Dynasties are made of indigenous material once dug on the very soil of Shensi Province, that these quarries have been long ago exhausted, no jade whatever being found there nowadays.",
    "My informant pointed to Lan-tʼien and Fêng-siang-fu as the chief ancient mines.”",
    "[295] But although the early Chinese made use of indigenous jade, it does not follow, as has been noted, that the early beliefs connected with this famous mineral were of indigenous origin.",
    "It cannot be overlooked that the symbolism of jade is similar in character to the older symbolism of pearls, precious stones, and precious metals, and that the associated beliefs can be traced not in China alone, but in such widely-separated countries as India, Babylonia, and Egypt.",
    "There was evidently a psychological motive for the importance attached by the early Chinese to jade, which they called yu.",
    "[296] It had been regarded elsewhere as a precious mineral before they began to search for it and make use of it, especially for religious purposes.",
    "It is not necessary to go back to the “Age of Stone” to theorize regarding Chinese jade beliefs.",
    "It has yet to be established that China had a Neolithic Age.",
    "“As far as the present state of our archæological knowledge and the literary records point out”, says Laufer, “the Chinese have never passed through an epoch which, for other culture regions, has been designated as a Stone Age.”",
    "[297] Stone implements have been found, but, as in ancient Egypt, these were still being manufactured long after metals came into general use.",
    "The fact that the same beliefs were connected with jade as with pearls, shells, gold, &c., is brought out very clearly in Chinese records regarding ancient burial customs.",
    "It was considered to be as necessary in ancient China as in ancient Egypt that the bodies of the dead should be preserved from decay.",
    "The Egyptians mummified their dead, and laid on and beside them a variety of charms that were supposed to afford protection and assist in the process of reanimation; withal, food offerings were provided.",
    "The Chinese, who have long been noted for their tendency to find substitutes for religious offerings, including paper money, believed that the bodies of the dead could be preserved by magic.",
    "At any rate, they did not consider it necessary to practise the science of mummification.",
    "In the Li Ki (chapter 56) the orthodox treatment of the bodies of the Emperor and others is set forth as follows: “The mouth of the Son of Heaven is stuffed with nine cowries, that of a feudal lord with seven, that of a great officer with five, and that of an ordinary official with three”.",
    "[298] Gold and jade were used in like manner.",
    "Laufer quotes from Ko Hung the significant statement: “If there is gold and jade in the nine apertures of the corpse, it will preserve the body from putrefaction”.",
    "A fifth-century Chinese writer says: “When on opening an ancient grave the corpse looks like alive, then there is inside and outside of the body a large quantity of gold and jade.",
    "According to the regulations of the Han Dynasty, princes and lords were buried in clothes adorned with pearls and with boxes of jade for the purpose of preserving the body from decay.”",
    "[299] According to De Groot, pearls were introduced into the mouth of the dead during the Han Dynasty.",
    "“At least”, he says, “it is stated that their mouths were filled with rice, and pearls and jade stone were put therein, in accordance with the established ceremonial usages.”",
    "And Poh hu thung i, a well-known work, professedly written in the first century, says: “On stuffing the mouth of the Son of Heaven with rice, they put jade therein; in the case of a feudal lord they introduce pearls; in that of a great officer and so downwards, as also in that of ordinary officials, cowries are used to this end”.",
    "De Groot, commenting on the evidence, writes: “The same reasons why gold and jade were used for stuffing the mouth of the dead hold good for the use of pearls in this connection”.",
    "He notes that in Chinese literature pearls were regarded as “depositories of Yang matter”, that medical works declare “they can further and facilitate the procreation of children”, and “can be useful for recalling to life those who have expired, or are at the point of dying”.",
    "[300] In India, as a Bengali friend, Mr. Jimut Bahan Sen, M.A., informs me, a native medicine administered to those who are believed to be at the point of death is a mixture of pounded gold and mercury.",
    "It is named Makara-dhwaja.",
    "The makara [301] is in India depicted in a variety of forms.",
    "As a composite lion-legged and fish-tailed “wonder beast” resembling the Chinese dragon, it is the vehicle of the god Varuna, as the Babylonian “sea goat” or “antelope fish” is the vehicle of the god Ea or of the god Marduk (Merodach).",
    "The makara of the northern Buddhists is likewise a combination of land and sea animals or reptiles, including the dolphin with the head of an elephant, goat, ram, lion, dog, or alligator.",
    "[302] In China the lion-headed shark, a form of the sea-god, is likewise a makara or sea-dragon.",
    "Gold and night-shining pearls are connected with the makara as with the dragon.",
    "The Chinese dragon, as we have seen, is born from gold, while curative herbs like the “Red Cloud herb” and the “dragon’s whiskers herb” are emanations of the dragon.",
    "Gold, like the herb, contains “soul substance” in concentrated form.",
    "Pounded gold, the chief ingredient in the makara-dhwaja medicine, is believed in India to renew youth and promote longevity like pounded jade and gold in China.",
    "“In Yung-cheu, which is situated in the Eastern Ocean, rocks exist,” wrote a Chinese sage in the early part of the Christian era.",
    "“From these rocks there issues a brook like sweet wine; it is called the Brook of Jade Must.",
    "If, after drinking some pints out of it, one suddenly feels intoxicated, it will prolong life....",
    "Grease of jade,” we are further told, “is formed inside the mountains which contain jade.",
    "It is always to be found in steep and dangerous spots.",
    "[303] The jade juice, after issuing from those mountains, coagulates into such grease after more than ten thousand years.",
    "This grease is fresh and limpid, like crystal.",
    "If you find it, pulverize it and mix it with the juice of herbs that have no pith; it immediately liquefies; drink one pint of it then and you will live a thousand years....",
    "He who swallows gold will exist as long as gold; he who swallows jade will exist as long as jade.",
    "Those who swallow the real essence of the dark sphere (heavens) will enjoy an everlasting existence; the real essence of the dark sphere is another name for jade.",
    "Bits of jade, when swallowed or taken with water, can in both these cases render man immortal.”",
    "[304] As we have seen, the belief prevailed in China that pearls shone by night.",
    "The mandrake root was believed elsewhere to shine in like manner.",
    "The view is consequently urged by the writer that the myths regarding precious stones, jade, pearls, and herbs of nocturnal luminosity owe their origin to the arbitrary connection of these objects with the moon, and the lunar-goddess or sky-goddess.",
    "In China Ye Kuang (“light of the night”) “is”, Laufer notes, “an ancient term to designate the moon”.",
    "[305] The intimate connection between the Mother deity and precious metals and stones is brought out by Lucian in his De Dea Syria.",
    "He refers to the goddess Hera of Hierapolis, who has “something of the attributes of Athene, and of Aphrodite, and of Selene, and of Rhea, and of Artemis, and of Nemesis, and of the Fates”, and describes her as follows: “In one of her hands she holds a sceptre, and in the other a distaff; [306] on her head she bears rays and a tower, and she has a girdle wherewith they adorn none but Aphrodite of the sky.",
    "And without she is gilt with gold, and gems of great price adorn her, some white, some sea-green, others wine-dark, others flashing like fire.",
    "Besides these there are many onyxes from Sardinia, and the jacinth and emeralds, the offerings of the Egyptians and of the Indians, Ethiopians, Medes, Armenians, and Babylonians.",
    "But the greatest wonder of all I will proceed to tell: she bears a gem on her head, called a Lychnis; it takes its name from its attribute.",
    "From this stone flashes a great light in the night-time, so that the whole temple gleams brightly as by the light of myriads of candles, but in the day-time the brightness grows faint; the gem has the likeness of a bright fire.”",
    "[307] Laufer notes in his The Diamond",
    "[308] that “the name lychnis is connected with the Greek lychnos” (“a portable lamp”), and that, “according to Pliny, the stone is so called from its lustre being heightened by the light of a lamp”.",
    "He thinks the stone in question is the tourmaline.",
    "Laufer reviews a mass of evidence regarding precious stones that were reported to shine by night, and comes to the conclusion that there is no evidence on record “to show that the Chinese ever understood how to render precious stones phosphorescent”.",
    "He adds: “Since this experiment is difficult, there is hardly reason to believe that they should ever have attempted it.",
    "Altogether,” he concludes, “we have to regard the traditions about gems luminous at night, not as a result of scientific effort, but as folk-lore connecting the Orient with the Occident, Chinese society with the Hellenistic world.”",
    "As Laufer shows, the Chinese imported legends regarding magical gems from Fu-lin (“the forest of Fu”), an island in the Mediterranean Sea, which was known to them as “the Western Sea” (Si hai).",
    "[309] At a very much earlier period they imported other legends and beliefs regarding metals and minerals.",
    "Pearls and gold having been connected with the makara or dragon, it is not surprising to find that their lunar attributes were imparted to jade.",
    "Laufer quotes Chinese references to the “moonlight pearl” and the “moon-reflecting gem”, [310] while De Groot deals with Chinese legends about “effulgent pearls”, about “pearls shining during the night”, “flaming or fiery pearls”, and “pearls lighting like the moon”.",
    "De Groot adds, “Similar legends have always been current in the empire (of China) about jade stone”, and he notes in this regard that “at the time of the Emperor Shen-nung (twenty-fifth century B.C.) there existed”, according to Chinese records, “jade which was obtained from agate rocks, under the name of ‘Light shining at night’.",
    "If cast into the waters in the dark it floated on the surface, without its light being extinguished.”",
    "[311] The wishing jewel (“Jewel that grants all desires”) of India, Japan, and China is said to be “the pupil of a fish eye”.",
    "In India it was known in Sanskrit as the cintimani, and was believed to have originated from the makara.",
    "[312] The Chinese records have references to “moonlight pearls” from the eyes of female whales, and from the eyes of dolphins.",
    "[313] It does not follow that this belief about the origin of shining pearls had a connection with observations made of the phosphorescing of parts of marine animals, because the Chinese writers refer too, for instance, to the nocturnal luminosity of rhinoceros horn.",
    "[314] Even coral, which, like jade, was connected with the lunar- or sky-goddess, was supposed to shine by night.",
    "Laufer quotes from the work, Si King tsa (Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital, i.e. Si-ngan-fu), in this connection: “In the pond Tsi-tsʼui there are coral trees twelve feet high.",
    "Each trunk produces three stems, which send forth 426 branches.",
    "These have been presented by Chao Tʼo, King of Nan Yūe (Annam), and were styled ‘beacon-fire trees’.",
    "At night they emitted a brilliant light as though they would go up in flames.”",
    "[315] The “coral tree” here links with the pine, peach, and cassia trees, and the shining mandrake, as well as with jade, gold, precious stones, and pearls.",
    "In Persia the pearl and coral are called margan, which signifies “life-giver” or “life-owner”.",
    "Lapis-lazuli was called Kin tsin (“essence of gold”) during the Tiang period in China.",
    "[316] As the metal associated with the moon was usually silver, gold being chiefly, although not always, the sun metal, we should expect to find silver connected with jade and pearls.",
    "De Groot, who is frankly puzzled over Chinese beliefs regarding pearls, and has to “plead incompetency” to solve the problem why they were “considered as depositories and distributors of vital force”, [317] provides the translation of a passage in the Ta Tsʼing thung li that connects silver with pearls.",
    "It states in reference to burial customs that “in the case of an official of the first, second, or third degree, five small pearls and pieces of jade shall be used for stuffing the mouth; in that of one of the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh rank, five small pieces of gold and of jade.",
    "The gentry shall use three bits of broken gold or silver; among ordinary people the mouth shall be stuffed with three pieces of silver.”",
    "De Groot insists that the principal object of the practice of stuffing the mouths of the dead was “to save the body from a speedy decay”.",
    "[318] It is significant therefore to find references in Chinese literature to “Pearls of Jade”, to “Fire Jade” that sheds light or even “boils a pot”, and to find silver being regarded as a substitute for jade.",
    "Shells, pearls, gold, silver, and jade contained “soul substance” derived from the Great Mother.",
    "As we have seen, Nu Kwa, the mythical Chinese Empress (the sister of Fu Hi, the “Chinese Adam”), who stopped the Deluge, took the place of the ancient goddess in popular legend.",
    "She was credited, as has been indicated, with planning the course of the Celestial River, with creating dragons, with re-erecting one of the four pillars that supported the firmament, and with creating jade for the benefit of mankind.",
    "In Japan Nu Kwa is remembered as Jokwa.",
    "The Japanese beliefs connected with jade are clearly traceable to China.",
    "A Tama may be a piece of jade, a crystal, a tapering pearl, or the pearl carried on the head of a Japanese dragon.",
    "“The Tama”, says Joly, “is associated not only with the Bosatsu and other Buddhist deities or saints, but also with the gods of luck.”",
    "[319] There are a number of heroic legends in which the Tama figures.",
    "In a story, relegated to the eighth century B.C., a famous jade stone is called “the Tama”.",
    "It tells that Pien Ho (the Japanese Benwa) saw an eagle standing on a large block of jade which he took possession of and carried to his king.",
    "The royal magicians thought it valueless, and Benwa’s right foot was cut off.",
    "He made his way to the mountains and replaced the jade, and soon afterwards observed that the same eagle returned and perched upon it again.",
    "When a new king came to the throne Benwa carried the jade to the court, but only to have his left foot cut off.",
    "A third king came to the throne, and on seeing Benwa weeping by the gate of the palace he inquired into the cause of his grief, and had the stone tested, when it was found to be a perfect gem.",
    "This Tama was afterwards regarded so valuable that it was demanded as “a ransom for fifteen cities”.",
    "[320] Here the eagle is associated with the gems containing “soul substance”.",
    "Joly notes that “foxes are also shown holding the Tama”, and he wonders if the globe “held under their talons by the heraldic lions has a similar meaning”.",
    "[321] Foxes and wolves were, like dragons, capable of assuming human form and figure among the were-animals of the Far East.",
    "As these were-animals include the tiger, which is a god in China, it is possible that they were ancient deities.",
    "The lion is associated with the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, with the Cretan mother-goddess, while the Egyptian Tefnut has a lioness form.",
    "Tammuz of Babylon is, as Nin-girsu of Lagash, a lion-headed eagle.",
    "The Indian Vishnu has a lion-headed avatar.",
    "The connection of the precious jewel and of gold with the supreme deity is traceable to the ancient beliefs regarding the shark-guardian of pearls.",
    "As the beliefs associated with pearls were transferred to jade, it need not surprise us to find the sacred fish—a form of the Great Mother—connected with jade.",
    "A significant text is quoted by Laufer, without comment, which brings out this connection.",
    "He says that “Lü Pu-wei, who died in B.C. 235, reports in his book Lu-shih Chʼun Tsʼiu: ‘Pearls are placed in the mouth of the dead, and fish-scales are added; these are now utilized for interment with the dead.’",
    "The Commentary to this passage explains: ‘To place pearls in the mouth of the dead (han chu) means to fill the mouth with them; the addition of fish-scales means, to enclose these in a jade casket which is placed on the body of the deceased, as if it should be covered with fish-scales.’”",
    "[322] Jade fish-symbols figure among the Chinese mortuary amulets.",
    "Light is thrown on Chinese beliefs regarding resurrection by the cicada mortuary amulet which was made of jade.",
    "It was placed on the tongue of the dead and seems therefore to have been like the Egyptian scarab amulet, a guarantee of immortality.",
    "One of the important ceremonies in connection with the process of reanimating an Egyptian corpse was “the opening of the mouth”.",
    "It was necessary that the reanimated corpse should speak with “the true voice” and justify itself in the court of Osiris, judge of the dead, when the heart was weighed in the balance.",
    "Tongue and heart were closely connected.",
    "According to the beliefs associated with the cult of Ptah, which was fused with the cult of Osiris, the heart was “the mind”, and the source of all power and all life.",
    "The tongue expressed the thoughts of the mind.",
    "Ptah, the great, is the mind and tongue of the gods.",
    "Ptah, from whom proceeded the power Of the mind, And of the tongue....",
    "It (the mind) is the one that bringeth forth every successful issue.",
    "It is the tongue that repeats the thoughts of the mind.",
    "[323] The mind was the essence of life: the tongue, which formed the word, was the active agent of the mind (heart).",
    "As “the stuffing of the corpse with jade took the place of embalming”",
    "[324] in China, the custom of placing a jade amulet on the tongue is of marked significance.",
    "It is quite evidently an imported custom.",
    "The cicada takes the place of the Egyptian scarabæus, the beetle-god of Egypt, named Khepera and called in the texts “father of the gods”.",
    "In ancient Egypt scarabs were placed on the bodies and in the tombs of the dead to protect heart (mind) and tongue and ensure resurrection.",
    "A text sets forth in this connection: “And behold, thou shalt make a scarab of green stone, with a rim of gold, and this shall be placed in the heart of a man, and it shall perform for him the ‘Opening of the Mouth’”.",
    "The scarab is to be anointed with “ānti unguent” and then “words of power” are to be recited over it.",
    "In “words of power” the deceased addresses the scarab as “my heart, my mother: my heart whereby I came into being”.",
    "The beetle-god, in whose form the scarab was made, “becomes”, as Budge says, “in a manner a type of the dead body, that is to say, he represents matter containing a living germ which is about to pass from a state of inertness into one of active life.",
    "As he was a living germ in the abyss of Nu (the primeval deep) and made himself emerge therefrom in the form of the rising sun, so the germ of the living soul, which existed in the dead body of man, and was to burst into new life in a new world by means of the prayers recited during the performance of appropriate ceremonies, emerged from its old body in a new form either in the realm of Osiris or in the boat of Ra (the sun-god).”",
    "[325] This Egyptian doctrine was symbolized by the beetle which rolls a bit of dung in the dust into the form of a ball, and then, having dug a hole in the ground, pushes it in and buries it.",
    "Thereafter the beetle enters the subterranean chamber to devour the ball.",
    "This beetle also collects dung to feed the larvæ which ultimately emerge from the ground in beetle form.",
    "As the Chinese substituted jade for pearls, so did they substitute the cicada for the dung-beetle.",
    "The cicada belongs to that class of insect which feeds on the juices of plants.",
    "It is large and broad with brightly-coloured wings.",
    "The male has on each side of the body a sort of drum which enables it to make that chirping noise called “the song of the cicada”, referred to by the ancient classical poets.",
    "When the female lays her eggs she bores a hole in a tree and deposits them in it.",
    "Wingless larvæ are hatched, and they bore their way into the ground to feed on the juices of roots.",
    "After a time—in some cases after the lapse of several years—the cicada emerges from the ground, the skin breaks open, and the winged insect rises in the air.",
    "The most remarkable species of the cicada is found in the United States, where it passes through a life-history of seventeen years, the greater part of that time being spent underground—the larval stage.",
    "In China the newly-hatched larva sometimes bores down into the earth to a depth of about twenty feet.",
    "“The observation of this wonderful process of nature,” says Laufer, “seems to be the basic idea of this (cicada) amulet.",
    "The dead will awaken to a new life from his grave as the chirping cicada rises from the pupa buried in the ground.",
    "This amulet, accordingly, was an emblem of resurrection.”",
    "Laufer quotes in this connection from the Chinese philosopher Wang Chʼung, who wrote: “Prior to casting off the exuviæ, a cicada is a chrysalis.",
    "When it casts them off, it leaves the pupa state, and is transformed into a cicada.",
    "The vital spirit of a dead man leaving the body may be compared to the cicada emerging from the chrysalis.”",
    "[326] The fact that the cicada feeds on the juices of plants apparently connected it with the idea of the Tree of Life, the source of “soul substance”.",
    "Another insect symbol of resurrection was the butterfly, which was connected with the Plum Tree of Life.",
    "Laufer notes that some butterflies carved from jade, which were used as mortuary amulets, have a plum-blossom pattern between the antennæ and plum-blossoms “carved à jour in the wings”.",
    "[327] He notes that “in modern times the combination of butterfly and plum-blossom is used to express a rebus with the meaning ‘Always great age’”.",
    "This amulet is of great antiquity.",
    "The butterfly symbol of resurrection is found in Mexico.",
    "The Codex Remensis shows an anthropomorphic butterfly from whose mouth a human face emerges.",
    "Freyja, the Scandinavian goddess, is connected with the butterfly, and in Greece and Italy the same insect was associated with the idea of resurrection.",
    "Psyche (a name signifying “soul”) has butterfly wings.",
    "Apparently the butterfly, like the cicada, was supposed to derive its vitality from the mother-goddess’s Tree of Life.",
    "Another important Chinese mortuary jade object was the frog or toad amulet.",
    "As we have seen, the frog was connected with the moon and the lunar goddess, and in China, as in ancient Egypt, was a symbol of resurrection.",
    "Among the interesting jade amulets shown by Laufer are two that roughly resemble in shape the Egyptian scarabs.",
    "“The two pieces”, he writes, “show traces of gilding, and resemble helmets in their shape, and are moulded into the figures of a curious monster which it is difficult to name.",
    "It seems to me that it is possibly some fabulous giant bird, for on the sides, two wings, each marked by five pinions, are brought out, a long, curved neck rises from below, though the two triangular ears do not fit the conception of a bird.”",
    "[328] The figure apparently represents a “composite wonder beast”.",
    "Fishes and composite quadrapeds were also depicted in jade and placed in graves.",
    "Human figures are rare.",
    "Stone coffins were used in ancient times.",
    "The books of the later Han Dynasty (at the beginning of our era) tell about a pious governor, Wang Khiao, who receives a jade coffin from heaven.",
    "It was placed by unseen hands in his hall.",
    "His servants endeavoured to take it away, but found it could not be moved.",
    "De Groot, [329] who translates the story, continues: “Khiao said, ‘Can this mean that the Emperor of Heaven calls me towards him?’",
    "He bathed himself, put on his official attire with its ornaments, and lay down in the coffin, the lid being immediately closed over him.",
    "When the night had passed, they buried him on the east side of the city, and the earth heaped itself over him in the shape a tumulus.",
    "All the cows in the district on that evening were wet with perspiration and got out of breath, and nobody knew whence this came.",
    "The people thereupon erected a temple for him.”",
    "De Groot quotes from another work written in the fifth century, which relates that “at Lin-siang there is in the water a couch of stone, upon which stand two coffins of solid stone, green like copper mirrors.",
    "There is nobody who can give information regarding them.”",
    "[330] Here we have jade used for the preservation of the dead, associated with the sky, with cows, water, and stone, and, in addition, a reference to green copper.",
    "Jade has taken the place of pearls, and pearls were, as has been shown, connected with the mother-goddess, the sky and cow deity who was the source of fertilizing and creative moisture and “soul substance”.",
    "The standing stones of the mother-goddess were supposed to perspire, and to split and give birth to dragons or gods.",
    "This idea appears to lie behind the story regarding the perspiring cows.",
    "An influence was at work on the night when the sage was buried in the jade coffin, and that influence came from the sky, and was concentrated in jade.",
    "It is necessary, therefore, at this point, to get at Chinese ideas regarding the connection between jade and the mysterious influence or influences in what we call “Nature”.",
    "Behind all mythologies lie basic ideas regarding the universe.",
    "To understand a local or localized mythology, it is necessary that we should know something regarding the world in which lived those who invented or perpetuated the myths.",
    "The Chinese world was flat, and over it was the dome of the firmament supported by four pillars.",
    "These pillars were situated at the four cardinal points, and were each guarded by a sentinel deity.",
    "The deities exercised an influence on the world and on all living beings in it, and their influence was particularly strong during their seasons.",
    "Like the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians the Chinese believed that their world was surrounded by water.",
    "There are references in the texts to the “Four Seas”, and to what the Egyptians called the “Great Circle” (Okeanos).",
    "The Babylonians believed the world was a mountain, and their temples were models of their world.",
    "Thus the temple of Enlil, as the world-god, was called E-Kur, which signifies “mountain house”.",
    "His consort Ninlil was also called Nin-Kharsag, “the lady of the mountain”.",
    "[331] The Babylonian and Egyptian temples were not only places of worship, but seats of learning, and they had workshops in which the dyers, metal-workers, &c., plied their sacred trades.",
    "Chinese palaces and universities were in ancient times models of the world.",
    "One of the odes says of King Wu: “In the capital of Hao he built his hall with its circlet of water.",
    "From the west to the east, from the south to the north, there was not a thought but did him homage.”",
    "[332] This hall was a royal college, “built”, says Legge, “in the middle of a circle of water”.",
    "Colleges might also have semicircular pools in front of them, “as may now be seen in front of the temples of Confucius in the metropolitan cities of the provinces”.",
    "[333] Ceremonies were studied in these institutions.",
    "There were also grave-pools.",
    "In Singapore these grave-pools have had to be abolished because they were utilized for hatching purposes by mosquitoes.",
    "Much attention was paid by the Chinese to the shape and situation of a temple, college, palace, or grave.",
    "Each was subjected to good and bad influences, and as seafarers set their sails to take full advantage of a favourable breeze, so did the Chinese construct edifices and graves to take full advantage of favourable influences emanating from what may be called the “magic tanks” of the universe—the cardinal points and the sky.",
    "The beliefs involved in this custom are not peculiar to China.",
    "In Scottish Gaelic, for instance, there is the old saying: Shut the north window, And quickly close the window to the south; And shut the window facing west; Evil never came from the east.",
    "Another saying is: “Shut the windows to the north, open the windows to the south, and do not let the fire go out”.",
    "Both in Scottish and Irish Gaelic the north is the “airt” (cardinal point) of evil influence, and is coloured black, as is the north in China, and the south in India.",
    "The black Indian south is “Yama’s gate”, that is the “gate” of the god of death.",
    "One cannot say anything worse to a Hindu than “Go to Yama’s gate”.",
    "The north is the good and white “airt” of Indian mythology; the good go northward to Paradise, as in Scotland they go southward.",
    "A Japanese poet has written: “The Paradise is in the south; only fools pray towards the west”.",
    "[334] In the Pyramid Texts of ancient Egypt the east is held by the solar cult “to be the most sacred of all regions”, while the west is the sacred “airt” of the Osirian cult.",
    "[335] In the east the sun-god, to whom the soul of the dead Pharaoh went, was supposed to be reborn every morning.",
    "The Chinese regarded the east “as the quarter”, says De Groot, “in which is rooted the life of everything, the great genitor of life (the sun) being born there every day”.",
    "[336] As we have seen, there was in China, as in Egypt, a rival cult of the west.",
    "The gods of the four quarters of China, from whom influences flowed, were: The Blue (or Green) Dragon (east), the Red Bird (south), the White Tiger (west), and the Black Tortoise (north).",
    "The east is the left side, and the west is the right side; a worshipper therefore faces the south.",
    "In Irish and Scottish Gaelic lore the south is the right side, and the north is the left side; a worshipper therefore faces the east.",
    "According to Kwang-tze, the Taoist, it was believed in China that “the breath (or influence) of the east is wind, and wind creates wood”; that “the breath of the south is Yang, which creates fire”; that “the centre is earth”; that “the breath of the west is Yin, which gives birth to metal”; and that the breath of the north “is cold, by which water is produced”.",
    "Another native pre-Christian writer says that “the east appertains to wood, the south to fire, the west to metal, and the north to water”.",
    "[337] Thus taking in the seasons we have the following combinations, showing the organs of the body influenced by the gods of the “airts”: East—the Blue Dragon, Spring, Wood; Planet, Jupiter; liver and gall.",
    "South—the Red Bird, Summer, Fire, the Sun; Planet, Mars; heart and large intestines.",
    "West—the White Tiger, Autumn, Wind, Metal; Planet, Venus; lungs and small intestine.",
    "North—the Black Tortoise, Winter, Cold, Water; Planet, Mercury; kidneys and bladder.",
    "The good influence (or breath) was summed up in the term Yang, and bad influence in the term Yin.",
    "Yang refers to what is bright, warm, active, and life-giving; and Yin to what is inactive, cold, and of the earth earthy.",
    "“When”, says a Chinese writer, “we speak of the Yin and the Yang, we mean the air (or ether) collected in the Great Void.",
    "When we speak of the Hard and Soft, we mean that ether collected and formed into substance.”",
    "[338] Says De Groot in this connection: “In China vital power is specially assimilated with the Yang, the chief part of the Cosmos, identified with light, warmth, and life”.",
    "Yin is “the principle of darkness, cold, and death, standing in the universe diametrically opposite to Yang”.",
    "[339] The chief source of Yang is the sun, which gives forth “shen” or “soul substance”; the chief source of Yin is the moon.",
    "Yang strengthens the vital energy, and is the active principle in various elixirs of life, including, as De Groot notes, “the cock, jade, gold, pearls, and the products of pine and cypress trees”.",
    "[340] Yin and Yang are controlled by the constellation, the Great Bear, called in China “the Bushel”.",
    "In the Shi Ki there is a reference to “the seven stars of the Bushel”, styled “the Revolving Pearls or the Balance of Jasper”, and arrayed “to form the body of seven rulers”.",
    "This constellation is “the chariot of the Emperor (of Heaven).",
    "Revolving around the pole, it descends to rule the four quarters of the sphere and to separate the Yin and the Yang; by so doing it fixes the four seasons, upholds the equilibrium between the five elements, moves forward the subdivisions of the sphere, and establishes all order in the Universe.”",
    "[341] An ancient Chinese writer says in this connection that when the handle (tail) of the Bushel (Great Bear) points to the east (at nightfall), it is spring to all the world.",
    "When the handle points to the south it is summer, when it points to the west it is autumn, and when it points to the north it is winter.",
    "In the Shu King (Part II, Book I) the Great Bear is referred to as “the pearl-adorned turning sphere with its transverse tube of jade”.",
    "[342] The Polar Star is the “Pivot of the Sky”, which revolves in its place, “carrying round with it all the other heavenly bodies”.",
    "In like manner the Taoists taught that “the body of man is carried round his spirit and by it”.",
    "The spirit is thus the “Pivot of Jade”.",
    "That is why the Pivot of Jade is used in the ritual services of Taoism.",
    "[343] In Norse-Icelandic mythology the World Mill controls the seasons and the movements of the heavenly bodies.",
    "The heavens revolve round the Polar Star, Veraldar Nagli (“the world spike”).",
    "Nine giant maids turn the world mill.",
    "[344] The Babylonians, who were the pioneer astronomers and astrologers of Asia, identified the stable and controlling spirit of the night sky with the Polar Star, which was called “Ilu Sar” (“the god Shar”) or “Anshar” (“Star of the Height” or “Star of the Most High”).",
    "[345] Isaiah (xiv, 4–14) refers to the supreme star-god when he makes Lucifer declare: “I will ascend unto heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be the most High”.",
    "Chinese astronomy and the Chinese calendar are undoubtedly of Babylonian origin.",
    "The Babylonian god of the Pole Star has not been forgotten.",
    "Dr. Edkins once asked a Chinese schoolmaster: “Who is the Lord of heaven and earth?”",
    "He replied “that he knew none but the Pole Star,” called in the Chinese language Teen-hwang-ta-te, the great imperial ruler of heaven.",
    "[346] There is a god and a goddess in the Great Bear.",
    "“Among the liturgical works used by the priests of Tao”, says Edkins, “one of the commonest consists of prayers to Towmoo, a female divinity supposed to reside in the Great Bear.",
    "A part of the same constellation is worshipped under the name Kwei-sing.",
    "A small temple is erected to this deity on the east side of the entrance to Confucian temples, and he is regarded as being favourable to literature.”",
    "But the chief god of literature is “Wen-chang”, who is identified with a constellation near the Great Bear which bears his name.",
    "He is prayed to by scholars to assist them in their examinations.",
    "Temples were erected to him on elevated earthen terraces.",
    "“Wen-chang”, says Edkins, “is said to have come down to our world during many generations at irregular intervals.",
    "Virtuous and highly-gifted men were chosen from history as likely to have been incarnations of this divinity.”",
    "[347] The five elements controlled by the Great Bear as it swings round the Polar Star are in China (1) water, (2) fire, (3) wood, (4) metal, and (5) earth.",
    "These elements compose what we call Nature.",
    "As we have seen, they were placed under the guardianship of animal gods.",
    "The White Tiger of the West, for instance, is associated with metal.",
    "When, therefore, metal is placed in a grave, a ceremonial connection with the tiger-god is effected.",
    "“According to the Annals of Wu and Yueh, three days after the burial of the king, the essence of the element metal assumed the shape of a white tiger and crouched down on the top of the grave.”",
    "[348] Here the tiger is a protector—a preserver.",
    "Jade being strongly imbued with Yang or “soul substance” was intimately associated with all the gods, and the various colours of jade were connected with the colours of the “airts” and of the heavens and earth.",
    "Laufer quotes from the eighteenth chapter of Chou li, which deals with the functions of the Master of Religious Ceremonies: “He makes of jade the six objects to do homage to Heaven, to Earth, and to the Four Points of the compass.",
    "With the round tablet pi of bluish (or greenish) colour, he does homage to Heaven.",
    "With the yellow jade tube tsʼung, he does homage to Earth.",
    "With the green [349] tablet Kuei, he renders homage to the region of the East.",
    "With the red tablet chang, he renders homage to the region of the South.",
    "With the white tablet in the shape of a tiger (hu), he renders homage to the region of the West.",
    "With the black jade piece of semicircular shape (huang) he renders homage to the region of the North.",
    "The colour of the victims and of the pieces of silk for these various spirits correspond to that of the jade tablet.”",
    "[350] The shape, as well as the colours, of the jade symbols was of ritualistic importance.",
    "What would appear to be the most ancient Chinese doctrine regarding the influences or “breaths” that emanated from Nature, and affected the living and the dead, is summed up in the term Fung-shui.",
    "“Fung” means wind, and “shui” means “the water from the clouds which the wind distributes over the world”.",
    "Certain winds are good, and certain winds are bad.",
    "The importance attached to wind and water appears to be connected with the ancient belief, found in Babylonia and Egypt, that wind is the “breath of life”, the soul, and that water is the source of all life—“the water of life”.",
    "“Fung-shui”, says De Groot, “denotes the atmospherical influences which bear absolute sway over the fate of man, as none of the principal elements of life can be produced without favourable weather and rains.”",
    "It also means, he adds, “a quasi-scientific system, supposed to teach men where and how to build graves, temples, and dwellings, in order that the dead, the gods, and the living may be located therein exclusively, or as far as possible, under the auspicious influences of Nature”.",
    "[351] The controllers of wind and water are the White Tiger god of the West, and the Blue (or green) Dragon god of the East.",
    "“These animals”, says De Groot, “represent all that is expressed by the word Fung-shui, viz., both æolian and aquatic influences, Confucius being reputed to have said that ‘the winds follow the tiger’, and the dragon having, since time immemorial, in Chinese cosmological mythology played the part of chief spirit of water and rain.”",
    "[352] When the dead were buried it was considered necessary, according to Fung-shui principles, to have graves facing the south, and the Dragon symbol on the left (east) side of the coffin, and the Tiger symbol on the right (west) side, while the Red Bird of the south was on the front, and the Black Tortoise of the north on the back.",
    "These symbols were, so to speak, set amidst natural surroundings that allowed the “free flow” of auspicious influences or “breaths”.",
    "A site for a burial-ground was carefully selected, due account being taken of the configurations of the surrounding country and the courses followed by streams.",
    "[353] Not only graves, but houses and towns, were so placed as to secure the requisite balance between the forces of Nature.",
    "De Groot notes that Amoy is reputed by Chinese believers of the Fung-shui system to owe its prosperity to two knolls flanking the inner harbour, called “Tiger-head Hill” and “Dragon-head Hill”.",
    "Canton is influenced by the “White clouds”, a chain of hills representing the Dragon on one side of its river, and by undulating ground opposite representing the Tiger.",
    "“Similarly”, he says, “Peking is protected on the north-west by the Kin-shan or Golden Hills, which represent the Tiger and ensure its prosperity, together with that of the whole empire and the reigning dynasty.",
    "These hills contain the sources of a felicitous watercourse, called Yu-ho or ‘Jade River’, which enters Peking on the north-west, and flows through the grounds at the back of the Imperial Palace, then accumulates its beneficial influences in three large reservoirs or lakes dug on the west side, and finally flows past the entire front of the inner palace, where it bears the name of the Golden Water.”",
    "[354] Here we find jade and gold closely associated in the Fung-shui system.",
    "As we have seen, white jade was used when the Tiger god of the West was worshipped; it is known as “tiger jade”; a tiger was depicted on the jade symbol.",
    "To the Chinese the tiger was the king of all animals and “lord of the mountains”, and the tiger-jade ornament was specially reserved for commanders of armies.",
    "The male tiger was, among other things, the god of war, and in this capacity it not only assisted the armies of the emperors, but fought the demons that threatened the dead in their graves.",
    "There are traces in China of a tigress shape of the goddess of the West.",
    "Laufer refers to an ancient legend of the country of Chu, which tells of a prince who in the eighth century B.C. married a princess of Yün.",
    "A son was born to them and named Tou Po-pi.",
    "The father died and the widow returned to Yün, where Tou Po-pi, in his youth, had an intrigue with a princess who bore him a son.",
    "“The grandmother ordered the infant to be carried away and deserted on a marsh, but a tigress came to suckle the child.",
    "One day when the prince of Yün was out hunting, he discovered this circumstance, and when he returned home terror-stricken, his wife unveiled to him the affair.",
    "Touched by this marvellous incident, they sent messengers after the child, and had it cared for.",
    "The people of Chʼu, who spoke a language differing from Chinese, called suckling nou, and a tiger they called yü-tʼu; hence the boy was named Nou Yü-tʼu (‘Suckled by a Tigress’).",
    "He subsequently became minister of Chʼu.”",
    "[355] This Far Eastern legend recalls that of Romulus and Remus, who were thrown into the Tiber but were preserved and rescued; they were afterwards suckled by a she-wolf.",
    "The Cretan Zeus was suckled, according to one legend, by a sow, and to another by a goat.",
    "A Knossian seal depicts a child suckled by a horned sheep.",
    "Sir Arthur Evans refers, in this connection, to the legends of the grandson of Minos who was suckled by a bitch; of Miletos, “the mythical founder of the city of that name”, being nursed by wolves.",
    "[356] Vultures guarded the Indian heroine Shakuntala, the Assyrian Semiramis was protected by doves, while the Babylonian Gilgamesh and the Persian patriarch Akhamanish were protected and rescued at birth by eagles.",
    "Horus of Egypt was nourished and concealed by the serpent goddess Uazit, and in his boyhood made friends of wild animals, as did also Bharata, the son of the Indian vulture-guarded Shakuntala.",
    "Horus figures in the constellation of Argo as a child floating in a chest or boat like the abandoned Moses, the abandoned Indian Karna, the abandoned Sargon of Akkad, and, as it would appear, Tammuz who in childhood lay in a “sunken boat”.",
    "Horus of the older Egyptian legends was concealed on a green floating island on the Nile—the “green bed of Horus”.",
    "[357] The oldest known form of the suckling legend is found in the Pyramid Texts of Ancient Egypt.",
    "When the soul of the Pharaoh went to the Otherworld he was suckled by a goddess or by the goddesses of the north and south.",
    "The latter are referred to in the Texts as “the two vultures with long hair and hanging breasts”.",
    "[358] Here the vultures take the place of the cow-goddess Hathor.",
    "In Troy the cow-mother, covered with stars, becomes the star-adorned sow-mother.",
    "[359] Demeter had a sow form and Athene a goat form, and other goddesses had dove, eagle, wolf, bitch, &c., forms.",
    "The Chinese tigress-goddess is evidently a Far Eastern animal form of the Great Mother who suckles the souls of the dead and the abandoned children who are destined to become notables.",
    "Thus behind the wind-god, in the Chinese Fung-shui system, we meet with complex ideas regarding the source of the “air of life”, and the source of the food-supply.",
    "The Blue Dragon of the East is the Naga form of the Aryo-Indian Indra, [360] the rain-controller, the fertilizer, who is closely associated with Vayu, the wind-god; the dragon is the thunderer, too, like Indra.",
    "The close association of the tiger- and dragon-gods in the Fung-shui system may account for the custom of decorating jade symbols of the tiger with the thunder pattern.",
    "[361] In jade-lore, as will be seen, we touch on complex religious beliefs and conceptions not entirely of Chinese origin.",
    "Indeed, it is necessary to leave China and investigate the religious systems of more ancient countries to understand rightly Chinese ideas regarding jade as a substitute for gold, pearls, precious stones, &c., and its connection with vegetation and the Great Mother, the source of all life.",
    "It remains with us to deal with Chinese ideas regarding the soul which was protected by jade, the concentrated form of “soul substance”.",
    "The Chinese believed that a human being had two souls.",
    "One was the Kwei, that is the soul which partook of the nature of the element Yin and returned to the earth from which it originally came; [362] the other soul was the shen which partook of the element Yang.",
    "When the shen is in the living body, it is called Khi or “breath”; after death “it lives forth as a refulgent spirit, styled ming”.",
    "The other soul, called Kwei, is known as the pʼoh during life; after death it lives on in the grave beside the body, which is supposed to be protected against decay by the jade, gold, pearls, shells, &c., and the good influences “flowing” from east and west.",
    "The shen, like the cicada, may also dwell for a time in the grave or in the gravestone before it rises on wings to the Sky Paradise, or passes to the Western Paradise or the Eastern “Islands of the Blest”.",
    "Ancient local and tribal beliefs and beliefs imported at different periods from different culture centres were evidently fused in China, and we consequently meet with a variety of ideas regarding the destiny of the shen.",
    "“Departed souls”, says De Groot, “are sometimes popularly represented as repairing to the regions of bliss on the back of a crane.”",
    "[363] The soul may sail to the Western Paradise in a boat.",
    "“Thou hast departed to the West, from whence there is no returning in the barge of mercy”, runs an address to the corpse.[363]",
    "Here we have the Ra-boat of Egypt conveying the soul to the Osirian Paradise.",
    "As has been shown, souls sometimes departed on the backs of dragons, or rose in the air towards cloudland, there to sail in boats or ride on the backs of birds or kirins, or reached the moon or star-land by climbing a gigantic tree.",
    "Belief in transmigration of souls can also be traced in China, the result apparently of the importation of pre-Buddhist as well as Buddhist beliefs from India.",
    "The living performed ceremonies to assist the soul of the dead on its last journey.",
    "Priests chanted: I salute Ye, Celestial Judges of the three spheres constituting the higher, middle, and lower divisions of the Universe, and Ye, host of Kings and nobles of the departments of land and water and of the world of men!",
    "Remember the soul of the dead, and help it forward in going to the Paradise of the West.",
    "[364] Egyptian, Babylonian, and Indian ideas regarding the Western Paradise are here significantly mingled.",
    "During life the soul might leave the body for a period, either during sleep or when one fainted suddenly.",
    "This belief is widespread.",
    "The soul, in folk-stories, is sometimes seen, as in Scotland, as a bee, or bird, or serpent, as in Norway as an insect or mouse, as in Indonesia and elsewhere as a worm, snake, butterfly, or mouse, and even, as in different countries, as deer, cats, pigs, crocodiles, &c. Chinese beliefs regarding souls as butterflies, cicadas, &c., have already been referred to.",
    "The wandering soul could be “called back” by repeating the individual’s name.",
    "In China, even the dead were called back, and the ceremony of recalling the soul is prominent in funeral rites, as De Groot shows.",
    "[365] Peoples as far separated as the Mongolian Buriats and the inhabitants of England, Scotland, and Ireland believed that ghosts could be enticed to return to the body.",
    "[366] The “death-howl” in China and Egypt, and elsewhere, is evidently connected with this ancient belief.",
    "Of special interest is the evidence regarding Korean customs and beliefs.",
    "Mrs. Bishop writes: “Man is supposed to have three souls.",
    "After death one occupies the tablet, one the grave, and one the unknown.",
    "During the passing of the spirit there is complete silence.",
    "The under-garments of the dead are taken out by a servant, who waves them in the air, and calls him by name, the relations and friends meantime wailing loudly.",
    "After a time the clothes are thrown upon the roof.”",
    "When a man dies, one of his souls is supposed to be seized and carried to the unknown and placed on trial before the Ten Judges, who sentence it “either to ‘a good place’ or to one of the manifold hells”.",
    "[367] Professor Elliot Smith, reviewing the Chinese ideas regarding the two souls, comes to the conclusion that “the early Chinese conceptions of the soul and its functions are essentially identical with the Egyptian, and must have been derived from the same source”.",
    "[368] As the Chinese have the shen and the Kwei, so had the Egyptians the Ka and the ba.",
    "The Ka was the spirit of the placenta, “which was accredited with the attributes of the life-giving and birth-promoting Great Mother and intimately related to the moon and the earliest totem”.",
    "[369] In China the beliefs and customs connected with the placenta and the moon are quite Egyptian in character.",
    "[370] Even in the worship of ancestors in China one can trace the influence of Ancient Egyptian ideas.",
    "When the Pharaoh died, he was identified with the god.",
    "King Unis, in the Pyramid Texts, becomes Osiris, who controls the Nile.",
    "“It is Unis”, we read, “who inundates the land.”",
    "Pepi I, in like manner, supplanted the god, and he is addressed as Osiris, as is also King Mernere—“Ho this Osiris, King Mernere!”",
    "runs a Pyramid Text.",
    "[371] The sun-god Ra was similarly supplanted by his son, the dead Pharaoh.",
    "The souls of Chinese ancestors, who passed to the Otherworld, became identified with the deities who protected households.",
    "Emperors became, after death, emperors in heaven and their souls were the deified preservers of their dynasties.",
    "Clan and tribal ancestors were protectors of their clans and tribes, and families were ever under the care of the souls of their founders.",
    "The belief became deeply rooted in China that the ancestral soul exercised from generation to generation a beneficent influence over a home.",
    "It is not surprising to find, therefore, that gods are exceedingly numerous in China, and that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish an ancestor from a god and a god from an ancestor.",
    "The State religion was something apart from domestic religion.",
    "Emperors worshipped the deities that controlled the nation’s destinies, and families worshipped the deities of the household.",
    "Local and imported beliefs were fused and developed on Chinese soil, and when, in time, Buddhism was introduced it was mixed with pre-existing religious systems.",
    "Chinese Buddhism is consequently found to have local features that distinguish it from the Buddhism of Tibet, Burmah, and Japan, in which countries there was, in like manner, culture-mixing.",
    "Beliefs connected with jade, which date back to the time when the jade fished from the rivers of Chinese Turkestan was identified with pearls and gold, were similarly developed in China.",
    "At first the jade was used to assist birth and to cure diseases.",
    "It likewise brought luck, being an object that radiated the influence of the All-Mother.",
    "As the living had their days prolonged and their youth revived by jade, so were the dead preserved from decay by the influence of the famous mineral.",
    "The custom ultimately obtained of eating jade, as has already been noted in these pages.",
    "Ground jade or “pure extract of jade” was not only supposed to promote longevity, but to effect a ceremonial connection between the worshipper and the spirits or deities.",
    "In the Chou li it is stated that “when the Emperor purifies himself by abstinence, the chief in charge of the jade works prepares for him the jade which he is obliged to eat”.",
    "[372] It is explained by commentators that “the emperor fasts and purifies himself before communicating with the spirits; he must take the pure extract of jade; it is dissolved that he may eat it”.",
    "Jade was also pounded with rice as food for the corpse.",
    "“A marvellous kind of jade”, says Laufer, “was called Yü ying, ‘the perfection of jade’,” which ensured eternal life.",
    "“In 163 B.C. a jade cup of this kind was discovered on which the words were engraved ‘May the sovereign of men have his longevity prolonged’.”",
    "Immortality was secured by eating from jade bowls, or, as we have seen, by drinking dew from a jade bowl.",
    "[373] As has been shown, the Great Mother created jade for the benefit of mankind, and “the spirit of jade is like a beautiful woman”.",
    "[374] Jade was also “the essence of the purity of the male principle”.",
    "[375] Apparently the god who was husband and son of the Great Mother was connected with jade.",
    "The Mother was the life-giver, and the son, as Osiris, was “the imperishable principle of life wherever found”.",
    "[376] If men died, the seed of life in the body was preserved by jade amulets; the plants might shed their leaves, but the life of the plants was perpetuated by the spirit of jade.",
    "“In the second month”, says The Illustrated Mirror of Jade, “the plants in the mountains receive a brighter lustre.",
    "When their leaves fall, they change into jade.”",
    "[377] The mountain plants in question appear to be the curative herbs that contained, like jade, the elixir of life, and the chief of these plants was the ginseng (mandrake), an avatar of the Great Mother.",
    "The plant, or ground jade, or food or moisture from the jade vessel renewed youth and prolonged life.",
    "All the elixirs were concentrated in jade; the vital principle in human beings and plants was derived from and preserved by jade.",
    "It is of special interest to find that the Chinese Nu Kwa who caused the flood to retreat was the creator of the jade which protected mankind and ensured longevity by preserving the seed or shen of life, being impregnated with Yang, the male principle.",
    "In Babylonia, the seed of mankind was preserved during the flood by the nig-gil-ma.",
    "In the Sumerian version of the Creation legend, the three great gods Anu, Enlil, and Enki, assisted by the Great Mother goddess Ninkharasagga, first created mankind, then the nig-gil-ma, and lastly the four-legged animals of the field.",
    "The mysterious nig-gil-ma is referred to in the story of the Deluge as “Preserver of the seed of mankind”, while the ship or ark is “Preserver of Life”, literally “She that preserves life”.",
    "A later magical text refers to the creation after that of mankind and animals of “two small creatures, one white and one black”.",
    "Man and animals were saved from the flood and the nig-gil-ma played its or their part “in ensuring their survival”.",
    "Leonard W. King, who has gathered together the surviving evidence regarding the mysterious nig-gil-ma [378] points out that the name is sometimes preceded by “the determinative for ‘pot’, ‘jar’, or ‘bowl’”, and is identical with the Semitic word mashkhalu.",
    "In the Tell-el-Amarna letters there are references to a mashkhalu of silver and a mashkhalu of stone (a silver vessel and a stone vessel).",
    "The nig-gil-ma may be simply a “jar” or “bowl”.",
    "“But”, says Mr. L. King, “the accompanying references to the ground, to its production from the ground, and to its springing up ... suggest rather some kind of plant; and this, from its employment in magical rites, may also have given its name to a bowl or vessel which held it.",
    "A very similar plant was that found and lost by Gilgamesh, after his sojourn with Ut-napishtim [379]; it too had potent magical power, and bore a title descriptive of its peculiar virtue of transforming old age to youth.”",
    "The nig-gil-ma may therefore be a plant, a ship, a stone bowl or jar, or a vessel of silver (the moon metal).",
    "If we regard it as a symbol or avatar of the mother-goddess it was any of these things and all of these things—the Mother Pot, the inexhaustible womb of Nature, the Plant of Life containing “soul substance”, the red clay, the moon-silver, or, as in China, the jade of which the sacred vessel was made.",
    "The Great Mother’s herb-avatar was the ginseng (mandrake), as in the Egyptian Deluge story it was the red earth didi from Elephantine placed in the beer prepared for the slaughtering goddess Hathor-Sekhet as a surrogate of blood and a soporific drink; the mixture was “the giver of life”, the red aqua vitae, like the red wine and the juice of red berries in different areas.",
    "[380] The mandrake was the didi of southern Europe and of China.",
    "Dr. Rendel Harris shows that the early Greek magicians and doctors referred to the male mandrake, which was white, and the female mandrake, which was black.",
    "The black mandrake was personified as the Black Aphrodite.",
    "[381] The Babylonian reference in a magical text to the nig-gil-ma as “two small creatures, one white and one black” is therefore highly significant.",
    "Apparently, like jade, the nig-gil-ma symbolized “the male principle”, and “the spirit” of “a beautiful woman”.",
    "Thus mandrake (ginseng), the Plant of Life, red earth, jade, the pearl and the pot or jar or bowl, and the Deluge ship, and the ship of the sun-god, were forms, avatars, or manifestations of the Great Mother who preserved the seed of mankind and the elixir of life—in the Pot it grew the Plant of Life, and from it could be drunk the dew of life, the water of life, plant and water being impregnated with the “spirit” of jade.",
    "Jade-lore is of highly complex character because, as has been indicated, the early instructors of the Chinese attached to the mineral the Egypto-Babylonian doctrines regarding the Great Mother and her shells, pearls, precious stones, gold, silver and copper, herbs, trees, cereals, red earth, &c.",
    "The Babylonian evidence regarding the nig-gil-ma as a herb, and as a silver or stone jar, pot, or cup, in which was preserved the seed of mankind (“soul substance”) may explain why in the Chinese Deluge myth there is no ark or ship.",
    "The goddess provided jade instead of a boat",
    "and she created dragons to control the rain-supply, so that the world might not again suffer from the effects of a flood.",
    "The virtues of jade were shared to a certain degree by rhinoceros horn, which, as we have seen, was reputed to shine by night.",
    "Laufer has gathered together sufficient evidence to prove that the rhinoceros was one of the wild animals known in ancient China.",
    "[382] A hero of the Chou Dynasty, who subdued rebels and established peace throughout the Empire, “drove away also the tigers, leopards, rhinoceroses and elephants—and all the people were greatly delighted”.",
    "[383] A native writer says: “To travel by water and not avoid sea-serpents and dragons—this is the courage of a fisherman.",
    "To travel by land and not avoid the rhinoceros and the tiger—this is the courage of hunters.”",
    "In ancient times certain of the lords attending on the emperor had a tiger symbol on each chariot wheel, while other lords had on their wheels crouching rhinoceroses.",
    "[384] Laufer expresses the view that “the strong desire prevailing in the epoch of the Chou for the horn of the animal (rhinoceros) which was carved into ornamental cups, and for its valuable skin, which was worked up into armour, had ... contributed to its final destruction.”",
    "[385] The rhinoceros-horn cups were used, like jade cups, chiefly for religious purposes.",
    "Rice-wine was drunk from them when vows were made, and from them were poured libations to ancestors.",
    "The animal’s skin was used not only for armour, because of its toughness and durability, but because the rhinoceros was a longevity animal, and a form of the god of longevity (shou-sing).",
    "It was used, too, for the coffin of the “Son of Heaven” (the Emperor).",
    "“The innermost coffin was formed by hide of water buffalo and rhinoceros.”",
    "This case was enclosed in white poplar timber and the two outer cases were of catalpa wood.",
    "[386] The jade coffin was similarly a protecting life-giver.",
    "As there were black and white nig-gil-ma, and black and white deities, so were there black and white rhinoceroses and black and white elephants.",
    "Gautama Buddha entered his mother’s right side “in the form of a superb white elephant”.",
    "[387] The water-rhinoceros had “pearl-like armour” (a significant comparison when it is remembered that pearl-lore and jade-lore are so similar), but not the mountain rhinoceros.",
    "It was the horn of the male animal that had special virtues.",
    "The markings on it included a red line, which was a result of his habit of gazing at the moon; the spots were stars.",
    "As the animal was connected with the “material sky”, the horn was impregnated with the Yang principle.",
    "A horn that “communicated with the sky” was of the “first quality”.",
    "Laufer quotes the statement: “If the horn of the rhinoceros ‘communicating with the sky’ emits light, so that it can be seen by night, it is called ‘horn shining at night’ (ye ming si): hence it can communicate with the spirits and open a way through the water”.",
    "A man who carried in his mouth a piece of rhinoceros horn found, it was alleged, on diving into the sea, that the water gave way so as to allow a space for breathing.",
    "[388] The pearl-fishers may therefore have used the magic horn, believing that it protected and assisted them.",
    "It is recorded of a horn presented to an emperor of the Tʼang Dynasty that “at night it emitted light so that a space of a hundred paces was illuminated.",
    "Manifold silk wrappers laid around it could not hide its luminous power.",
    "The emperor ordered it to be cut into slices and worked up into a girdle; and whenever he went out on a hunting expedition, he saved candle light at night.”",
    "With the aid of the horn it was possible “to see supernatural monsters in water”.",
    "[389] There was warm rhinoceros horn and cold rhinoceros horn, as there was warm jade and cold jade.",
    "A Chinese work of the eighth century mentions “cold-dispelling rhinoceros horn (pi han si), whose colour is golden.",
    "[390]...",
    "During the winter months it spreads warmth which imparts a genial feeling to man.”",
    "Another work speaks of “heat-dispelling rhinoceros horn (pi shu si)....",
    "During the summer months it can cool off the hot temperature.”",
    "Girdles of “wrath-dispelling” horn caused men “to abandon their anger”; hair-pins, combs, &c., were made from “dust dispelling” horn.",
    "Rhinoceros horn had, like jade, healing properties.",
    "A fourth-century Chinese writer tells that “the horn can neutralize poison because the animal devours all sorts of vegetable poisons with its food”.",
    "Chinese drug stores still stock shavings of the horn to cure fever, smallpox, ophthalmia, &c.",
    "[391] According to S. W. Williams [392] “a decoction of the horn shavings is given to women just before parturition and also to frighten children”.",
    "A medicine is prepared from rhinoceros skin, too.",
    "Laufer states that “the skin, as well as the horn, the blood, and the teeth, were medicinally employed in Cambodja, notably against heart diseases....",
    "In Japan rhinoceros horn is powdered and used as a specific in fever cases of all kind.”",
    "Dragon bones were used in like manner in China.",
    "It is of importance to note that the rhinoceros horn derived its healing qualities because the animal fed on plants and trees provided with thorns.",
    "[393] Like the dragon, the rhinoceros had an intimate connection with certain plants; like the ginseng-devouring goat, it carried in its blood the virtue of the plants and herbs it devoured.",
    "In Tibet and China the rhinoceros became confused with the stag, antelope, and goat with one horn.",
    "It was the prototype of the unicorn.",
    "In India and Iran it was confused with the horse.",
    "There is in Chinese lore a “spiritual rhinoceros (ling si)” with the body of an ox, the hump of a zebu, cloven feet, the snout of a pig, and a horn in front.",
    "[394] It may be that in ancient times the lore connected with the hippopotamus was transferred by the searchers for pearls, precious stones, and metals to the Chinese “water-rhinoceros”.",
    "Like the composite wonder-beast in the Osirian hall of judgment, which tore the unworthy soul to pieces, the rhinoceros had its place in judicial proceedings in China.",
    "In its goat form it solved a difficult case when Kas Yas administered justice by butting the guilty party and sparing the innocent.",
    "[395] The importance attached to jade in prehistoric Europe raises an interesting problem.",
    "Jade artifacts have been found associated with the Swiss lake-dwellings, and at “Neolithic sites” in Brittany and Ireland, as well as in Malta and Sicily, and other parts of Europe.",
    "Schliemann found votive axes of green and white jade (nephrite) in the stratum of the first city of Troy.",
    "It was believed at the time that the European jade artifacts had been imported from the borders of China, and Professor Fischer expressed the wish “that before the end of his life the fortune might be allotted to him of finding out what people brought them to Europe”.",
    "[396] Professor Max Muller believed that the Aryans were the carriers of jade.",
    "“If”, he wrote, “the Aryan settlers could carry with them into Europe so ponderous a tool as their language, without chipping a single facet, there is nothing so very surprising in their having carried along and carefully preserved from generation to generation so handy and so valuable an instrument as a scraper or a knife, made of a substance which is Aere perennuis”.",
    "[397] After a prolonged search, European scientists have located nephrite (jade proper) or jadeite in situ in Silesia, Austria, North Germany, Italy, and among the Alps.",
    "“A sort of nephrite workshop was discovered in the vicinity of Maurach (Switzerland), where hatchets chiselled from the mineral and one hundred and fifty-four pieces of cuttings were found.”",
    "[398] Laufer writes in this connection: “If we consider how many years, and what strenuous efforts it required for European scientists to discover the actual sites of jade in Central Europe, which is geographically so well explored, we may realize that it could not have been quite such an easy task for primitive man to hunt up these hidden places”.",
    "Laufer thinks that in undertaking to overcome the difficulties experienced in discovering jade in Europe, early man “must have been prompted by a motive pre-existing and acting in his mind; the impetus of searching for jade he must have received somehow from somewhere....",
    "Nothing”, he says, “could induce me to believe that primitive man of Central Europe incidentally and spontaneously embarked on the laborious task of quarrying and working jade.",
    "The psychological motive for this act must be supplied....",
    "From the standpoint of the general development of culture in the Old World there is absolutely no vestige of originality in the prehistoric cultures of Europe which appear as an appendix to Asia.”",
    "[399] Apparently the “psychological motive” for searching for jade in China and Europe came from the Khotan area in Chinese Turkestan, whence jade was carried to Babylonia during the Sumerian period.",
    "It is probable that bronze was first manufactured in the jade-bearing area of Asia, and that the people who carried “the knowledge of bronze-making into Europe”, as Professor Elliot Smith suggests, “also introduced the appreciation of jade”.",
    "Laufer comments in this connection: “Originality is certainly the rarest thing in the world, and in the history of mankind the original thoughts are appallingly sparse.",
    "There is, in the light of historical facts and experience, no reason to credit the prehistoric and early populations of Europe with any spontaneous ideas relative to jade.”",
    "After receiving jade and adopting the beliefs attached to it, they set out to search for it, and found it in Europe.",
    "The polished axe pendants of jade found in Malta were evidently charms.",
    "Among the Greeks jade was “the kidney stone”; it cured diseases of the kidneys.",
    "The Spaniards brought jade or jadeite from Mexico, and called it “the loin stone” (piedra de hijada).",
    "Sir Walter Raleigh introduced it into England, and used the Spanish name from which “jade” is derived.",
    "Red, green, blue, white, grey, and black jade were used, by reason of their colours, for various deities in China, and to indicate the rank of officials.",
    "“White jade, considered the most precious, was the privileged ornament of the emperor; jade green like the mountains was reserved for the princes of the first and second ranks; water-blue jade was for the great prefects; the heir apparent had a special kind of jade.”",
    "[400] Mottled jades—some resembling granite—were likewise favoured for a variety of purposes.",
    "Jade played an important part in Chinese rain-getting ceremonies.",
    "Dragon jade symbols, decorated with fish-scales, were placed on the altar as offerings and for the purpose of invoking the rain-controlling “composite wonder beast” and god.",
    "Sometimes bronze and silver dragon symbols were used.",
    "According to Laufer, “the jade image of the dragon remained restricted to the Han period, and was substituted at later ages by prayers inscribed on jade or metal tablets.",
    "A survival of the ancient custom”, he adds, “may be seen in the large paper or papier mâché figures of dragons carried around in the streets by festival processions in times of drought to ensure the benefit of rain.”",
    "[401] In front of these dragons are carried the red ball, which symbolizes the moon, the source of fertilizing moisture—of dew, of rain, and therefore of the streams and rivers that flow to the sea.",
    "Jade links with pearls in the ocean surrounding the world, in which lies a gigantic oyster that gapes after rain falls, and sends forth the gleaming rainbow.",
    "The Greek historian, Isidorus of Charace (c. 300 B.C.), referring to the pearl-fishing in the Persian Gulf, relates a story about the breeding of pearls being influenced by thunder-storms.",
    "[402] The jade ceremonial object, which roused the dragon, had thus indirectly a share in pearl production.",
    "Pearls were, as we have seen, likewise produced by dragons, who spat them out during storms.",
    "As certain pearls were supposed to be formed by dew that dropped from the moon, it may be that the Chinese gigantic oyster was, when it gaped to send forth the rainbow, receiving the substance of a gigantic pearl from the celestial regions.",
    "The life-prolonging and youth-renewing “Red Cloud herb” came into existence during a thunder- and rain-storm.",
    "As we have seen, jade contains, according to Far Eastern belief, the essence of heat as well as of moisture.",
    "It contains, too, the essence of cold—not the cold of winter but the coolness desired in hot weather.",
    "[403] In the Tu yang tsa pien, a Chinese work of the ninth century, it is recorded that the Emperor of China received from Japan “an engraved gobang board of warm jade, on which the game could be played in winter without getting cold, and that it was most highly prized”.",
    "It is told in this connection that “thirty thousand li (leagues) east of Japan is the island of Tsi-mo, and upon this island the Ninghia Terrace, on which terrace is the Gobang Player’s Lake.",
    "This lake produces the chess-men which need no carving, and are naturally divided into black and white.",
    "They are warm in winter, cool in summer, and known as cool and warm jade.",
    "It also produces the catalpa-jade, in structure like the wood of the catalpa tree, which is carved into chess-boards, shining and brilliant as mirrors.”",
    "[404] Jade is, in short, a “luck stone”: the giver of children, health, immortality, wisdom, power, victory, growth, food, clothing, &c.",
    "It is “the jewel that grants all desires” in this world and the next, and is therefore connected with all religious beliefs, while it also plays its part as a symbol in the social organization, being the medium through which the mysterious forces of nature exercise their influence in every sphere of human thought and activity.",
    "CHAPTER XIV CREATION MYTHS AND THE GOD AND GODDESS CULTS Are Animistic Beliefs Primitive?—Evidence of a Mummy-imported Culture in Primitive Communities—Chinese Creation Myth—Chaos Transformed into Kosmos—Pʼan Ku as the World-artisan—Chinese World-giant Myth—Tibetan Version—Pʼan Ku and the Egyptian Ptah—Hammer Gods—Pʼan Ku and the Scandinavian Ymir—Osiris as a World-giant—Fusion of Egyptian and Babylonian Myths—The Chinese Ishtars—The Goddess of the Deluge—The Chinese Virgin Mother—Dragon Boat Ceremonies—The Mountain Goddess in China—Kiang Yuan as the Divine Mother—Ancient Myths in Chinese Buddhism—The “Poosa” as Goddess of Mercy—As Controller of Tides—Vision of Sky-goddess—Island Seat of Goddess Worship—The Chinese Indra.",
    "Although some exponents of the stratification theory incline to regard Chinese religion as a stunted outcrop of animistic ideas, and chiefly because of the remarkable persistence through the ages of the worship of ancestors—the worship of ghost-gods and ghosts identified with gods—there is really little trace of what is usually referred to as “the primitive state of mind”.",
    "Under the term “animism” have been included ideas that are less primitive than was supposed to be the case about a generation ago.",
    "The belief, for instance, that there are spirits in stones, or that the soul of the dead enters a megalithic monument, or a statue placed in the tomb, may not, after all, belong to a primitive stage of thought; nor does it follow that because it is found to be prevalent among savage tribes isolated on lonely islands it is a product merely of the early “workings of the human mind” when man, as if by instinct, framed his “first crude philosophy of human thought”.",
    "The fact that savages reached isolated islands, such as, for instance, Eastern Island, where stone idols were erected, indicates clearly that they had acquired a knowledge of shipbuilding and navigation directly or indirectly from a centre of ancient civilization.",
    "It may be, therefore, that they likewise acquired from the same source ideas regarding the soul and the origin of things, and that these, instead of being “simple” and “primitive”, are really of complex character, and have remained in a state of arrested development, simply because they have been detached from the parent stem, to be preserved like flower petals pressed in a book, that still retain a degree of their original brightness and characteristic odour.",
    "In outlying areas, like Australia and Oceania, are found not only “primitive beliefs”, but definite burial customs that have a long history elsewhere, including cremation and even mummification.",
    "“You get the whole bag of tricks in Australia”, the late Andrew Lang once declared to the writer when contending that certain beliefs and customs found in Egypt, Babylonia, India, and Europe were “natural products of the primitive mind”.",
    "But is it likely that such a custom as mummification should have “arisen independently” in Australasia?",
    "Let us take, for instance, the case of the mummy from the Torres Straits, which is preserved in the Mackay Museum in the University of Sydney.",
    "It was examined by Professor G. Elliot Smith, who, during his ten years’ occupancy of the Chair of Anatomy in the Government School of Medicine in Cairo, had unique opportunities of studying Ancient Egyptian surgery as revealed by the mummies preserved in Gizeh museum.",
    "When he examined the Papuan mummy at Sydney he found that undeniable Egyptian methods of a definite period in Egyptian history had been employed.",
    "He communicated his discovery to the Anthropological Section of the British Association in Melbourne in 1914, and, as an anatomist, was astonished to hear Professor Myres contending that it seemed to him natural that people should want to preserve their dead!",
    "“If”, Professor Elliot Smith has written, “Professor Myers had known anything of the history of anatomy he would have realized that the problem of preserving the body was one of extreme difficulty which for long ages had exercised the most civilized peoples, not only of antiquity, but also of modern times.",
    "In Egypt, where the natural conditions favouring the successful issue of attempts to preserve the body were largely responsible for the possibility of such embalming, it took more than seventeen centuries of constant practice and experimentation to reach the stage and to acquire the methods exemplified in the Torres Straits mummies.”",
    "[405] Arm-chair theories vanish like mist when the light of scientific evidence is released.",
    "In like manner may be found in the folk-lore and religious literature of China “mummies” of imported myths, as well as early myths of local invention that, ancient as they may be, cannot be regarded as “primitive” in the real sense of the term.",
    "The following myth, found in the literature of Taoism, may be more archaic than the writings of Kwang-tze, who gives it.",
    "At the beginning of time there were two oceans—one in the south and one in the north, and there was land in the centre.",
    "The Ruler of the southern ocean was Shu (Heedless), and the Ruler of the northern ocean was Hu (Hasty), while the Ruler of the Centre was Hwun-tun (Chaos).",
    "“Heedless” and “Hasty” were in the habit of paying regular visits to the land, and there they met and became acquainted.",
    "“Chaos” treated them kindly, and it was their desire to confer upon him some favour so as to give practical expression to their feelings of gratitude.",
    "They discussed the matter together, and decided what they should do.",
    "Now Chaos was blind, his eyes being closed, and he was deaf, his ears being closed, and he could not breathe, having no nostrils, nor eat, because he was mouthless.",
    "“Hasty” and “Heedless” met daily in the Central land, and each day they opened an orifice.",
    "On the seventh day their work was finished.",
    "But when he had eyes and ears opened, and could see and hear, and could breathe through his nostrils, and had a mouth with which to eat, old Chaos died.",
    "The meaning of this Chinese parable seems to be that the Universe had, in the space of seven days, been “set in order”, Chaos having been transformed into Kosmos.",
    "Although Taoism has been referred to by some writers of the “Evolution School” as “an elaboration of animistic lore”, this myth is really a product of the years that bring the philosophic mind.",
    "The three “Rulers” may have originally been giants, and the story may owe something to the Babylonian myth of Ea-Oannes, the sea-god, who came daily from the Persian Gulf to instruct the early Sumerians how to live civilized lives; but it was evidently some Far Eastern Socrates who first named the sea-gods “Heedless” and “Hasty”, and tinged the fable with Taoistic cynicism.",
    "Creation myths are not as “primitive” as some writers would have us suppose.",
    "Considerable progress was achieved before mankind began to theorize regarding the origin of things.",
    "Even the widespread and so-called “primitive myth” about the egg from which the Universe, or the first god, was hatched by the “Primeval Goose” may belong to a much later stage of human development than is supposed by some of those writers who speculate with so much confidence regarding “the workings of the human mind”.",
    "Even the metaphysicians of Brahmanic India were prone to speak in parables and fables.",
    "“At the beginning there was nothing”, the Chinese philosophers taught their pupils.",
    "“Long ages passed by.",
    "Then nothing became something.”",
    "The something had unity.",
    "Long ages passed by, and the something divided itself into two parts—a male part and a female part.",
    "These two somethings produced two lesser somethings, and the two pairs, working together, produced the first being, who was named Pʼan Ku.",
    "Another version of the myth is that Pʼan Ku emerged from the cosmic egg.",
    "It is not difficult to recognize in Pʼan Ku a giant god or world-god.",
    "He was furnished with an adze, or, as is found in some Chinese prints, with a hammer and a chisel.",
    "With his implement or implements Pʼan Ku moves through the universe as the Divine Artisan, who shapes the mountains and hammers or chisels out the sky, accompanied by the primeval Tortoise, and the Phœnix, and a dragon-like being who may represent the primeval “somethings”—the symbols of water, earth, and air.",
    "The sun, moon, and stars have already appeared.",
    "Another version of the Pʼan Ku myth represents him as the Primeval World-giant, who is destroyed so that the material universe may be formed.",
    "From his flesh comes the soil, from his bones the rocks; his blood is the waters of rivers and the ocean; his hair is vegetation; while the wind is his breath, the thunder his voice, the rain his sweat, the dew his tears, the firmament his skull, his right eye the moon, and his left eye the sun.",
    "Pʼan Ku’s body was covered with vermin, and the vermin became the races of mankind.",
    "A somewhat similar myth is found in Tibet.",
    "When M. Huc sojourned in that country, he had a conversation with an aged nomad, who said: “There are on the earth three great families, and we are all of the great Tibetan family.",
    "This is what I have heard the Lamas say, who have studied the things of antiquity.",
    "At the beginning there was on the earth only a single man; he had neither house nor tent, for at that time the winter was not cold, and the summer was not hot; the wind did not blow so violently, and there fell neither snow nor rain; the tea grew of itself on the mountains, and the flocks had nothing to fear from beasts of prey.",
    "This man had three children, who lived a long time with him, nourishing themselves on milk and fruits.",
    "After having attained to a great age, this man died.",
    "The three children deliberated what they should do with the body of their father, and they could not agree about it; one wished to put him in a coffin, the other wanted to burn him, the third thought it would be best to expose the body on the summit of a mountain.",
    "They resolved then to divide it into three parts.",
    "The eldest had the body and arms; he was the ancestor of the great Chinese family, and that is why his descendants have become celebrated in arts and industry, and are remarkable for their tricks and stratagems.",
    "The second son had the breast; he was the father of the Tibetan family, and they are full of heart and courage, and do not fear death.",
    "From the third, who had inferior parts of the body, are descended the Tartars, who are simple and timid, without head or heart, and who know nothing but how to keep themselves firm in their saddles.”",
    "[406] Pʼan Ku, with his implements, links with the Egyptian artificer god Ptah of Memphis, who used his hammer to beat out the metal firmament.",
    "Ptah’s name means “to open” in the sense of “to engrave, to carve, to chisel”; the sun and moon were his eyes; he was “the great artificer in metals, and he was at once smelter, and caster, and sculptor, as well as the master architect and designer of everything that exists in the world”.",
    "In the Book of the Dead he (or Shu) is said to have performed “the ceremony of opening the mouth of the gods with an iron knife”, [407] as “Hasty” and “Heedless” opened the mouth, eyes, ears, and nostrils of Chaos in the Chinese myth.",
    "The high priest of Memphis was called Ur Kherp hem, “the great chief of the hammer”.",
    "As we have seen, he was closely associated with the Egyptian potter’s wheel, which reached China at an early period.",
    "Like Ptah, Pʼan Ku is sometimes depicted as a dwarf, and sometimes as a giant.",
    "Other hammer-gods include the Aryo-Indian Indra, who builds the world house; the Anatolian Tarku, the Mesopotamian Rammon or Adad, the northern European Thor.",
    "The hammer is apparently identical with adze and axe, and in Egypt the axe is an exceedingly ancient symbol of a deity; in Crete the double axe has a similar significance.",
    "In Scotland the hammer is carried by the Cailleach (Old Wife) in her character as Queen of Winter; she shapes the mountains with it, and causes the ground to freeze hard when she beats it.",
    "The hammer-god is in many countries a thunderer; to the modern Greeks lightning flashes are caused by blows of the “sky-axe” (astro-peléki); in Scottish Gaelic mention is made of the “thunder-ball” (peleir-tarnainach).",
    "A thunder-ball is carried by the Japanese thunder-god, but it is often replaced by the thunder-drum.",
    "Pʼan Ku plays no conspicuous part in Chinese mythology; he is evidently an importation.",
    "In his character as a world-god he resembles the primeval giant Ymir of Norse-Icelandic myth, who was similarly cut up or ground in the “World Mill”, so that the universe might be set in order.",
    "From the flesh of Ymir the world was formed, From his blood the billows of the sea, The hills from his bones, the trees from his hair, The sphere of heaven from his skull.",
    "Out of his brows the blithe powers made Midgarth for sons of men, And out of his brains were the angry clouds All shaped above in the sky.",
    "[408] Ymir was, like Pʼan Ku, born from inanimate matter.",
    "He was nourished by Audhumbla (Darkness and Vacuity), the cow mother, the Scandinavian Hathor.",
    "From stormy billow sprang poison drops, Which waxed into Jotum (giant) form, And from him are come the whole of our Kin; All fierce and dread is that race.",
    "[409] Another version of the Ymir myth makes the giant come into existence like the self-created Ptah: ’Twas the earliest of times when Ymir lived; Then was sand, nor sea, nor cooling wave, Nor was Earth found even, nor Heavens on high; There was Yawning of Deeps, and nowhere grass.",
    "[410] The black dwarfs were parasites on Ymir’s body, as human beings were parasites on the body of Pʼan Ku.",
    "It may be that the idea of a primeval giant like Pʼan Ku, or Ymir, was derived from the conception of Osiris as a world-god, which obtained in Egypt as far back as the Empire period.",
    "Erman translates a hymn in which it is said of the god: “The soil is on thy arm, its corners are upon thee as far as the four pillars of the sky.",
    "When thou movest, the earth trembles....",
    "[411] The Nile comes from the sweat of thy hands.",
    "Thou spewest out the wind that is in thy throat into the nostrils of men, and that whereon men live is divine.",
    "It is [412]",
    "[alike in] in thy nostrils, the tree and its verdure, reeds, plants, barley, wheat, and the tree of life.”",
    "Everything constructed on earth lies on the “back” of Osiris.",
    "“Thou art the father and mother of men, they live on thy breath, they eat of the flesh of thy body.",
    "The ‘Primæval’ is thy name.”",
    "[413] The body of Osiris was cut into pieces by Set.",
    "As the bones of Pʼan Ku and Ymir are the rocks, so are the bones of Set the iron found in the earth, but no myth survives of the cutting up of Set’s body.",
    "The black soil on the Nile banks is the body of Osiris, and vegetation springs from it.",
    "It may be, however, that it was in consequence of the fusion in some cultural centre of the Babylonian myth regarding the cutting up of the dragon Tiamat and the cutting up of the body of Osiris that the northern Europeans came to hear of an Ymir and the Chinese of a Pʼan Ku from the early traders in amber, jade, and metals.",
    "When Tiamat was slain, Marduk “smashed her skull”.",
    "He cut the channels of her blood, He made the North Wind bear it away into secret places....",
    "He split her up like a flat fish into two halves, One half of her he set in place as a covering for the heavens.",
    "With the other part of Tiamat’s body Marduk made the earth.",
    "Then he fashioned the abode of the god Ea in the deep, the abode of the god Anu in high heaven, and the abode of Enlil in the air.",
    "[414] In India is found another myth that appears to have contributed to the Chinese mosaic.",
    "At the beginning the Universal Soul assumed “the shape of a man”.",
    "This was Purusha.",
    "“He did not feel delight.",
    "Therefore nobody, when alone, feels delight.",
    "He was desirous of a second.",
    "He was in the same state as husband (Pati) and wife (Patni)....",
    "He divided this self two fold.",
    "Hence were husband and wife produced.",
    "Therefore was this only a half of himself, as a split pea is of the whole....",
    "The void was completed by woman.”",
    "[415] It may be that India and China derived the god-splitting idea from a common source in Central Asia, where such “culture-mixing” appears to have taken place.",
    "In China itself there are many traces of blended ideas.",
    "In the Texts of Confucianism, for instance, the symbol of the Khien stands for heaven, and that of the Khwan for earth.",
    "In one of the native treatises it is stated: “Khien suggests the idea of heaven; of a circle; of a ruler; of a father; of jade; of metal; of cold; of ice; of deep red; of a good horse; of an old horse; of a thin horse; of a piebald horse; and of the fruit of trees.",
    "“Khwan suggests the idea of the earth; of a mother; of cloth; of a caldron; of parsimony; of a turning lathe; of a young heifer; of a large waggon; of what is variegated; of a multitude; and of a handle and support.",
    "Among soils it denotes what is black.”",
    "[416] Here we have the Great Father, the god of heaven, who is red and is a circle (the sun); and the Great Mother, the goddess of Earth, who is black.",
    "The sky-god is connected with jade and metal.",
    "As we have seen, the cult of the west attributed the creation of jade to the Chinese Ishtar.",
    "Precious metals were in several countries associated with sun, moon, and stars.",
    "The horse is one of the animals associated with sky-gods; it was, of course, later than the bull, stag, antelope, goat, ram, &c. Cold as well as warmth was sent by the sky-god, who controls the seasons.",
    "The mother-goddess is the Caldron—the “Pot”, which, as has already been noted, was in Ancient Egypt the symbol of the inexhaustible womb of nature personified by deities like Hathor, Rhea, Aphrodite, Hera, Ishtar, &c.",
    "The “young heifer” has a similar connection, while the “waggon” seems to be another form of the “Pot”.",
    "Cloth was woven by men and women, but the production of thread was always the work of women in Ancient Egypt and elsewhere.",
    "Apparently the turning lathe was female, because the chisel was male; it may be that it was because the potter’s wheel was female that it had to be operated by a man.",
    "“A multitude” may refer to the reproductivity of the Great Mother of all mankind.",
    "The goddess was, perhaps, parsimonious because during a period of the year the earth gives forth naught, and stores all it receives.",
    "The egg from which Pʼan Ku emerged appears to have been a symbol of the Mother Goddess of the sacred West, remembered in Chinese legends as Si Wang Mu, “the mother of the Western King”, and in Japanese as Seiobo, who was guardian of the World Tree, the giant peach, or the lunar, cassia tree (Chapter X).",
    "Other references to her, under various names, are scattered through ancient Chinese writings.",
    "In the “Annals of the Bamboo Books” mention is made of “the Heavenly lady Pa”.",
    "She favoured the Chinese monarch, Hwang Ti, who is supposed to have reigned during 2688 B.C. by stopping “the extraordinary rains caused by the enemy”.",
    "[417] Here we seem to meet with a vague reference to the Deluge legend.",
    "The Babylonian Ishtar was angered at the gods for causing the flood and destroying mankind, as is gathered from the Gilgamesh epic: Then the Lady of the gods drew nigh, And she lifted up the great jewels",
    "[418] which Anu had made according to her wish (and said): “What gods these are!",
    "By the jewels of lapis lazuli which are upon my neck, I will not forget!",
    "These days I have set in my memory, never will I forget them!",
    "Let the gods come to the offering, But Bel shall not come to the offering, Since he refused to ask counsel and sent the deluge, And handed over my people unto destruction.”",
    "[419] A goddess who protests against the destruction of her human descendants by means of a flood, caused by the gods, was likely to protect them against “extraordinary rains”, caused by their human or demoniac enemies.",
    "As we have seen in previous chapters, the Chinese Deluge legend, in one of its forms, was attached to the memory of the mythical Empress Nu Kwa, the sister of the mythical Emperor Fuh-hi, sometimes referred to as “the Chinese Adam”.",
    "Three rebels had conspired with the demons or gods of water and fire to destroy the world, and a great flood came on.",
    "Nu Kwa caused the waters to retreat by making use of charred reeds (quite a Babylonian touch!).",
    "Then she re-erected one of the four pillars of the sky against which one of the rebels, a huge giant, had bumped his head, causing it to topple over.",
    "According to Chinese chronology, this world-flood occurred early in the “Patriarchal Period” between 2943 B.C. and 2868 B.C.",
    "Another reference to the mother-goddess crops up in a poem by “the statesman poet, Chu Yuan, 332–295 B.C., who drowned himself”, Professor Giles writes, [420] “in despair at his country’s outlook, and whose body is still searched for annually at the Dragon-boat Festival”.",
    "The poem in question is entitled “God Questions”, and one question is: “As Nu-Chi had no husband, how could she bear nine sons?”",
    "Professor Giles adds: “The Commentary tells us that Nu Chi was a ‘divine maiden’, but nothing more seems to be known about her”.",
    "It is evident that she was a virgin goddess, who, like the Egyptian Nut, was the spirit of the cosmic waters.",
    "[421] It is of interest to find the memory of the poet associated with the Dragon-boat Festival, which, according to Chinese belief, had origin because he drowned himself in the Ni-ro River.",
    "There is evidence, however, that the festival had quite another origin.",
    "Dragon-boats were used in China on the fifth day of the fifth month at water festivals.",
    "They were “big ships adorned with carved dragon ornaments”, the yih bird being painted on the prow.",
    "[422] De Visser says that these boats were used by emperors for pleasure trips, and music was played on board them.",
    "“The bird was painted, not to denote their swift sailing, but to suppress the water-gods.”",
    "[423] According to De Groot, dragon-boat races were “intended to represent fighting dragons in order to cause a real dragon fight, which is always accompanied by heavy rains.",
    "The dragon-boats carried through the streets may also serve to cause rain, although they are at the same time considered to be substitutes.”",
    "[424] Having drowned himself, the poet became associated with the river dragon.",
    "“Offerings of rice in bamboo”, says Giles, “were cast into the river as a sacrifice to the spirit of their great hero.”",
    "[425] In like manner, offerings were made to dragons in connection with rain-getting ceremonies long before the poet was born.",
    "It is evident that he took the place of the dragon-god as the mythical Empress Nu Kwa of the Patriarchial Period took the place of the Chinese Ishtar, and as Ishtar took the place of the earlier Sumerian goddess Ninkharasagga, who, with “Anu, Enlil, and Enki”, “created the black-headed (i.e. mankind)”.",
    "[426] The same Chinese poet sings of the mother-goddess in his poem, “The Genius of the Mountain”, which Professor Giles has translated: “Methinks there is a Genius of the Hills clad in wistaria, girdled with ivy, with smiling lips, of witching mien, riding on the red pard, wild cats galloping in the rear, reclining in a chariot, with banners of cassia, cloaked with the orchid, girt with azalea, culling the perfume of sweet flowers to leave behind a memory in the heart.”",
    "Like Ishtar, who laments for her lost Tammuz, this goddess laments for her “Prince”.",
    "“Dark is the grove wherein I dwell.",
    "No light of day reached it ever.",
    "The path thither is dangerous and difficult to climb.",
    "Alone I stand on hill-top, [427] while the clouds float beneath my feet, and all around is wrapped in gloom.”",
    "This goddess is not only associated with ivy, the cassia tree, &c., but with the pine.",
    "“I shade myself”, she sings, “beneath the spreading pine.”",
    "The poem concludes: “Now booms the thunder through the drizzling rain.",
    "The gibbons howl around me all the long night.",
    "The gale rushes fitfully through the whispering trees.",
    "And I am thinking of my Prince, but in vain; for I cannot lay my grief.”",
    "[428] The goddess laments for her prince, as does Ishtar for Tammuz.",
    "The mother-goddess is found also in the “Book of Odes” (The Shih King).",
    "She figures as the mother of the Hau-Ki and “the people of Kau” in the ode which begins as follows: “The first birth of (our) people was from Kian Yuan.",
    "How did she give birth to our people?",
    "She had presented a pure offering and sacrificed, that her childlessness might be taken away.",
    "She then trod on a toe-print made by God, and was moved in the large place where she rested.",
    "She became pregnant; she dwelt retired; she gave birth to and nourished (a son), who was Hau-Ki.”",
    "[429] Professor Giles refers to this birth-story “as an instance in Chinese literature, which, in the absence of any known husband, comes near suggesting the much-vexed question of parthenogenesis”.",
    "[430] Other Chinese references to miraculous conceptions, given below, emphasize how persistent in Chinese legend are the lingering memories of the ancient mother-goddess.",
    "As was the case in Babylonia and Egypt, the rival biological theories of the god cult and the goddess cult were fused or existed side by side in ancient China.",
    "The goddess cult influenced Buddhism even when it was adopted in China, and fused with local religious systems.",
    "To the lower classes the “Poosa”, who brings luck—that is, success and protection—may be either a Buddha or a goddess.",
    "The name is “a shortened form of the Sanskrit term Bodhisattwa”, and was originally “a designation of a class of Buddha’s disciples....",
    "The ‘Poosa’ feels more sympathy with the lower wants of men than the Buddha (Fuh) does.”",
    "One of the holy beings referred to in China as a “Poosa” is Kwan-yin, the so-called “goddess of mercy”.",
    "Dr. Joseph Edkins [431] says that “this divinity is represented sometimes as male, at others as female....",
    "She is often represented with a child in her arms, and is then designated the giver of children.",
    "Elsewhere she is styled the ‘Kwan-yin who saves from the eight forms of suffering’ or ‘of the southern sea’, or ‘of the thousand arms’, &c.",
    "She passes through various metamorphoses, which give rise to a variety in names.”",
    "The “Poosa” of Buddhism or the ancient Chinese faith is a powerful protector.",
    "Dr. Edkins tells that “Chinese worshippers will sometimes say, for example, that they must spend a little money occasionally to obtain a favour of Poosa, in order to prevent calamities from assailing them.",
    "I saw”, he relates, “an instance of this at a town on the sea-coast near Hangchow.",
    "The tide here is extremely destructive in the autumn.",
    "[432] It often overflows the embankment made to restrain it, and produces devastation in the adjoining cottages and fields.",
    "A temple was erected to the Poosa Kwan-yin, and offerings are regularly made to her, and prayers presented for protection against the tide.”",
    "A vision of this Chinese Aphrodite was beheld about two years before the British forces captured Canton.",
    "“The governor of the province to which that city belongs”, says Dr. Edkins, “was engaged in exterminating large bands of roving plunderers that disturbed the region under his jurisdiction.",
    "He wrote to the Emperor on one occasion a dispatch in which he said that, at a critical juncture in a recent contest, a large figure in white had been seen beckoning to the army from the sky.",
    "It was Kwan-yin.",
    "The soldiers were inspired with courage, and won an easy victory over the enemy.”",
    "Edkins notes that “the principal seat of the worship of Kwan-yin is at the island of Poots”.",
    "Here the deity “takes the place of Buddha, and occupies the chief position in the temples”.",
    "There are many small caves on the island dedicated to the use of hermits.",
    "“In several of them, high up on a hill-side”, Dr. Edkins “noticed a small figure of Buddha”.",
    "Here we have an excellent instance of “culture-mixing” in China in our own day.",
    "Shang-ti, the personal god who rules in the sky, is to the Chinese Buddhists identical with Indra, the Hindu god of thunder and rain.",
    "In India Indra was in Vedic times the king of the gods, but in the Brahmanic Age became a lesser being than Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu.",
    "When Buddha was elevated to the godhead these great deities shrank into minor positions.",
    "In China they stand among the auditors of the supreme Buddha, as he sits on the lotus flower, and “occupy”, as Edkins found, “a lower position than the personages called Poosa, Lohan, &c.”",
    "[433] In the next chapter it will be found that floating myths were attached to the memories of mythical and legendary monarchs in China, and that not a few of these myths resemble others found elsewhere.",

    "Pʼan Ku, the first “man” or “god”, was the ancestor of three families—the rulers of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind.",
    "In Tibet, as we have seen, the first man had three sons, who divided his body between them, and they were the ancestors of the three human races.",
    "Like the Babylonians, the Chinese had dynastic lists of antediluvian kings.",
    "Pʼan Ku’s descendants ruled the nine divisions of the prehistoric empire or world.",
    "There were ten dynastic periods, the first being that of the “Nine Heads” (kings), the second that of the “Five Dragons”, and so on.",
    "The five dragon kings were connected with the five planets: Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn, and therefore with the five elements, for Venus was the Star of Metal, Jupiter that of Wood, Mercury that of Water, Mars the Star of Fire, and Saturn the Star of Earth.",
    "Thus every part of the terrestrial surface, when identified with one or more elements on account of its shape, is under the influence of the corresponding metals, and also under that of the constellations through which these planets move.",
    "[434] As we have seen, the spirits of dragon swords appeared in the sky as stars.",
    "The star-gods, like the dragons, were fathers of some of the famous kings of China.",
    "Towards the end came the period “Having Nests”, which indicates that houses were built.",
    "Then came the period of Sui-zan, “the Fire-producer”, who has been referred to as the “Prometheus of China”.",
    "A new age was ushered in by Fu Hsia or Fu Hi, the so-called “Adam of China”.",
    "He is the first monarch of China’s legendary history, and was supposed to reign from 2953 till 2838 B.C.",
    "Some regard him as the leader of a colony which settled in Shensi.",
    "But he is more like a mythical culture hero.",
    "He was the offspring of a miraculous conception, and had dealings with dragons.",
    "Like the Babylonian Ea he instructed the people how to live civilized lives.",
    "Before Fu-hi came, they lived like animals; they knew their mothers but not their fathers, and they ate raw flesh.",
    "They kept records by means of knotted cords, and he instructed them in the mysteries of lineal figures, which had a mystic significance.",
    "These were eight in number—the eight kwâ or trigrams, which represented: (1) the sky; (2) water of lakes and marshes; (3) fire, lightning, and the sun; (4) thunder; (5) wind and wood; (6) water as in rain, springs, streams, clouds, and the moon; (7) a hill; (8) the earth.",
    "Fu-hi also instructed the people to worship spirits, and he instituted sacrifices.",
    "He kept in a park six kinds of animals, and sacrificed twice a year at the two solstices, causing the days to be regarded as sacred, so that the people might show gratitude to heaven.",
    "According to the Taoists, Fu-hi disturbed the primal unity, and caused the people to begin to deteriorate.",
    "Here we touch on the doctrine of the World’s Ages.",
    "Like the Indians of the Brahmanic period, the Chinese Taoists believed that the first age was a perfect one, and that mankind gradually deteriorated.",
    "In the Indian Krita Age “all men were saintly, and therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies....",
    "There were no gods in the Krita Age, and there were no demons.”",
    "[435] Lao Tze, who will be dealt with more fully in the next chapter, exclaims: “I would make people return to the use of knotted cords”.",
    "His disciple, Kwang Tze, lamented that the paradisaical state of the early ages had been disturbed by law-makers.",
    "Decadence set in with the “Prometheus” and the “Adam”, and continued until the people became “perplexed and disordered, and had no way by which they might return to their true nature, and bring back their original condition”.",
    "[436] “It is remarkable”, says Legge, “that at the commencement of Chinese history, Chinese tradition placed a period of innocence, a season when order and virtue ruled in men’s affairs.”",
    "This comment is made in connection with the following passage in the Shu King (Book XXVII, “The Marquis of Lu on Punishments”): “The King said, ‘According to the teachings of ancient times, Khih Yu was the first to produce disorder, which spread among the quiet, orderly people, till all became robbers and murderers, owl-like and yet self-complacent in their conduct, traitors and villains, snatching and filching, dissemblers and oppressors’”.",
    "[437] In some accounts of the early period, Fu Hi is succeeded by his sister, the Empress Nu Kwa, the heroine of the Deluge.",
    "Fu Hi’s usual successor, however, is Shen-nung (2838–2698 B.C.), the Chinese Osiris, who introduced the agricultural mode of life and instructed the people how to make use of curative herbs.",
    "He was worshipped as the god of agriculture.",
    "Thus an Ode sets forth: That my fields are in such good condition, Is matter of joy to my husbandmen.",
    "With lutes, and with drums beating, We will invoke the Father of Husbandry, And pray for sweet rain, To increase the produce of our millet fields, And to bless my men and their wives.",
    "[438] Shen-nung was not content with two annual sacrifices, and fixed two others at the equinoxes, “that in spring to implore a blessing on the fruit of the earth, and that in autumn, after the harvest was over, to offer the first fruits to the ruler of heaven”.",
    "After Shen-nung died the emperor Hwang-Ti (“The Yellow God”) ascended the throne.",
    "He was in the literal sense the “Son of Heaven”, for his real father was the thunder-god, and he had therefore “a dragon-like countenance”.",
    "As in the case of Osiris, who was reputed to have reigned over Egypt, it is difficult to conclude whether he was a deified monarch or a humanized deity.",
    "He belongs, of course, to the mythical period of the “five Tis” in Chinese legendary history.",
    "The account of his origin sets forth that one night his mother witnessed a brilliant flash of lightning which darted from the vicinity of the star chʼoo in the Great Bushel (the “Great Bear”) and lit up the whole country.",
    "Her Majesty became pregnant, but did not give birth to her son until twenty-five months later.",
    "Hwang Ti was able to speak as soon as he was born.",
    "When he ascended the throne, he possessed the power of summoning spirits to attend at the royal palace, and his allies in battle included tigers, panthers, and bears, as those of Rama, the hero of the Indian epic, the Rámáyana, included bears and gigantic monkeys.",
    "Hwang Ti was a lover of peace, and because he caused peaceful conditions to prevail, phœnixes nested in his garden, or, like swallows, perched on the palace roof and terraces and sang in the courtyard.",
    "Other spirit-birds haunted the residence of the “Yellow God”.",
    "He built a large temple so that he might not be prevented by bad weather from offering up sacrifices and performing other religious ceremonies at any season of the year, and he instructed the people in their duties towards the spirits, their ancestors, and himself.",
    "He fixed the holy days and introduced music in temple worship.",
    "His wife undertook the duty of nourishing silk-worms and producing silk.",
    "An enclosure on the north side of the temple was planted with mulberry trees, and in this grove the Empress and the ladies of her court attended to the silk-worms specially kept for the silk required for religious ceremonies.",
    "Her Majesty was the goddess as her husband was the god, and had therefore to promote reproduction and growth.",
    "She therefore visited also the enclosure on the southern side of the temple in which grew the cereals and fruits offered to the deities.",
    "Hwang Ti was specially favoured by the goddess known as “the heavenly lady Pao”, who on one occasion stopped the heavy and destructive rains that had been caused by the enemy.",
    "When the Emperor was in his seventy-seventh year, he retired from the world, like an Indian ascetic, to practise austerities beside the Jo water.",
    "He died in his one hundredth year.",
    "Some tell that when he was ascending to heaven an earthquake occurred; others hold that he never died but was transformed into a dragon.",
    "After he passed away, either as a soul or dragon, to associate with the immortals, a wooden image of him was made and worshipped by princes.",
    "His successor is said to have been the Emperor Che, whose dynastic title was Shao-Hao.",
    "This monarch was the son of a star god.",
    "One night his mother beheld a star, which resembled a rainbow, floating on a stream in the direction of a small island.",
    "After retiring to rest she dreamed that she received the star, and, in due course, she gave birth to her son.",
    "Phœnixes visited the royal palace on the day that he ascended the throne.",
    "This monarch had some mysterious association with the west—probably with the goddess of the west—and is said to have commanded an army of birds.",
    "He was followed by the Emperor Chuen-Heugh (Kao-Yang).",
    "He, too, was the son of a star-god.",
    "It chanced that his mother witnessed the Yao-Kwang star passing through the moon like a rainbow.",
    "She gave birth to her son in the vicinity of the Jo water.",
    "There was a shield and spear on his head at birth, a tradition which recalls that when the Indian princess Pritha gave birth to Karna, son of Surya, the sun-god, he was fully armed.",
    "Chuen-Heugh was a great sage.",
    "“He invented calendaric calculations and delineations of the heavenly bodies,” and composed a piece of music called “The Answer to the Clouds”.",
    "Next came the Emperor Kuh (Kao-sin) who, like Richard III, had teeth when he was born.",
    "He similarly rose from the rank of a State prince to the Imperial throne.",
    "The State of Yew-Kae was conquered by him.",
    "His son, named Che, proved to be unworthy, and his younger son, Yao, was selected as his successor.",
    "The Emperor Yao was the son of a red dragon, as well as of the Emperor, and was not born until fourteen months after conception.",
    "He is said to have been ten cubits in height when full grown.",
    "There were two pupils in each of his eyes.",
    "He was a great sage and wonderful happenings occurred during his reign.",
    "A mysterious grass grew on the palace stairs.",
    "It bore a pod on each day of the month.",
    "He selected as his colleague and successor the sage Shun, who had held an undistinguished position.",
    "It is told that this selection was approved by five star-gods whose spirits appeared as five old men and walked about among the islands of the River Ho.",
    "On another occasion a bright light came from the river; then beautifully-coloured vapours arose and a dragon-horse appeared, carrying in its mouth a scaly cuirass for Shun, whose appointment was thus definitely approved by Heaven.",
    "Thirty years later a tortoise rose from the water and rested on the altar.",
    "On its back was an inscribed order instructing Yao to resign in favour of Shun.",
    "This divine command was duly obeyed.",
    "Shun’s mother had conceived after seeing a rainbow.",
    "As has been stated, a rainbow was believed to emanate from the gigantic oyster that lay in mid ocean.",
    "When the child was born his mother and father detested him, because his body was black and his eyes had double pupils, and because he had a dragon face and a large mouth.",
    "When he became a youth he reached the height of six cubits, and was thus like the Egyptian Horus and the Norse hero Sigurd, a veritable giant.",
    "His parents endeavoured on more than one occasion to cause his death by giving him difficult tasks to perform, and acting treacherously towards him.",
    "On one occasion they ordered him to plaster a granary, and when he was engaged at the work they set fire to the building.",
    "But Shun was clad in “bird’s work clothing”, which seems to indicate that he had power to assume bird form, and he flew away.",
    "He was next ordered to deepen a well.",
    "He went to work obediently, and while engaged in his task the well was suddenly filled up with stones.",
    "But Shun had “dragon’s work clothing”, or was able to assume a dragon form, and contrived to escape through the side of the well.",
    "Like Hercules, he performed all his difficult tasks and escaped without injury.",
    "Although Shun is usually said to have been selected by Yaou as his successor, a vague tradition states that he dethroned Yaou by force and kept him a prisoner.",
    "Before long, however, he degraded the young ruler and took his place.",
    "On ascending the throne, Shun publicly worshipped the spirit of Shang Ti (Ruler of Heaven, the personal god).",
    "He enacted new laws, so that the government of the Empire might be regulated and strengthened, and he was the first monarch to create Mandarins.",
    "Shun is credited with selecting his successor Yu.",
    "The Emperor Yu was the first monarch of the Dynasty of Hea.",
    "According to tradition he was the son of a star-god.",
    "It is told that one night his mother saw a falling star and became pregnant.",
    "She afterwards swallowed a pearl that had been dropped by a spirit.",
    "In due course she gave birth to Yu.",
    "A similar myth is attached to the memory of the Irish Christian saint Ciaran of Saigir, which was probably taken over from some ancient Celtic hero, the son or grandson of Sirona (the aged one or star-goddess).",
    "A Gaelic poem, believed to have been composed in the ninth century, sets forth: Liadaine (his mother) was asleep On her bed (a saying not wrong).",
    "When she turned her face to heaven A star fell into her mouth.",
    "Thence was born the marvellous child, Ciaran of Saigir who is proclaimed to thee And thence (a saying without pride)",
    "Luaigne (Liadaine’s husband) said he (Ciaran) was not his son.",
    "[439] Osiris, as the son of the cow-goddess, was a son of the moon, from which fell a fertilizing ray of light.",
    "The Egyptian deities had star forms.",
    "As stars, they rose from malachite pools and perched in swallow-shape on the branches of the world-tree of the Great Mother.",
    "Hathor and Isis were personified as the star Sirius, from which fell the tear, or drop of dew, that caused the low Nile to have increase and rise in flood.",
    "As the morning star, the goddess was the mother of the rising sun.",
    "Much star-lore surviving from ancient times remains to be gleaned.",
    "When the star-deity’s son, the Chinese Emperor Yu, was born, he had the mouth of a tiger.",
    "“His ears had three orifices; his head bore the resemblance of the star Kow and Kʼeen.",
    "On his breast seemed a figure in gem of the Great Bear.”",
    "When he grew up he reached the height of 9 cubits, 6 inches.",
    "[440] The Irish hero, Cuchullin, was likewise a marvellous youngster.",
    "He had “seven toes to each foot, and to either hand as many fingers; his eyes were bright, with seven pupils apiece”, and so on.",
    "Yu was probably a historical character, to whose memory many floating myths and legends were attached.",
    "He figures as the hero of a deluge.",
    "One night, during his youth, he dreamt that while bathing in the Ho (the Yellow River)",
    "he drank up the water.",
    "He also beheld a white fox with nine tails—a particularly good omen.",
    "This was during the reign of Yau.",
    "Shun came to know about him and showed him special favour, causing him to be promoted until he became an influential man in the Empire.",
    "The gods were well pleased because he was loved by them.",
    "One day, as Yu stood on the banks of the River Ho, gazing at the water, a god appeared as a tall, white-faced man, with the body of a fish, like the Babylonian Ea.",
    "He addressed Yu and said: “I am the spirit of the Ho.",
    "Wan-ming shall regulate the waters.”",
    "The god then gave Yu a plan of the Ho, which gave full details regarding the regulating of the waters, and sank into the river.",
    "A good deal of controversy has been engaged in as to what Yu was supposed to have done.",
    "In the Shu King (“The Tribute of Yu” chapter) it is stated: “Yu divided the land, following the course of the hills, he cut down the trees.",
    "He determined the highest hills and largest rivers (in the several regions)....",
    "The (waters of the) Hang and Wei were brought to their proper channels.”",
    "Other rivers were similarly controlled.",
    "[441] In another section Yu says: “When the floods were lifted to the heavens, spreading far and wide, surrounding the hills and submerging the mounds, so that the common people were bewildered and dismayed, I availed myself of four vehicles, [442] and going up the hills I felled the trees....",
    "After that I drained off the nine channels, directing them into the four seas; I dug out ditches and canals and brought them into rivers.”",
    "[443] In the fourth book of the Shu King, “The Great Plan”, it is said: “I have heard that in old time Khwan dammed up the inundating waters, and thereby threw into disorder the arrangement of the five elements.",
    "God was consequently roused to anger, and did not give him the Great Plan with its nine divisions, and thus the unvarying principles (of Heaven’s method) were allowed to go to ruin.”",
    "[444] In one of the Odes it is stated that “when the waters of the Deluge spread vast abroad, Yu arranged and divided the regions of the land”.",
    "[445] It has been suggested by some that Yu constructed a great embankment to prevent the Yellow River changing its course—a task even greater than constructing the Great Wall, and that he formed dams and opened irrigating channels.",
    "It may be that he did much work in reclaiming land and regulating the government of the Empire.",
    "But there can be little doubt that the traditions surviving from his age were mixed with the older traditions regarding the Babylonian flood.",
    "Yu is no mere canal cutter.",
    "He hews the rocks and forms chasms between the mountains, like Pʼan Ku, the Chinese Ptah or Indra, he constructs the embankments of lakes, and makes channels for the great rivers, and he drains the marshes.",
    "The grounds are made habitable and fit for cultivation.",
    "There are even faint echoes of the Osirian legend in the stories regarding his achievements.",
    "After Yu had finished his work, Heaven presented him with a dark-coloured mace.",
    "[446] He was destined to become Emperor of the nine provinces, we are told, but it is doubtful if the Empire was really so large during his reign.",
    "After Shun resigned, Yu ascended the throne.",
    "The vegetation then became luxuriant, and green dragons lay on the borders of the Empire.",
    "Yellow dragons rose from the rivers when Yu crossed them.",
    "His reign lasted for forty-five years.",
    "The sixth Emperor of the Hea Dynasty was another famous man.",
    "This was Shao-Kʼang.",
    "His father had been murdered, and his mother took flight and concealed herself.",
    "She gave birth to her son during her reign in Shan-tung, when he became a herdsman.",
    "Like Horus, he was searched for by the monarch who had usurped the throne, and he had to take to flight and become a cook.",
    "In time he was able to collect an army and win a great victory, which enabled him to regain the throne of his father.",
    "The last few Emperors of the Dynasty of Hea were weak and licentious men.",
    "It is told of Kʼung-Kea, the fourteenth of his line, that he was the cause of much misfortune, and caused the government to decay.",
    "Among the terrible things he did was to eat a female dragon which had been slain and pickled for him.",
    "Kwei, the seventeenth Emperor, was the first to introduce men-drawn carriages, but the omens of his reign foretold the approaching doom of the dynasty; the five planets wandered from their courses, and stars fell like rain in his tenth year.",
    "He was overthrown by Tʼang, the founder of the Dynasty of Shang.",
    "Tʼang had seven names, one of which was Li.",
    "He was descended from the Empress Keen-tieh, who, having prayed for a son, entered a river to bathe.",
    "A dark swallow came nigh and dropped a variegated egg from her mouth, which the Empress swallowed.",
    "She became pregnant, and gave birth to a son named See, who, when he grew up, was appointed by Yao, Minister of Instruction, and was given the principality of Shang.",
    "Thirteen generations later the wife of one of See’s descendants gave birth to Tʼang, the future Emperor.",
    "She had become pregnant after seeing a white vapour passing through the moon.",
    "The child had whiskers at birth, and his arms had four joints.",
    "He grew to the height of nine cubits.",
    "Wonderful things happened to prove that Tʼang was the chosen by Heaven to reign over the Empire.",
    "When he visited the altar of Yao, he dropped a jewel into the water.",
    "“Lo! yellow fishes leapt up in pairs; a blackbird followed him, and stood on the altar, where it changed into a black gem.”",
    "There also appeared a black tortoise, which had on its back characters intimating that Tʼang was to become the Emperor.",
    "A spirit appeared on Mount Pei at the same time.",
    "“Another spirit, dragging a white wolf, with a hook in his mouth, entered the court of Shang.",
    "The virtue of metal waxed powerful; silver overflowed from the hills.”",
    "Tʼang himself dreamed that “he went to the sky and licked it.",
    "After this he became possessor of the Empire.”",
    "[447] When the Dynasty of Shang began to decline, the rulers became weak and profligate.",
    "It is told of Wu-Yih, who reigned for only four years (1198–1194 B.C.), he was “without any right principle.",
    "He made an image of a man, and called it ‘the Spirit of Heaven’.",
    "Then he ‘gamed with it’ (played dice, or at chess), causing someone to play for the image.",
    "‘The Spirit of Heaven’ was unsuccessful, on which he disgraced it, and made a leather bag, which he filled with blood, and then placed aloft and shot at (the image was probably in the bag as well), calling this ‘shooting at Heaven’....",
    "In the fourth year of his reign, while hunting between the Ho and the Wei, Wu-Yih suddenly died.",
    "Tsʼeen says that he was struck dead by lightning; and people recognize in that event the just and appropriate vengeance of Heaven which he had insulted.”",
    "[448] The Kafirs of Africa “play at a game of chance before their idols, and, should chance be against them, kick and box their idols; but if, after this correction, on pursuing their experiments they should continue unsuccessful, they burn the hands and feet off them in the fire; should ill fortune still attend them, they cast the idols on the ground, tread them under foot, dash them about with such force as to break them to pieces.",
    "Some, indeed, who show greater veneration for the images, content themselves with fettering and binding them until they have obtained their end; but should this not take place as early as their impatience looks for, they fasten them to a cord and gradually let them down into the water, even to the bottom, thus trusting to force them to be propitious”.",
    "[449] It may be that Wu-Yih (Wuh-I) was engaged in some such ceremony when he disgraced and tortured his god.",
    "A successor is remembered as the first man who used ivory chop-sticks.",
    "The Viscount of Ke admonished him, saying: “Ivory chop-sticks will be followed by cups of gem; and then you will be wanting to eat bears’ paws and leopards’ wombs, and proceed to other extravagances.",
    "Your indulgence of your desires may cost you the Empire.”",
    "This was Chou-sin, an intemperate and extravagant tyrant.",
    "He came under the influence of a beautiful but wicked woman, called Ta-ke, whom he married.",
    "“The most licentious songs were composed for her amusement and the vilest dances exhibited.”",
    "A park was laid out for her amusement.",
    "“There was a pond of wine; the trees were hung with flesh; men and women chased each other about quite naked.”",
    "Drinking bouts were common in the palace, and when the princes began to rebel, new and terrible tortures were introduced.",
    "The queen had constructed a copper pillar, which was greased all over.",
    "It was laid above a charcoal fire, and culprits were ordered to walk on it.",
    "When they slipped and fell into the fire, Ta-ke was “greatly delighted”.",
    "The Dynasty of Shang was overthrown by King Wu, the founder of the Dynasty of Chou.",
    "Wu was descended from the famous lady Kian Yuan, already referred to (see Index).",
    "After treading in the toe-print (or foot-print) made by God, she gave birth to her son, Hau Ki, suffering no pain.",
    "Like Gilgamesh, Sargon, Romulus and Remus, Karna, and other famous heroes, the child was exposed after birth, the lady’s husband, according to one Chinese commentator, having been displeased with what had taken place.",
    "In the Shih King the ode, which relates the legend of Hau Ki, says: He was placed in a narrow lane, But the sheep and oxen protected him with loving care.",
    "He was placed in a wide forest, Where he was met by the wood-cutters.",
    "He was placed on the cold ice, And a bird screened and supported him with its wings.",
    "When the bird went away, Hau Ki began to wail.",
    "His cry was long and loud, So that his voice filled the whole way.",
    "[450] The ode goes on to tell that when Hau Ki grew up he promoted husbandry and founded the sacrifices of his house.",
    "Some of the Osirian-Tammuz traditions were attached to his memory, but, as Legge says, “he has not displaced the older Shan-nung, with whom, on his father’s side, he had a connection as ‘the Father of Husbandry’”.",
    "[451] Before Wu became Emperor, a red man came out of the river to secure the support of allies, and phœnixes brought messages to the effect that the reigning dynasty was doomed.",
    "The empire could not be enjoyed by the Shang King; “the powerful spirits of the earth have left it; all the spirits are whisked away; the conjunction of the five planets in Fang brightens all within the four seas”.",
    "[452] King Wen, the father of Wu, to whom this revelation had been made, was a ruler in the west, and knew that his son’s mission in life was the regeneration of the empire.",

    "[453] After Wu became the Emperor the worship of ancestors was promoted, and dragons, tortoises, and phœnixes made regular appearances, while vegetation flourished, and the mugwort grew so plentifully that a palace could be erected from it.",

    "The Crown Prince was still a minor, and for seven years the Duke of Chou acted as regent.",
    "Accompanied by the young king the duke visited the Ho and the Lo.",
    "The king dropped a gem into the water, and after day declined “rays of glory came out and shrouded all the Ho (Yellow River), and green clouds came floating in the sky.",
    "A green dragon came to the altar, and went away.",
    "They did the same at the Lo, and the same thing happened.”",
    "A tortoise appeared, and on its shell were writings that told of the fortunes of the empire till the dynasties of Tsʼin and Han.",
    "[454] The tortoise-shell and stalks of a variety of grass were long used in China for purposes of divination.",
    "What the tortoise and the grass revealed was supposed to be the will of the spirits.",
    "Nowadays lots are drawn, spirit-writing is believed in, and revelations are supposed to be made when a bean symbol is tossed in the air, as is a coin in the West; when the flat side is uppermost the tosser is supposed to receive a refusal to his prayer.",
    "The Chou Dynasty was founded, according to Chinese dating, in 1122 B.C., and lasted until 249 B.C.",
    "It has been suggested that although the Chous claimed to be descended from one of Shun’s ministers, they were really foreigners partly or wholly of Tartar origin.",
    "King Wu introduced the sacrifice of human beings to the spirits of ancestors, and favoured the magicians, whom he appointed to high positions in his court.",

    "After holding sway for about eight hundred years, the Chou Dynasty, and with it the Feudal Age, came to an end.",
    "The State of Chin or Tsʼin, which had been absorbing rival states, became so powerful that, in 221 B.C., its king, Shih-huang-ti, became the first Emperor of China.",
    "He resolved that the future history of China should begin with himself, and issued a decree commanding that all existing literature should be burned, except medical and agricultural books, and those dealing with divination.",
    "Those who disobeyed his order and attempted to conceal the forbidden books were put to death.",
    "Fortunately, however, some devoted scholars succeeded in preserving for posterity a number of the classics which would otherwise have perished.",
    "This extraordinary decree has cast a shadow over the fame of the first emperor, who was undoubtedly a great man.",
    "During the early years of the Chin or Tsʼin Dynasty the Great Wall to the west and north of China was constructed, so as to protect the empire against the barbarians who were wont to raid and pillage the rich pastoral and agricultural lands, and impose their sway on the industrious Chinese.",
    "“The building of the Great Wall”, says Kropotkin, “was an event fraught with the greatest consequences, and one may say without exaggeration that it contributed powerfully to the premature downfall of the Roman Empire.”",
    "The Mongolian and Turki peoples who had been attempting to subdue China were forced westward, and tribal and racial movements were set in motion that ultimately led to the invasions of Europe by nomadic fighting pastoralists from Asia.",
    "[455] The Great Wall is said to have been built in ten years in a straight line of about 1200 miles, the average width at the base being 25 feet, and the average height 30 feet.",
    "Strong “block-house” towers were constructed in the wall for the accommodation of bodies of troops.",

    "Hunting and pastoral peoples adopted the agricultural mode of life, and with it the elements of a complex civilization which had its origin in those areas where grew wild the cereals first cultivated by man.",
    "The Chinese are a mixed race.",
    "In the north the oblique-eyed, yellow-skinned element predominates.",
    "Like the Semites, who overran Sumeria and adopted Sumerian modes of thought and life, so did the Mongoloid tribes overrun northern China and became a sedentary people.",
    "Petty kingdoms grew up, and in time found it necessary to unite against the hordes who invaded and plundered their lands.",
    "The invaders included Siberian nomads, Manchus, Mongolo-Turki peoples, the Sacæ (western Scythians), and the blue-eyed Usuns or Wusuns who are believed to have been congeners of the kurgan-builders of southern Siberia and southern Russia.",
    "It was against Manchus and Mongols that the Great Wall was erected, after northern China had been united as a result of those conquests which made petty kings over-lords of ever-widening areas.",
    "During the Han Dynasty southern China was subdued.",
    "There the brownish-skinned Man-tze stock is most in prominence.",
    "Ancient Indonesian intrusions have left their impress on the racial blend.",
    "Along the sea-coasts of China the sea-traders exercised their influence, and in time their mode of life was adopted by the conquerors from the inland parts of the growing empire.",
    "The types of vessels used by the ancient Egyptians, the Phœnicians, the peoples of the Persian Gulf, the Indians, Burmese, Indonesians, and Polynesians became common on the Chinese coast and rivers.",
    "Maritime enterprise was stimulated, as we have seen, by the Far Eastern Columbuses who searched for the elixir of life and the fabled “Islands of the Blest”.",
    "“The Chinese,” writes Mr. Kebel Chatterton, “in their own independent way went on developing from the early Egyptian models (of ships), and have been not inaptly called the Dutchmen of the east in their nautical tendencies.”",
    "[456] It is believed that they were the inventors of the rudder, which took the place of the ancient steering-oar.",
    "Along their coastal sea-routes the Chinese were brought into touch with southern peoples, with whom they traded.",
    "Chinese records throw light on the articles that were in demand at markets.",
    "“In Nan-čao”, [457] an ancient text reveals, “there are people from Pʼo-lo-men (Burma), Pose (Malay), Še-po (Java), Pʼo-ni (Borneo), Kʼun-lun (a Malayan country), and of many other heretic tribes, meeting at one trading-mart, where pearls and precious stones in great number are exchanged for gold and musk.”",
    "[458] The early traders by sea and land attached great importance to medicines and elixirs, and precious stones and metals, and pearls.",
    "The overland trade-routes through Iran brought the Chinese into direct touch with Lesser Fu-lin (Syria), and ultimately with Greater Fu-lin (the Byzantine Empire).",
    "The vine and other plants with ancient religious associations were imported into China, and the Chinese peach tree reached Europe.",
    "With the peach went silk.",
    "“It is not impossible,” says Laufer, “that these two gifts were transmitted by the silk-dealers, first to Iran (in the second or first century B.C.), and thence to Armenia, Greece, and Rome (in the first century A.D.).”",
    "[459] As the cuckoos hatched in the nests of hedge-sparrows, meadow-pipits, and wagtails overcome and eject the offspring of their foster-parents, so did the vigorous nomadic peoples who absorbed the elements of ancient civilizations overcome and eject the offspring of their “foster-parents”.",
    "The Babylonian Empire perished, and Irania, which had been stimulated by it to adopt civilized conditions of life, became, in turn, the nursery of vigorous states.",
    "Recent discoveries have brought to light evidence which shows that the Iranian peoples “once covered an immense territory, extending all over Chinese Turkestan, migrating into China, coming into contact with the Chinese, and exerting a profound influence on nations of other stock, notably Turks and Chinese.",
    "The Iranians were the great mediators between the West and the East, conveying the heritage of Hellenistic ideas to central and eastern Asia, and transmitting valuable plants and goods of China to the Mediterranean area.”",
    "[460] The laws of supply and demand operated then as now on the trade-routes, which brought communities of regular traders into touch after they had cultivated plants or manufactured articles to offer in exchange for what they received.",
    "Before these routes could, however, have hummed with commerce, a considerable advance in civilization had to be achieved.",
    "States had to be organized and laws enforced for the protection of property and property owners.",
    "The Iranians, who obtained silk from China, were not the originators of the culture represented by this commodity; they simply stimulated the demand for silk.",
    "Chinese civilization dates back to the time when the early prospectors and explorers came into touch with backward peoples, and introduced new modes and conditions of life.",
    "These pioneers did not necessarily move along the routes that were ultimately favoured by merchants, nor even those followed by migrating tribes in quest of green pastures.",
    "They wandered hither and thither searching for gold and gems and herbs, sowing as they went the seeds of civilization, which did not, however, always fall on good ground.",
    "But in those places where the seed took root and the prospects of development were favourable, organized communities gradually grew up with an assured food-supply.",
    "This was the case in Shensi province, in which was settled the “little leaven” that ultimately “leavened the whole lump” of northern China.",
    "It was after the empire became united under the Tsʼin Dynasty that organized trade with the west assumed great dimensions, and was regularly maintained under assured protection.",
    "Myths as well as herbs and gems and garments were exchanged by traders.",
    "With the glittering jewel was carried the religious lore associated with it; with the curative herb went many a fable of antiquity.",
    "Laufer has shown in his The Diamond how Hellenistic lore connected with that gem crept into Chinese writings.",
    "It is consequently possible to trace in the mosaic of Chinese beliefs and mythology certain of the cultural elements that met and blended and were developed on the banks of the Yellow River.",
    "Elixirs and charms were in great demand in all centres of ancient civilizations.",
    "It can be held, therefore, that behind the commerce of early times, as behind the early religious systems, lay the haunting dread of death.",
    "Gems warded off evil, and imparted vitality to those who possessed them, and curative herbs renewed youth by restoring health.",
    "Even the dead were benefited by them.",
    "Progress was thus, in a sense, increasing efficiency in the quest of longevity in this world and the next.",
    "In China, as elsewhere, the dread of death, as expressed in the religious system, promoted the arts and crafts; artists, engravers, architects, builders, jewellers, and scribes, as well as priests and traders, were engaged in the unceasing conflict against the all-dreaded enemy of mankind, the God of Death.",
    "The incentive that caused men to undertake perilous journeys by land and sea in quest of elixirs, to live laborious lives in workshops and temples, and to grasp at the mythical straws of hope drifted along trade-routes from other lands, was the same as that which sent the Babylonian Gilgamesh to explore the dark tunnel of the Mountain of Mashu and cross the Sea of Death, and it is found on the ninth tablet of the most ancient epic in the world:",
    "Gilgamesh wept bitterly, and he lay stretched out upon the ground.",
    "He cried: “Let me not die like Ea-bani!",
    "Grief hath entered into my body, and I fear death....”",

    "There are three religions in China, or, as native scholars put it, “three Teachings”, namely Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism.",
    "Pure Taoism, as taught by Lao Tze, is, like the Buddhism of its founder, Siddhartha Gautama, metaphysical and mystical.",
    "It is similarly based on a vague and somewhat bewildering conception of the origin of life and the universe; it recognizes a creative and directing force which, at the beginning, caused Everything to come out of Nothing.",
    "This force, when in action, is called the Tao.",
    "It is so called from the time when it began to move, to create, to cause Unity to be.",
    "The Tao existed before then, but it was nameless, and utterly incomprehensible.",
    "It existed, some writers say, even when there was nothing.",
    "Others go the length of asserting that it existed before there was nothing.",
    "We can understand what is meant by “nothing”, but we cannot understand what the Nameless was before it was manifested as the Tao.",
    "The Tao is not God; it is impersonal.",
    "Taoists must make unquestioning submission to the Tao, which must be allowed to have absolute sway in the individual, in society, in the world at large.",
    "Taoism does not, like Buddhism, yearn for extinction, dissolution, or ultimate loss of identity and consciousness in the nebulous Nirvana.",
    "Nor does it, like Buddhism, teach that life is not worth living—that it is sorrowful to be doomed to be reborn.",
    "Rather, it conceives of a perfect state of existence in this world, and of prolonged longevity in the next.",
    "All human beings can live happily if they become like little children, obeying the law (Tao) as a matter of course, following in “the way” (Tao) without endeavouring to understand, or having any desire to understand, what the Tao is.",
    "The obedient, unquestioning state of mind is reached by means of Inaction—mental Inaction.",
    "The Tao drifts the meritorious individual towards perfection, out of darkness into light.",
    "Those who submit to the Tao know nothing of ethical ideals; they are in no need of definite beliefs.",
    "It is unnecessary to teach virtue when all are virtuous; it is unnecessary to have rites and ceremonies when all are perfect; it is unnecessary to be concerned about evil when evil ceases to exist.",
    "The same idea prevailed among the Brahmanic sages of India, whose Krita or Perfect Age was without gods or devils.",
    "Being perfect, the people required no religion.",
    "Confucianism is not concerned with metaphysical abstractions, or with that sense of the Unity of all things and all beings in the One, which is summed up in the term “Mysticism”.",
    "It maintains a somewhat agnostic, but not irreligious frame of mind, confessing inability to deal with the spirit world, or to understand, or theorize about, its mysteries.",
    "It recognizes the existence of God and of spirits.",
    "“Respect the spirits,” said Confucius, “but keep them at a distance....”",
    "He also said: “Wisdom has been imparted to me.",
    "If God were to destroy this wisdom (his system of ethics) the generations to come could not inherit it.”",
    "Whether or not Confucius ever heard of the system of Lao Tze is uncertain.",
    "If he did, it certainly made no appeal to him.",
    "His own system of instruction was intensely practical.",
    "It was concerned mainly with ethical and political ideals—with political morality.",
    "He was no believer in Inaction.",
    "The salvation of mankind, according to his system, could be achieved by strict adherence to the ideals of right living and right thinking, and a robust and vigorous application of them in the everyday life of individuals and the State.",
    "The reputed founder or earliest teacher of Taoism was Lao Tze, about whom little or nothing is known.",
    "He is believed to have been born in 604 B.C., and to have died soon after 532 B.C. Confucius was born in 551 B.C., and died in 479 B.C. There are Chinese traditions that the two sages met on at least one occasion, but these are not credited by Western or modern native Chinese scholars.",
    "Confucius makes no direct reference to Lao Tze in his writings.",
    "Lao Tze",
    "[462] means “Old Boy”, as Osiris, in his Libyan form, is said to mean the “Old Man”.",
    "[463] He was given this name by his followers, because “his mother carried him in her womb for seventy-two years, so that when he was at length cut out of it his hair was already white”.",
    "Julius Cæsar was reputed to have been born in like manner; so was the Gaelic hero, Goll MacMorna, who, as we gather from Dunbar, was known in the Lowlands as well as the Highlands; the poet makes one of his characters exclaim, My fader, meikle Gow mas Mac Morn, Out of his moderis (mother’s) wame was shorn.",
    "The same legend clings to the memory of Thomas the Rhymer, who is referred to in Gaelic as “the son of the dead woman” (mac na mna marbh), because his mother died before the operation was performed.",
    "Shakespeare’s Macduff “was from his mother’s womb untimely ripped”.",
    "[464] It may be that this widespread birth-story had its origin in Egypt.",
    "Plutarch, in his treatise on the Mystery of Osiris and Isis, tells that Set (the ancient god who became a devil) was “born neither at the proper time, nor by the right place”, but that he “forced his way through a wound which he had made in his mother’s side”.",
    "Different forms of the legend are found in China.",
    "According to the traditions preserved in the “Bamboo Books”, which are of uncertain antiquity, the Emperor Yao was born fourteen months after he was conceived, the Emperor Yu emerged from his mother’s back, and the Emperor Yin from his mother’s chest.",
    "The Aryo-Indian hero, Karna, a prominent figure in the Mahábhárata, emerged from one of his mother’s ears; he was a son of Surya, the sun-god.",
    "According to Taoist lore (after Buddhism and Taoism were partly fused in China), Lao Tze appeared from time to time in China during the early dynasties in different forms, and with different names.",
    "He had the personal knowledge of the decline of the influence of the Tao from the Perfect Age.",
    "After Fu-hi and other sovereigns disturbed the harmonies of heaven and earth, “the manners of the people, from being good and simple, became bad and mean”.",
    "He came to cleanse the stream of spiritual life at its source, and was ultimately reborn as Lao Tze, under the Plum Tree of Longevity, having been conceived under the influence of a star in the constellation of the Great Bear.",
    "Li (plum tree) was his surname.",
    "Lao Tze is said to have held a position in the Royal Library of Kau.",
    "When he perceived that the State showed signs of decadence, he resolved to leave the world, like the Indian heroes, Yudhishthira and his brothers.",
    "He went westwards, apparently believing, as did Confucius, “that the Most Holy was to be found in the West”.",
    "On entering the pass of Hsien-Ku (in modern Ling-pao, Ho-nan province) the Warden, Yin Hsi, a Taoist, welcomed the sage and set before him a dish of tea.",
    "Lao Tze sat down to drink tea with his friend.",
    "This was the beginning of the tea-drinking custom between host and guest in China.",
    "[465] Said the Warden, “And so you are going into retirement.",
    "I pray you to write me a book before you leave.”",
    "Lao Tze consented, and composed the Tao Teh King, [466] which is divided into two parts, and contains over 5000 words.",
    "When he had finished writing, he gave the manuscript to the Warden, bade him farewell, and went on his way.",
    "It is not known where he died.",
    "The most prominent of Lao Tze’s disciples was Kwang Tze, who lived in the fourth century B.C. Sze-ma Khien, the earliest Chinese historian of note, who died about 85 B.C., says that Kwang Tze wrote “with purpose to calumniate the system of Confucius and exalt the mysteries of Lao Tze”.",
    "But although he wrote much, “no one could give practical application to his teaching”.",
    "Other famous Taoist writers were Han Fei Tze, who committed suicide in 233 B.C., and Liu An, prince of Hwai-nan, and grandson of the founder of the Han Dynasty, who took his own life in 122 B.C., having become involved in a treasonable plot.",
    "Another form of the legend is that this prince discovered the Water of Life.",
    "As soon as he drank of it, his body became so light that he ascended to the Celestial Regions in broad daylight and was seen by many.",
    "As he rose he let fall the cup from which he had drunk.",
    "His dogs lapped up the water and followed him.",
    "Then his poultry drank from the cup and likewise rose in the air and vanished from sight.",
    "Apparently it was not only the poor Indians “with untutored minds” who thought their dogs (not to speak of their hens) would be admitted to the “equal sky”, there to bear them company.",
    "It is generally believed by Oriental scholars that both Taoism and Confucianism are of greater antiquity than their reputed founders.",
    "Confucius insisted that he was “a transmitter, not a maker”, and Lao Tze is found to refer to “an ancient”, “a sage”, and “a writer on war”, as if he had been acquainted with writings that have not come down to us.",
    "There is internal evidence in the Taoistic texts of Lao Tze and Kwang Tze that the idea of the Tao had an intimate association in early times with the ancient Cult of the West—the cult of the mother-goddess who had her origin in water.",
    "The priestly theorists instructed the worshippers of the Great Mother that at the beginning she came into existence as an egg, or a lotus bloom from which rose the Creator, the sun-god, or that she was a Pot containing water from which all things have come—the pot being the inexhaustible womb of Nature, and the symbol of the Great Mother-goddess.",
    "But they themselves were not satisfied with this myth.",
    "They recognized that there was at work at the beginning a force—a law which “opened the way”, a phrase which may have had a physical significance but ultimately became a mystical one.",
    "In Chinese Taoism, this force is the Tao which is manifested in order, stability, and rightness; it is Truth.",
    "The Ancient Egyptian philosophers believed, at as remote a time as the Pyramid Texts period (c. 2500 B.C.), that everything had origin in Mind.",
    "The Universe was the idea of Ptah, the “opener”; he conceived it in his “Heart” (Mind); when he expressed the idea, the Universe came into existence.",
    "Ptah, the great, is the mind and tongue of the gods....",
    "It (the mind) is the one that bringeth forth every successful issue.",
    "It is the tongue which repeats the thought of the mind: It (the mind) was the fashioner of all gods...",
    "At a time when every divine word Came into existence by the thought of the mind, And the command of the tongue.",
    "[467] Although Breasted first thought that this fragment was a survival from the Empire period (c. 1500 B.C.), he has since become convinced, like Erman, that it must, on the basis of orthography, be relegated to the Pyramid Age.",
    "“Is there not here,” Breasted asks, “the primeval germ of the later Alexandrian doctrine of the ‘Logos’?”",
    "[468] In India Brahma (neuter) was the World Soul, “that subtle essence” which, according to the composers of the Upanishads, exists in everything that is, but cannot be seen.",
    "The personal Brahma, as Prajapati, arose, at the beginning, from this impersonal World Soul.",
    "“Mind (or Soul, manas),” an Indian sage has declared, “was created from the non-existent.",
    "Mind created Prajapati.",
    "Prajapati created offspring.",
    "All this, whatever exists, rests absolutely on mind.”",
    "Another Indian sage writes: “At first the Universe was not anything.",
    "There was neither sky, nor earth, nor air.",
    "Being non-existent, it resolved, ‘Let me be.’",
    "It became fervent.",
    "From that fervour smoke was produced.",
    "It again became fervent.",
    "From the fervour fire was produced.",
    "Afterwards the fire became ‘rays’",
    "[469] and the ‘rays’ condensed into a cloud, producing the sea.",
    "A magical formula (Dasahotri) was created.",
    "Prajapati is the Dasahotri.”",
    "When the Rev. Dr. Chalmers of Canton translated the Taoist Texts into English in 1868 [470], he wrote: “I have thought it better to leave the word ‘Tao’ untranslated, both because it has given the name to the sect—the Taoists—and because no English word is its exact equivalent.",
    "Three terms suggest themselves—‘the Way’, ‘Reason’, and ‘the Word’; but they are all liable to objection.",
    "Were we guided by etymology, ‘the Way’ would come nearest to the original, and in one or two passages the idea of a Way seems to be in the term; but this is too materialistic to serve the purpose of a translation.",
    "‘Reason’ again seems to be more like a quality or attribute of some conscious Being than Tao is.",
    "I would translate it by ‘the Word’ in the sense of the Logos, but this would be like settling the question which I wish to leave open, viz.",
    "what amount of resemblance there is between the Logos of the New Testament and this Tao, which is its nearest representative in Chinese.”",
    "The New Testament doctrine of the Logos may here be reproduced by way of comparison, the quotation being from Dr. Weymouth’s idiomatic translation, which may be compared with the authorized versions: [471] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.",
    "He was in the beginning with God.",
    "All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing that exists came into being.",
    "In Him was Life, and that Life was the Light of men.",
    "The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overpowered it.",
    "There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.",
    "He came as a witness, in order that he might give testimony concerning the Light—so that all might believe through him.",
    "He was not the Light, but he existed that he might give testimony concerning the Light.",
    "The true Light was that which illumines every man by its coming into the world.",
    "He was in the world, and the world came into existence through Him, and the world did not recognize Him.",
    "The meaning of the word “Tao”, says Max Von Brandt, “has never been explained or understood,” and he adds, “Like the Hellenistic ‘Logos’, it is at once the efficient and the material cause.”",
    "[472] Professor G. Foot Moore says, “Tao is literally ‘way’; like corresponding words in many languages, ‘course’, ‘method’, ‘order’, ‘norm’.”",
    "[473] Archdeacon Hardwick",
    "[474] was “disposed to argue” that the system of Taoism was founded on the idea of “some power resembling the ‘Nature’ of modern speculators.",
    "The indefinite expression ‘Tao’ was adopted to denominate an abstract cause, or the initial principle of life and order, to which worshippers were able to assign the attributes of immateriality, eternity, immensity, invisibility.”",
    "Canon Farrar has written in this connection: “We have long personified under the name of Nature the sum total of God’s law as observed in the physical world; and now the notion of Nature as a distinct, living, independent entity seems to be ineradicable alike from our literature and our systems of philosophy.”",
    "[475] Dr. Legge comments on this passage: “But it seems to me that this metaphorical use of the word ‘nature’ for the Cause and Ruler of it implies the previous notion of Him, that is, of God, in the mind.”",
    "[476] Dr. Legge notes that in Lao Tze’s treatise “Tao appears as the spontaneously operating cause of all movement in the phenomena of the universe....",
    "Tao is a phenomenon, not a positive being, but a mode of being.”",
    "[477] Others have rendered Tao as “God”.",
    "But “the old Taoists had no idea of a personal God,” says Dr. Legge.",
    "De Groot",
    "[478] refers to Tao as “the ‘Path’, the unalterable course of Nature,” and adds that the “reverential awe of the mysterious influences of Nature is the fundamental principle of an ancient religious system usually styled by foreigners Tao-ism.”",
    "The idea of the Chinese Tao resembles somewhat that of the Indian Brahma (neuter).",
    "Lao Tze says: “It (Tao) was undetermined and perfected, existing before the heaven and the earth.",
    "Peaceful was it and incomprehensible, alone and unchangeable, filling everything, the inexhaustible mother of all things.",
    "I know not its name, and therefore I call it Tao.",
    "I seek after its name and I call it the Great.",
    "In greatness it flows on for ever, it retires and returns.",
    "Therefore is the Tao great.”",
    "In his chapter “The Manifestation of the Mystery”, Lao Tze says: “We look at it (Tao), and we do not see it, and we name it ‘the Equable’.",
    "“We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it ‘the Inaudible’.",
    "“We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it ‘the Subtle’.",
    "“With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain ‘The One’.”",
    "Some scholars, like Joseph Edkins and Victor von Strauss, have contended that Lao Tze was attempting to express the ideas of Jehovah in Hebrew theology.",
    "Others incline to the belief that the influence of Indian Brahmanic speculations had reached China at an early period and inaugurated the intuitional teaching found in Lao Tze’s treatise.",
    "The idea of the first cause had arisen in India before the close of the Vedic Age.",
    "At the beginning: There was neither existence nor non-existence, The Kingdom of air, nor the sky beyond.",
    "What was there to contain, to cover, in— Was it but vast, unfathomed depths of water?",
    "There was no death there, nor Immortality:",
    "No sun was there, dividing day from night.",
    "Then was there only THAT, resting within itself.",
    "Apart from it, there was not anything.",
    "At first within the darkness veiled in darkness, Chaos unknowable, the All lay hid.",
    "Till straitway from the formless void made manifest By the great power of heat was born the germ.",
    "[479] The Great Unknown was by the later Vedic poets referred to by the interrogative pronoun “What?”",
    "(Ka).",
    "In the Indian Khandogya Upanishad, the sage tells a pupil to break open a fruit.",
    "He then asks, “What do you see?”",
    "and receiving the reply, “Nothing”, says, “that subtle essence which you do not perceive there, of that very essence this great Nyagrodha tree exists.",
    "Believe me, my son, that which is the subtle essence, in it all that exists has itself.",
    "It is the True.",
    "It is self; and thou, my son, art it.”",
    "[480] The idea of the oneness and unity of all things is the basic principle of mysticism.",
    "There is true knowledge.",
    "Learn thou it is this: To see one changeless Life in all the lives, And in the Separate, One Inseparable.",
    "[481] Dr. Legge in his commentary on The Texts of Taoism, asks his readers to mark well the following predicates of the Tao: “Before there were heaven and earth, from of old, there It was securely existing.",
    "From It came the mysterious existence of spirits; from It the mysterious existence of Ti (God).",
    "It produced heaven.",
    "It produced earth.”",
    "[482] Lao Tze had probably never been in India, but that passage from his writings might well have been composed by one of the Brahmanic sages who composed the Upanishads.",
    "The explanation may be that in Brahmanism and Taoism we have traces of the influence of Babylonian and Egyptian schools of thought.",
    "No direct proof is available in this connection.",
    "It is possible, however, that the ancient sages who gave oral instruction to their pupils were the earliest missionaries on the trade-routes.",
    "The search for wealth had, as has been shown, a religious incentive.",
    "It is unlikely, therefore, that only miners and traders visited distant lands in which precious metals and jewels were discovered.",
    "Expeditions, such as those of the Egyptian rulers that went to Punt for articles required in the temples, were essentially religious expeditions.",
    "It was in the temples that the demand for gold and jewels was stimulated, and each temple had its workshops with their trade secrets.",
    "The priests of Egypt were the dyers, and they were the earliest alchemists [483] of whom we have knowledge.",
    "Such recipes as are found recorded in the Leyden papyrus were no doubt kept from the common people.",
    "Associated with the search for metals was the immemorial quest of the elixir of life, which was undoubtedly a priestly business—one that required the performance of religious ceremonies of an elaborate character.",
    "Metals and jewels, as we have seen, as well as plants, contained the “soul substance” that was required to promote health and to ensure longevity in this world and in the next.",
    "It was, no doubt, the priestly prospectors, and not the traders and working miners, who first imparted to jade its religious value as a substitute for gold and jewels.",
    "When the searchers for wealth introduced into India and China the god Ptah’s potter’s wheel they may well have introduced too the doctrine of the Logos, found in the pyramid-age Ptah hymn quoted above, in which the World Soul is the “mind” of the god, and the active principle “the tongue” that utters “the Word”.",
    "If they did so—the hypothesis does not seem to be improbable—it may be that as Buddhism was in India mixed with Naga worship, and was imported into Tibet and China as a fusion of metaphysical speculations and crude idolatrous beliefs and practices, the priestly philosophies of Egypt and Babylonia were similarly associated with the debris of primitive ideas and ceremonies when they reached distant lands.",
    "As a matter of fact, it is found that in both these culture centres this fusion was maintained all through their histories.",
    "Ptah might be the “Word” to the priests, but to the common people he remained the artisan-god for thousands of years—the god who hammered out the heavens and set the world in order—a form of Shu who separated the heavens from the earth, as did Pʼan Ku in China.",
    "In India and China, as in ancient Egypt, the doctrine of the Logos, in its earliest and vaguest form, was associated with the older doctrine that life and the universe emerged at the beginning from the womb of the mother-goddess, who was the active principle in water, or the personification of that principle.",
    "In one of the several Indian creation myths, Prajapati emerges, like the Egyptian Sun-god Horus, from the lotus-bloom floating on the primordial waters.",
    "The lotus is the flower form of the Great Mother, who in Egypt is Hathor.",
    "Another myth tells that after the heat caused the rays to arise, and the rays caused a cloud to form, and the cloud became water, the Self-Existent Being (here the Great Father) created a seed.",
    "He flung the seed into the waters, and it became a golden egg.",
    "From the egg came forth the personal Brahma (Prajapati).",
    "[484] Because Brahma came from the waters (Narah), and they were his first home or path (ayana), he is called Narayana.",
    "[485] Here we have the “path” or “way”, the Chinese Tao in one of its phases.",
    "When the Tao (neuter) became “active”, it did not manifest itself as a Great Father, however, but as a Great Mother.",
    "The passive Tao is nameless; the active Tao has a name.",
    "Lao Tze’s great treatise, The Tao Teh King, opens: “The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao.",
    "The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name, (Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth; (Conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all things.”",
    "[486] The creation myths embedded in the writings of Lao Tze are exceedingly vague.",
    "“The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things.",
    "All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonized by the Breath of Vacancy.”",
    "[487] Another passage seems to indicate that the One, first produced, was the Mother, and that the two produced by her were Heaven and Earth—the god of the sky and the goddess of the earth: “Heaven and Earth (under the guidance of Tao) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without the direction of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord.”",
    "[488] The fertilizing dew, like the creative tears of Egyptian and Indian deities, gave origin to earth and its plants, and to all living things.",
    "But no such details are given by Lao Tze.",
    "He is content to suggest that the Tao as “the Honoured Ancestor” appears to have been before God.",
    "In his chapter, “The Completion of Material Forms”, he refers to the female valley spirit.",
    "“The valley,” says Legge, “is used metaphorically as a symbol of ‘emptiness’ or ‘vacancy’, and the ‘spirit of the valley’ is ‘the female mystery’—the Tao which is ‘the mother of all things’.”",
    "Chalmers renders Chapter VI as follows: “The Spirit (like perennial spring) of the Valley never dies.",
    "This (Spirit)",
    "I call the abyss-mother.",
    "The passage of the abyss-mother I call the root of heaven and earth.",
    "Ceaselessly it seems to endure, and it is employed without effort.”",
    "Dr. Legge’s rendering is in verse: The valley spirit dies not, aye the same; The female mystery thus do we name.",
    "Its gate, from which at first they issued forth, Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth.",
    "Long and unbroken does its power remain, Used gently, and without the touch of pain.",
    "[489] The symbolism of this short chapter is of special interest, and seems to throw light on the origin of the myths that were transformed by Lao Tze into philosophical abstractions.",
    "We find the “female mystery” or “abyss mother” is at once a gate (or passage) and a “root”.",
    "The Greek goddess Artemis was both.",
    "She was the guardian of the portals, and was herself the portals; she was the giver of the mugwort (the Chinese knew it), and was herself the mugwort (Artemisia), as Dr. Rendel Harris has shown.",
    "[490] She opened the gate of birth as the goddess of birth, her “key” being the mugwort, and she opened the portal of death as the goddess of death.",
    "As the goddess of riches she guarded the door of the treasure-house, and she possessed the “philosopher’s stone”, which transmuted base metals into gold.",
    "Artemis was a form of the Egyptian Hathor, Aphrodite being another specialized form.",
    "Hathor was associated with the lotus and other water plants, and was Nub, the lady of gold, who gave her name to Nubia; she was the goddess of miners, and therefore of the Sinaitic peninsula; she was the “gate” of birth and death.",
    "The monumental gateways of Egypt, India, China, and Japan appear to have been originally goddess portals.",
    "[491] The goddess of the early prospectors and miners was, as has been said, a water-goddess.",
    "In the writings of Lao Tze, his female and active Tao, “the Mother of all Things”, is closely associated with water.",
    "The chapter entitled “The Placid and Contented Nature” refers to water, and water as “an illustration of the way of the Tao, is”, Dr. Legge comments, “repeatedly employed by Lao Tze”.",
    "“The highest excellence is like (that of) water.",
    "The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things.”",
    "[492] Lao Tze, dealing with “The Attribute of Humility”, connects “water” with “women”: “What makes a great state is its being (like a low-lying down-flowing stream); it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small states) under heaven.",
    "“(To illustrate from)",
    "the case of all females:—the female always overcomes the male by her stillness.”",
    "[493] Water is soft, but it wears down the rocks.",
    "“The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice.”",
    "[494] The Tao acts like water, and (The Tao) “which originated all under the sky is”, Lao Tze says, “to be considered as the mother of all of them.",
    "When the mother is found, we know what her children should be.”",
    "[495] A passage which has puzzled commentators is, “Great, it (the Tao) passes on (in constant flow).",
    "Passing on, it becomes remote.",
    "Having become remote, it returns.",
    "Therefore the Tao is great.”",
    "[496] The reference may be to the circle of water which surrounds the world.",
    "It is possible Lao Tze had it in mind, seeing that he so often compares the action of the Tao to that of water—the Tao that produces and nourishes “by its outflowing operation”.",
    "Like “soul substance”, the Tao is found in all things that live, and in all things that exercise an influence on life.",
    "The Tao is the absolute, or, as the Brahmanic sages declared, the “It” which cannot be seen—the “It” in the fruit of the tree, the “It” in man.",
    "Lao Tze refers to the “It” as the “One”.",
    "In his chapter, “The Origin of the Law”, he writes: The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are: Heaven, which by it is bright and pure; Earth endowed thereby firm and sure; Spirits with powers by it supplied; Valleys kept full throughout their void; All creatures which through it do live; Princes and Kings who from it get The model which to all they give.",
    "[497] The Tao may produce and nourish all things and bring them to maturity, but it “exercises no control over them”.",
    "[498] Man must begin by taking control of himself: he must make use of the light that is within him.",
    "The wise man “does not dare to act” of his accord.",
    "When he has acted so that he reaches a state of inaction, the Tao will then drift him into a state of perfection.",
    "He must guard the mother (Tao) in himself by attending to the breath.",
    "“The management of the breath,” says Dr. Legge, “is the mystery of the esoteric Buddhism and Taoism.”",
    "[499] “When one knows,” Tao Tze has written, “that he is his mother’s child, and proceeds to guard (the qualities of) the mother that belongs to him, to the end of his life he will be free from peril.",
    "Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion.”",
    "[500] By giving “undivided attention to the breath” (the vital breath), and bringing it “to the utmost degree of pliancy”, he “can become as a (tender) babe.",
    "When he has cleansed away the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without a flaw.”",
    "[501] The doctrine of Inaction pervades the teaching of Lao Tze, which is quite fatalistic.",
    "Salvation depends on the individual and the state allowing the Tao to “flow” freely.",
    "“If the Empire is governed according to Tao, evil spirits will not be worshipped as good ones.",
    "“If evil spirits are not worshipped as good ones, good ones will do no injury.",
    "Neither will the Sages injure the people.",
    "Each one will not injure the other.",
    "And if neither injures the other, there will be mutual profit.”",
    "A native commentator writes in this connection: “Spirits do not hurt the natural.",
    "If people are natural, spirits have no means of manifesting themselves, and if spirits do not manifest themselves, we are not conscious of their existence as such.",
    "Likewise, if we are not conscious of the existence of spirits as such, we must be equally unconscious of the existence of inspired teachers as such; and to be unconscious of the existence of spirits and of inspired teachers is the very essence of Tao.”",
    "[502] The scholarly sage thus reached the conclusion that it is a blessed thing to know nothing, to be ignorant.",
    "Good order is necessary for the workings of the Tao, and good order is secured by abstinence from action, and by keeping the people in a state of simplicity and ignorance, so that they may be restful and child-like in their unquestioning and complete submission to the Tao.",
    "“The state of vacancy,” says Lao Tze, “should be brought to the utmost degree....",
    "When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root.",
    "This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness.”",
    "[503] There would be no virtues if there were no vices, no robberies if there were no wealth.",
    "“If,” the Taoists argued, “we would renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold.",
    "If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our rightness, the people would again become filial and kindly.",
    "If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our scheming for gain, there would be no thieves and robberies.”",
    "[504] Here we meet with the doctrine of the World’s Ages, already referred to.",
    "Men were perfect to begin with, because, as Lao Tze says, “they did not know they were ruled”.",
    "“In the age of perfect virtue,” Kwang Tze writes, “they attached no value to wisdom....",
    "They were upright and correct, without knowing that to be so was righteousness; they loved one another, without knowing that to do so was benevolence; they were honest and leal-hearted without knowing that it was loyalty; they fulfilled their engagements, without knowing that to do so was good faith; in their simple movements they employed the services of one another, without thinking that they were conferring or receiving any gift.",
    "Therefore their actions left no trace, and there was no record of their affairs.”",
    "To this state of perfection, Lao Tze wished his fellow-countrymen to return.",
    "That the idea of the Tao originated among those who went far and wide, searching for the elixir of life, is suggested by Lao Tze’s chapter, “The Value Set on Life”.",
    "He refers to those “whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death”, and asks, “For what reason?”",
    "The answer is, “Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life”.",
    "He continues: “But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp weapon.",
    "The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point.",
    "And for what reason?",
    "Because there is in him no place of death.”",
    "[505] It would appear that Lao Tze was acquainted not only with more ancient writers regarding the Tao, but with traditions regarding heroes resembling Achilles, Siegfried, and Diarmid, whose bodies had been rendered invulnerable by dragon’s blood, or the water of a river in the Otherworld; or, seeing that each of these heroes had a spot which was a “place of death”, with traditions regarding heroes who, like El Kedir, plunged in the “Well of Life” and became immortals, whose bodies could not be injured by man or beast.",
    "The El Kedirs of western Asia and Europe figure in legends as “Wandering Jews” or invulnerable heroes, including those who, like Diarmid, found the “Well of Life”, and those who had knowledge of charms that rendered them invisible or protected them against wounds.",
    "The Far Eastern stories regarding the inhabitants of the “Islands of the Blest”, related in a previous chapter, may be recalled in this connection.",
    "Having drunk the waters of the “Well of Life” and eaten of the “fungus of immortality”, they were rendered immune to poisons, and found it impossible to injure themselves.",
    "When, therefore, we find Lao Tze referring to men who had no reason to fear armed warriors or beasts of prey, it seems reasonable to conclude that these were men who had found and partaken of the elixir of life, or had accumulated “stores of vitality” by practising breathing exercises and drinking charmed water, or by acquiring “merit”, like the Indian ascetics who concentrated their thoughts on Brahma (neuter).",
    "In the chapter, “Returning to the Root”, in his Tao Teh King, Lao Tze appears to regard the Tao as a preservative against death.",
    "He who in “the state of vacancy” returns to primeval simplicity and perfectness achieves longevity through the workings of the Tao.",
    "“Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life is exempt from all danger of decay.”",
    "[506] Here the Tao acts like the magic water that restores youth.",
    "It is “soul substance”, and is required by the Chinese gods as Idun’s apples are required by the Norse gods.",
    "Says Lao Tze: “Spirits of the dead receiving It (Tao) become divine; the very gods themselves owe their divinity to its influence; and by It both heaven and earth were produced”.",
    "[507] There were floating traditions in China in Lao Tze’s time regarding men who had lived for hundreds of years.",
    "One was “the patriarch Phăng”, who is referred to by Confucius [508] as “our old Phăng”.",
    "It was told that “at the end of the Shang Dynasty (1123 B.C.) he was more than 767 years old, and still in unabated vigour”.",
    "We read that during his lifetime he lost forty-nine wives and fifty-four sons; and that, after living for about 1500 years, he died and left two sons, Wu and I, who “gave their names to the Wu-i or Bu-i Hills, from which we get our Bohea tea”.",
    "[509] Kwang Tze refers to Phăng.",
    "But instead of telling that he had discovered and partaken of the elixir of life, as he must have done in the original story, he says that he “got It (the Tao), and lived on from the time of the lord Yu to that of the five chiefs”.",
    "[510] Others who got It (the Tao) in like manner were, according to Kwang Tze, the prehistoric Shih-wei who “adjusted heaven and earth”, Fu-hsi who “by It penetrated to the mystery of the maternity of the primary matter”, the sage Hwang-Ti who “by It ascended the cloudy sky”, Fu Yueh, chief minister of Wu-ting (1324–1264 B.C.), who got It and after death mounted to the Eastern portion of the Milky Way, where, riding on Sagittarius and Scorpio, he took his place among the stars.",
    "Various spirits “imbibed” It likewise and owed their power and attributes to It (the Tao).",
    "[511] Kwang Tze tells that a man once addressed a Taoist sage, saying, “You are old, sir, while your complexion is like that of a child; how is it so?”",
    "The reply was, “I have become acquainted with the Tao”.",
    "[512] Here the Tao is undoubtedly regarded as the elixir of life—as “soul substance” that renews youth and promotes longevity.",
    "It was not, however, a thing to eat and drink—the “plant of life” or “the water of life”—but an influence obtained like the spiritual power, the “merit”, accumulated by the Brahmanic hermits of India who practised “yogi”.",
    "As the mystery of creation was repeated at birth when a new soul came into existence, so did the Tao create new life when the devotee reached the desired state of complete and unquestioning submission to its workings.",
    "There were some Taoists who, like the Brahmanic hermits, sought refuge in solitary places and endeavoured to promote longevity by management of the breath, adopting what Mr. Balfour has called a “system of mystic and recondite calisthenics”.",
    "As we have seen, Lao Tze makes reference to “breathing exercises”, but apparently certain of his followers regarded the performance of these exercises as the sum and substance of his teachings, whereas they were but an aid towards attaining the state of mind which prepared the Taoist for submission to the Tao.",
    "Kwang Tze found it necessary to condemn the practices of those “scholars” who, instead of pursuing “the path of self cultivation”, endeavoured to accumulate “the breath of life” so that they might live as long as the patriarch Phăng.",
    "In his chapter, “Ingrained Ideas”, he writes: “Blowing and breathing with open mouth; inhaling and exhaling the breath; expelling the old breath and taking in new; passing their time like the (dormant) bear, and stretching and twisting (the neck) like a bird; all this simply shows the desire for longevity”.",
    "[513] The genuine devotees “enjoy their ease without resorting to the rivers and seas”, they “attain to longevity without the management (of the breath)”, they “forget all things and yet possess all things by cultivating the qualities of placidity, indifference, silence, quietude, absolute vacancy and non-action”.",
    "These qualities “are the substance of the Tao and its characteristics”.",
    "[514] It seems undoubted, however, that the system of Lao Tze, whereby “spiritual fluid” flowed into the placid, receptive mind, originated in the very practices here condemned—in the quest of “soul substance” contained in water, herbs, metals, and gems.",
    "As Indian and Chinese sages retired to solitudes and endured great privations, so that they might accumulate “merit”, so did the searchers for herbs, metals, and gems penetrate desert wastes and cross trackless mountains, so as to accumulate the wealth which was “merit” to them.",
    "They were inspired in like manner by genuine religious enthusiasm.",
    "The Taoists never forgot the “Elixir”.",
    "Taoism began with the quest of that elusive and mystical “It” which renewed youth and ensured immortality, or prolonged longevity after death, and the later Taoists revived or, perhaps one should say, perpetuated the search for “the Water of Life”, and the “Plant of Life”, the “Peach of 3000 years”, or “10,000 years”, the gem trees, gold, pearls, jade, &c.",
    "The fear of death obsessed their minds.",
    "They wished to live as long as the Patriarch Phăng on this earth, or to be transferred bodily to the Paradise of the West, the Paradise of Cloudland or Star-land, or that of the “Islands of the Blest”.",
    "Besides, it was necessary that the earthly life should be prolonged so that they might make complete submission to the Tao.",
    "Their lives had to be passed in tranquillity; they were not to reflect on the past or feel anxiety regarding the future.",
    "The fear of death in the future tended to disturb their peace of mind, and they were therefore in need of water which, like the water of Lethe, would make them forget their cares, or some other elixir that would inspire them with confidence and give them strength.",
    "Kwang Tze might censure the ascetics for confusing “the means” with “the end”, but ordinary men have always been prone to attach undue importance to ceremonies and rites—to concentrate their thoughts on the performance of rites rather than in accumulating “merit”, and to believe that “merit” can be accumulated by the performance of the rites alone.",
    "The explanation of the state of affairs censured by Kwang Tze seems to be that the transcendental teachings of Lao Tze and himself, in which the vague idea of the Logos was fused with belief in a vague elixir of life, were incomprehensible not only to the masses but even to scholars, and that the practices and beliefs of the older faith on which Lao Tze founded his system were perpetuated by custom and tradition by other adherents to the cult of which he was a teacher.",
    "Ordinary men, who were not by temperament or mental constitution or training either mystics or metaphysicians, required something more concrete than the elusive Tao of Lao and Kwang; they clung to their beliefs in the efficacy of life-prolonging herbs, jewels, metals, coloured stones, water, fresh air, &c. Withal, they required something to worship, having always been accustomed to perform religious ceremonies and offer up sacrifices.",
    "They could not worship or sacrifice to an abstraction like the Tao.",
    "Nor could they grasp the idea of an impersonal God as expressed in the writings of Kwang Tze, who taught: “God is a principle which exists by virtue of its own intrinsicality, and operates spontaneously without self-manifestation”.",
    "The people clung to their belief in a personal God, or personal gods including dragon-gods, and when the old deities believed in by their ancestors were discredited by their teachers, they deified Lao Tze and his disciples as the Indians deified Buddha and the Rishis.",
    "Lao Tze was sacrificed to in the second century B.C., and a superb temple was erected to him.",
    "One of the Emperors who embraced the Taoist faith caused the statue of Lao Tze to be carried into his palace, with pomp and ceremony.",
    "The ordinary priests in the temples of China were called Taoists.",
    "When Buddhism began to exercise an influence in China between the third century B.C. and the first century A.D., the Taoists borrowed from the Buddhists, while the Buddhists, in turn, borrowed from the Taoists.",
    "The myth then arose that when Lao Tze “went west”, he was reborn in India as the Buddha.",
    "But the Taoists clung also to the older myth that after Lao Tze died, he ascended to Cloudland and became the personal god of heaven, Shang Ti, the Supreme and Divine Emperor.",
    "It was as Shang Ti, a term which includes the spirits of deceased Emperors of China, he was worshipped not only in temples but at domestic shrines, along with the various groups of demi-gods, some of whom were identified with the disciples of Lao Tze.",
    "The Chinese Shang Ti, like the ancient Egyptian sun-god Ra and the Babylonian Marduk (Merodach), was the divine father of the living monarch.",

    "There was not only “culture” mixing but also a mixing of races in ancient times throughout the Japanese Archipelago.",
    "Distinct racial types can be detected in the present-day population.",
    "“Of these,” says the Japanese writer, Yei Ozaki, [515] “the two known as the patrician and the plebeian are the most conspicuous.",
    "The delicate oval face of the aristocrat or Mongoloid, with its aquiline nose, oblique eyes, high-arched eyebrows, bud-like mouth, cream-coloured skin, and slender frame, has been the favourite theme of artists for a thousand years, and is still the ideal of beauty to-day.",
    "The Japanese plebeian has the Malayan cast of countenance, high cheek-bones, large prognathic mouth, full, straight eyes, a skin almost as dark as bronze, and a robust, heavily-boned physique.",
    "The flat-faced, heavy-jawed, hirsute Ainu type, with luxuriant hair and long beards, is also frequently met with among the Japanese.",
    "Such are the diverse elements which go to comprise the race of the present time.”",
    "The oblique-eyed aristocrats—the Normans of Japan—appear to have come from Korea, and to have achieved political ascendancy as a result of conquest in the archæological “Iron Age”, when megalithic tombs of the corridor type, covered with mounds, were introduced.",
    "[516] They brought with them, in addition to distinctive burial customs, a heritage of Korean religious beliefs and myths regarding serpent- or dragon-gods of rivers and ocean, air and mountains.",
    "After coming into contact with other peoples in Japan, their mythology grew more complex, and assumed a local aspect.",
    "Chinese and Buddhist elements were subsequently added.",
    "There was no distinct “Bronze Age” in Japan.",
    "“Ancient bronze objects are,” says Laufer, “so scarce in Japan, that even granted they were indigenous, the establishment of a Bronze Age would not be justified, nor is there in the ancient records any positive evidence of the use of bronze.”",
    "[517] Although stone implements have been found, it is uncertain whether there ever was, in the strict Western European sense, a “Neolithic Age”.",
    "The earliest inhabitants of the islands could not have reached them until after ships came into use in the Far East, and therefore after the culture of those who used metals had made its influence felt over wide areas.",
    "As we have seen (Chapter III), the most archaic ships in the Kamschatka area in the north, and in the Malayan area in the south, were of Egyptian type, having apparently been introduced by the early prospectors who searched for pearls and precious stones and metals.",
    "In the oldest Japanese writings, the records of ancient oral traditions, gold and silver are referred to as “yellow” and “white” metals existing in Korea, while bronze, when first mentioned, is called the “Chinese metal” and the “Korean metal”.",
    "[518] “The bronze and iron objects found in the ancient graves have simply,” says Laufer, “been imported from the mainland, and plainly are, in the majority of cases, of Chinese manufacture.",
    "Many of these, like metal mirrors, certain helmets, and others, have been recognized as such; but through comparison with corresponding Chinese material, the same can be proved for the rest.”",
    "[519] At the beginning of our era, the Japanese, as the annals of the Later Han Dynasty of China record, purchased iron in Korea.",
    "The Chinese and Koreans derived the knowledge of how to work iron from the interior of Siberia, the Turkish Yakut there being the older and better iron-workers.",
    "[520] The racial fusion in ancient Japan was not complete.",
    "Although the Koreans, Chinese, and Malayans intermarried and became “Japanese”, communities of the Ainu never suffered loss of identity, and lived apart from the conquerors and those of their kinsmen who were absorbed by them.",
    "An outstanding feature of Japanese archæology is that Culture A appears to have been a higher one than Culture B, which is represented by Ainu artifacts.",
    "Culture A is that of a pre-Ainu people whom the Ainu found inhabiting parts of the archipelago, and called the Koro-pok-guru.",
    "The name signifies “the people having depressions”, and is usually rendered by Western writers as “Pit-dwellers”.",
    "In the Japanese writings the Koro-pok-guru are referred to as “the small people” and “earth spiders”.",
    "During the winter season the Koro-pok-guru lived in pit-houses, with conical or beehive roofs.",
    "The depth of these earth houses was greater on slopes and exposed heights than on low-lying ground.",
    "In summer they occupied beehive houses erected on the level.",
    "Their “kitchen-midden” deposits have yielded pottery, including well-shaped vases, and arrowheads of flint, obsidian, reddish jasper or dark siliceous rock.",
    "Like the “pit-dwellers” of Saghalin and Kamschatka, the Koro-pok-guru were seafarers and fishers.",
    "Their houses were erected on river banks and along the sea coast.",
    "Culture B deposits are devoid of pottery.",
    "The Ainu have never been potters; their bowls and spoons were in ancient times made of wood.",
    "They claim to have exterminated the Koro-pok-guru, who appear to have had affinities with the present inhabitants of the northern Kuriles, a people of short stature, with roundish heads, the men having short, thick beards, and being quite different in general appearance from the “hairy Ainu” with long, flowing beards.",
    "Some communities of Ainu present physical characteristics that suggest the blending in ancient times of the “long beards” and “short beards”.",
    "The pure Ainu are the hairiest people in the world.",
    "They are broad-headed and have brown eyes and black beards, and are of sturdy build.",
    "Their tibia and humerus bones are somewhat flat.",
    "In old age some resemble the inhabitants of Great Russia.",
    "The Ainu [521] are hunters and fishers.",
    "Their women cultivate millet (their staple food) and vegetables, and gather herbs and roots among the mountains.",
    "According to their own traditions, they came from Sara, which means a “plain”.",
    "Their “culture hero”, Okikurumi, descended from heaven to a mountain in Piratoru, [522] having been delegated by the Creator to teach the Ainu religion and law.",
    "Before this hero returned to heaven, he married Turesh Machi, [523] and he left his son, Waruinekuru, to instruct the Ainu “how to make cloth, to hunt and fish, how to make poison and set the spring-bow in the trail of animals”.",
    "When Okikurumi first arrived among the Ainu, the crust of the earth was still thin and “all was burning beneath”.",
    "It was impossible for people to go a-hunting without scorching their feet.",
    "The celestial hero arranged that his wife should distribute food, but made it a condition that no human being would dare to look in her face.",
    "She went daily from house to house thrusting in the food with her great hands.",
    "An inquisitive Ainu, of the “Peeping Tom” order, resolved to satisfy his curiosity regarding the mysterious food-distributor.",
    "One morning he seized her and pulled her into his house, whereupon she was immediately transformed into a wriggling serpent-dragon.",
    "A terrible thunderstorm immediately broke out, and the house of “Peeping Tom” was destroyed by lightning.",
    "This is an interesting Far Eastern version of the Godiva legend",
    "[524] of Coventry.",
    "Greatly angered by the breaking of the taboo, Okikurumi returned to the celestial regions.",
    "His dragon-wife is not only a Godiva, but another Far Eastern Melusina.",
    "[525] Okikurumi is said to have worn ear-rings.",
    "He had therefore a solar connection.",
    "The Aryo-Indian hero, Karna, son of Surya, the sun-god, who emerged from an ear of his human mother, Princess Pritha, was similarly adorned at birth with ear-rings.",
    "The Ainu have from the earliest times considered it essential that they should all wear ear-rings, and the ears of males and females are bored in childhood.",
    "It was similarly a ceremonial practice in ancient Peru to bore the ears of Inca princes.",
    "Jacob objected to his wives wearing ear-rings, and buried those so-called “ornaments” with the gods of Laban under an oak at Shechem.",
    "[526] Bracelets and “ear-ornaments” were similarly favoured as religious charms and symbols by the Ainu.",
    "It is of special interest to note that mummification was practised by some Ainu tribes or families.",
    "Whether or not they acquired this custom from the Koro-pok-guru is uncertain.",
    "Women tattooed their arms, their upper and lower lips, and sometimes their foreheads.",
    "Tattooing and mummification similarly obtained among the Aleutian Islanders.",
    "The same peculiar methods of preserving corpses obtained among the Ainu, the Aleutians, and certain Red Indian tribes of North America.",
    "[527] Another link between the Old and New Worlds is afforded by American-Asiatic bone plate armour.",
    "[528] Like the Ostiaks and other Siberian tribes, the Ainu worship the bear.",
    "Their bear feasts are occasions for heavy drinking and much dancing and singing.",
    "Drunkenness is to them “supreme bliss”.",
    "The bear-goddess was the wife of the dragon-god.",
    "She had a human lover, and that is why bears, her descendants, “are half like a human being”.",
    "The salmon is divine, and its symbol is worshipped.",
    "Folk-tales are told regarding salmon taking human shape, as do the seals in Scottish Gaelic stories.",
    "As in China and Japan, the fox is the most subtle of all beasts.",
    "It supplanted the tiger as chief god, according to an Ainu folk-tale.",
    "There is a great tortoise-god in the sea and an owl-god on the land, and their children have intermarried.",
    "The cock is of celestial origin.",
    "It was, at the beginning, sent down from heaven by the Creator to ascertain what the world looked like, but tarried for so long a time, being well pleased with things, that it was forbidden to return.",
    "Hares are mountain deities.",
    "The oldest trees are the oak and pine, and they are therefore sacred, and the oldest and most sacred herb is the mugwort.",
    "In Kamschatka the pine is associated with the mugwort.",
    "The mugwort is connected with goddesses of the Artemis order.",
    "[529] Sacred, too, was the willow, and specially sacred the mistletoe that grew on a willow tree.",
    "An elixir prepared from the mistletoe was supposed to renew youth, and therefore to prolong life and cure diseases.",
    "Siberians venerate the herb willow.",
    "[530] The drink prepared from it was a soporific for human beings, wild animals, and deities.",
    "Far Eastern deities had apparently to be soothed as well as invoked as, it may be recalled, was Hathor-Sekhet in the Egyptian “flood myth”, when she was given beer poured out from jars, so that she might cease from slaughtering mankind.",
    "[531] When the Ainu performed religious ceremonies, shavings and whittled sticks of willow were used, and libations of intoxicating liquors provided.",
    "Deities were made drunk, as in Babylonia, [532] and then provided with a soothing anti-intoxicant.",
    "The Ainu set up their willow sticks at wells and around their dwellings.",
    "They had no temples, and when they worshipped the sun, a shaven willow stick was placed at the east end of a house.",
    "The moon-god came next in order to the sun-god.",
    "The fire-god was invoked to cure disease.",
    "There was a subtle connection between fire and mistletoe, perhaps because fire was obtained by friction of soft and hard wood, and an intoxicating elixir prepared from a tree or its parasite was believed to be “fire water”—that is, “water of life”.",
    "Offerings were made to gods of ocean, rivers, and mountains.",
    "The world was supposed to be floating on and surrounded by water, and to be resting on the spine of a gigantic fish which caused earthquakes when it moved.",
    "There were two heavens—one above the clouds and another in the Underworld.",
    "A hell, from which the volcanoes vomit fire, was reserved for the wicked.",
    "Like the Chinese, the Ainu tell stories of visits paid to Paradise.",
    "A man, whose wife had been spirited away, appealed to the oak-god, who provided him with a golden horse on which he rode to the sky.",
    "He reached a beautiful city in which people went about singing constantly.",
    "They smelled a stranger, and, the smell being offensive to them, they appealed to the chief god to give him his wife.",
    "The god promised to do so if the visitor would agree to go away at once.",
    "He consented readily, and returned to the oak-god, who told him his wife was in hell, and that the place was now in confusion because the chief god had ordered a search to be made for her.",
    "Soon afterwards the lost woman was restored to her husband.",
    "This man was given the golden horse to keep, and all the horses in Ainu-land are descended from it.",
    "Another man once chased a bear on a mountain side.",
    "The animal entered a cave, and he followed it, passing through a long, dark tunnel.",
    "He reached the beautiful land of the Underworld.",
    "Feeling hungry, he ate grapes and mulberries, and, to his horror, was immediately transformed into a serpent.",
    "He crawled back to the entrance and fell asleep below a pine tree.",
    "In his dream the goddess of the tree appeared.",
    "She told him he had been transformed into a serpent because he had eaten of the food of Hades, and that, if he wished to be restored to human shape, he must climb to the top of the tree and fling himself down.",
    "When he awoke, the man-serpent did as the goddess advised.",
    "After leaping from the tree top, he found himself standing below it, while near him lay the body of a great serpent which had been split open.",
    "He then went through the tunnel and emerged from the cave.",
    "But later he had another dream, in which the goddess appeared and told him he must return to the Underworld because a goddess there had fallen in love with him.",
    "He did as he was commanded to do, and was never again seen on earth.",
    "A story tells of another Ainu who reached this Paradise.",
    "He saw many people he had known in the world, but they were unable to see him.",
    "Only the dogs perceived him, and they growled and barked.",
    "Catching sight of his father and mother he went forward to embrace them, but they complained of being haunted by an evil spirit, and he had to leave them.",
    "The Ainu have a Deluge Myth which tells that when the waters rose the vast majority of human beings were destroyed.",
    "Only a remnant escaped by ascending to the summit of a high mountain.",
    "[533] Although the Ainu claimed to have exterminated the Koro-pok-guru, it is possible that they really intermixed with them and derived some of their religious ideas and myths from them, and that, in turn, the Japanese were influenced by both Ainu and Koro-pok-guru ideas and myths.",
    "The aniconic pillars and the female goddess with fish termination (the Dragon Mother) figure in Japanese as well as Ainu religion.",
    "Both are found in Kamschatka, too.",
    "Dr. Rendel Harris, commenting on the pillar and fish-goddess idols of the Kamschatdals, [534] recalls “the various fish forms of Greek and Oriental religions, the Dagon and Derceto of the Philistines, the Oannes of the Assyrians, [535] Eurynome of the Greek legends, and the like”.",
    "The pillar, sometimes shown to be clad with ivy, links with the symbols of Hermes and Dionysos.",
    "He adds: “The Kamschatdals and other Siberian tribes manufacture for themselves intoxicating and stupefying drinks which have a religious value, and are employed by their Shamans in order to produce prophetic states of inspiration”.",
    "The Japanese manufactured sake from rice with precisely the same motive, and, like the Ainu, offered their liquor to the gods.",
    "What attracted the Koro-pok-guru and the Ainu to Japan?",
    "As we have seen (Chapter III), the primary incentive for sea-trafficking and prospecting by sea and land was the desire to obtain wealth in the form of pearls, precious stones, and metals.",
    "Now, pearls are found round the Japanese coasts.",
    "Marco Polo has recorded that in his day the people of Japan practised the mortuary custom (obtaining also in China) of placing pearls in the mouths of the dead.",
    "“In the Island of Zipangu [536] (Japan),” he says, “rose-coloured pearls were abundant, and quite as valuable as white ones.”",
    "Kaempfer, writing in the eighteenth century, stated that the Japanese pearls were found in small varieties of oysters (akoja) resembling the Persian pearl oyster, and also in “the yellow snail-shell”, the taira gai (Placuna), and the awabi or abalone (Haliotis).",
    "A pearl fishery formerly existed in the neighbourhood of Saghalin Island.",
    "As pearls have from the earliest times been fished from southern Manchurian rivers, in Kamschatka, and on the south coast of the Sea of Okhotsk, it may be that the earliest settlers in Japan were prehistoric pearl-fishers.",
    "It is of special interest to note here that, according to G. A. Cooke, pearls and ginseng (mandrake) were formerly Manchurian articles of commerce.",
    "[537] The herbs and pearls were, as we have seen, regarded as “avatars” of the mother-goddess.",
    "In Korea ginseng is cultivated under Government supervision.",
    "“It is”, Mrs. Bishop writes,",
    "[538] “one of the most valuable articles which Korea exports, and one great source of its revenue.”",
    "A basket may contain ginseng worth £4000.",
    "“But,” she adds, “valuable as the cultivated root is, it is nothing to the value of the wild, which grows in Northern Korea, a single specimen of which has been sold for £40!",
    "It is chiefly found in the Kang-ge Mountains, but it is rare, and the search so often ends in failure, that the common people credit it with magical properties, and believe that only men of pure lives can find it.”",
    "The dæmon who is “the tutelary spirit of ginseng ... is greatly honoured” (p. 243).",
    "A ready market is found in China for Korean ginseng.",
    "“It is a tonic, a febrifuge, a stomachic, the very elixir of life, taken spasmodically or regularly in Chinese wine by most Chinese who can afford it” (p. 95).",
    "In Japan, ginseng, mushroom, and fungus are, like pearls, promoters of longevity, and sometimes, says Joly, “masquerade as phalli”: they are “Plants of Life” and “Plants of Birth”, like the plants searched for by the Babylonian heroes Gilgamesh and Etana, and like the dragon-herbs of China.",
    "[539] In Shinto, the ancient religion of the Japanese, prominence is given to pearls and other precious jewels, and even to ornaments like artificial beads, which were not, of course, used merely for personal decoration in the modern sense of the term; beads had a religious significance.",
    "A sacred jewel is a tama, a name which has deep significance in Japan, because mi-tama is a soul, or spirit, or double.",
    "Mi is usually referred to as an “honorific prefix” or “honorific epithet”, but it appears to have been originally something more than that.",
    "A Japanese commentator, as De Visser notes, has pointed out in another connection [540] that mi is “an old word for snake”, that is, for a snake-dragon.",
    "Mi-tama, therefore, may as “soul” or “double” be all that is meant by “snake-pearl” or “dragon-pearl”.",
    "[541] The pearl, as we have seen, contained “soul substance”, the “vital principle”, the blood of the Great Mother, like the “jasper of Isis” worn by women to promote birth, and therefore to multiply and prolong life; in China and Japan the pearl was placed in the mouth of the dead to preserve the corpse from decay and ensure longevity or immortality.",
    "The connection between jewels and medicine is found among the Maya of Central America.",
    "Cit Bolon Tun (the “nine precious stones”) was a god of medicine.",
    "The goddess Ix Tub Tun (“she who spits out precious stones”) was “the goddess of the workers in jade and amethysts”.",
    "She links with Tlaloc’s wife.",
    "According to Dr. W. G. Aston [542] tama contains the root of the verb tabu, “to give”, more often met with in its lengthened form tamafu.",
    "“Tama retains its original significance in tama-mono, a gift thing, and toshi-dama, a new year’s present.",
    "Tama next means something valuable, as a jewel.",
    "Then, as jewels are mostly globular in shape, [543] it has come to mean anything round.",
    "At the same time, owing to its precious quality, it is used symbolically for the sacred emanation from God which dwells in his shrine, and also for that most precious thing, the human life or soul....",
    "The element tama enters into the names of several deities.",
    "The food-goddess is called either Ukemochi no Kami or Uka no mi-tama.”",
    "Phallic deities are also referred to as mi-tama.",
    "The mi-tama is sometimes used in much the same sense as the Egyptian Ka: it is the spirit or double of a deity which dwells in a shrine, where it is provided with a shintai (“god body”)—a jewel, weapon, stone, mirror, pillow, or some such object.",
    "The jewels (tama) worn by gods and human beings were not, as already insisted upon, merely ornaments, but objects possessing “soul substance”.",
    "These are referred to in the oldest Shinto books.",
    "In ancient Japanese graves archæologists have found round beads (tama), “oblong perforated cylinders” or “tube-shaped beads” (kuda-tama), and “curved” or “comma-shaped [544] beads” (maga-tama).",
    "According to W. Gowland, “the stones of which maga-tama are made are rock-crystal, steatite, jasper, agate, and chalcedony, and more rarely chrysoprase and nephrite (jade)”.",
    "He notes that “the last two minerals are not found in Japan”.",
    "[545] Henri L. Joly, writing on the tama, says [546] it is also “represented in the form of a pearl tapering to a pointed apex, and scored with several rings.",
    "It receives amongst other names Nio-i-Hojiu, and more rarely of Shinshi, the latter word being used for the spherical jewel, one of the three relics left to Ninigi",
    "no Mikoto",
    "[547] by his grandmother, Amaterâsu.",
    "[548] The necklace of Shinshi, mentioned in the traditions, was lost, and in its place a large crystal ball, some three or four inches in diameter, is kept and carried by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor on State occasions.”",
    "[**ERROR: Contains unhandled entity &c.;]",
    "The pearl (tama) is “one of the treasures of the Takaramono, a collection of objects associated with the Japanese gods of luck, which includes the hat of invisibility (Kakuregasa), a lion playing with a jewel, a jar containing coral, coins, &c.; coral branches (sangoju), the cowrie shell (kai), an orange-like fruit, the five-coloured feather robe of the Tennins, the winged maidens of the Buddhist paradise, copper cash, &c.”",
    "[549] But although the tama may correspond to the mani of the Indian Buddhists, it was not of Buddhist origin in Japan; the Buddhists simply added to the stock of Japanese “luck jewels”.",
    "The tama of jade has raised an interesting problem.",
    "Nephrite is not found in Japan.",
    "“It is difficult”, says Laufer, “to decide from what source, how and when the nephrite or jadeite material was transmitted to Japan.”",
    "Referring to jade objects found in the prehistoric Japanese graves, he says: “The jewels may go back, after all, to an early period when historical intercourse between Japan and China was not yet established; they [550] represent two clearly distinct and characteristic types, such as are not found in the jewelry of ancient China.",
    "If the Japanese maga-tama and kuda-tama would correspond to any known Chinese forms, it would be possible to give a plausible reason for the presence of jade in the ancient Japanese tombs; but such a coincidence of type cannot be brought forward.",
    "Nor is it likely that similar pieces will be discovered in China, as necklaces were never used there anciently or in modern times.",
    "We must therefore argue that the two Japanese forms of ornamental stones were either indigenous inventions or borrowed from some other non-Chinese culture sphere in south-eastern Asia, the antiquities of which are unknown to us.”",
    "[551] The tama is of great importance in Shinto religion.",
    "At Ise, [552] “the Japanese Mecca”, which has long been visited by pious pilgrims, a virgin daughter of the Mikado used to keep watch over the three imperial insignia—the mirror, the sword, and the jewel (tama)—which had been handed down from Mikado to Mikado.",
    "There were no idols in the temples.",
    "The Shintai was carefully wrapped up and kept in a box in the “holy of holies”, a screened-off part of the simple and unadorned wooden and thatched little temple.",
    "The temple was entered through a gateway—the tori wi, a word which means “bird-perch”, in the sense of a hen-roost.",
    "“As an honorary gateway”, says Dr. Aston, “the tori-wi is a continental institution identical in purpose and resembling in form the toran of India, the pailoo of China, and the hong-sal-mun of Korea.”",
    "[553] When this symbol of Artemis [554] was introduced into Japan is uncertain.",
    "“Rock gates” were of great sanctity in old Japan.",
    "There is one at Ise—the “twin-rocks of Ise”.",
    "The mirror was the shintai (god-body) of the sun-goddess; the sword was the shintai of the dragon; and the jewel (tama) was the shintai of the Great Mother, who was the inexhaustible womb of nature.",
    "At sacred Ise, the chief deities worshipped were Ama-terâsu, the goddess of the sun, and Toyouke-hime, the goddess of food.",
    "[555] The high-priest was the Mikado, who was a Kami (a god), and called “the Heavenly Grandchild”, his heir being “august child of the sun”, and his residence “the august house of the sun”.",
    "[556] After the Mikado had ascended the throne, the Ohonihe (great food offering) ceremony was performed.",
    "It was “the most solemn and important festival of the Shinto religion”, says Aston, who quotes the following explanation of it by a modern Japanese writer: “Anciently the Mikado received the auspicious grain from the Gods of Heaven and therewithal nourished the people.",
    "In the Daijowe (or Ohonihe) the Mikado, when the grain became ripe, joined unto him the people in sincere veneration, and, as in duty bound, made return to the Gods of Heaven.",
    "He thereafter partook of it along with the nation.",
    "Thus the people learnt that the grain which they eat is no other than the seed bestowed on them by the Gods of Heaven.”",
    "The Mikado was thus, in a sense, a Japanese Osiris.",
    "Shinto religion was in pre-Buddhist days a system of ceremonies and laws on which the whole social structure rested.",
    "The name is a Chinese word meaning “the way of the gods”, the Japanese equivalent being Kami no michi.",
    "But although the gods were numerous, only a small proportion of them played an important part in the ritual (norito), which was handed down orally by generations of priests until after the fifth century of our era, when a native script, based on Chinese characters, came into use.",
    "Old Shinto was concerned chiefly with the food-supply, with child-getting, with the preservation of health, and protection against calamities caused by floods, droughts, fire, or earthquakes.",
    "It has little or nothing to say regarding the doctrine of immortality.",
    "There was no heaven and no hell.",
    "The spirits of some of these deities who died like ordinary mortals went to the land of Yomi, as did also the spirit of the Mikado, but little is told regarding the mysterious Otherworld in which dwelt the spirits of disease and death.",
    "“In one passage of the Nihon-gi,” says Aston, [557] “Yomi is clearly no more than a metaphor for the grave.”",
    "It thus resembled the dark Otherworld or Underworld of the Babylonians, from which Gilgamesh summoned the spirit of his dead friend, Ea-bani.",
    "[558] No spirit of a god could escape from Yomi after eating “the food of the dead”.",
    "When the Babylonian god Adapa, son of Ea, was summoned to appear in the Otherworld, his father warned him not to accept of the water and food which would be offered him.",
    "[559] The goddess Ishtar was struck with disease when she entered Hades in quest of her lover, the god Tammuz, and it was not until she had been sprinkled with the “water of life” that she was healed and liberated.",
    "[560] The Mikado, being a god, had a spirit, and might be transferred to Yomi or might ascend to heaven to the celestial realm of his ancestress, the sun-goddess.",
    "Some distinguished men had spirits likewise.",
    "But there is no clear evidence in the Ko-ji-ki or the Nihon-gi that the spirits of the common people went anywhere after death, or indeed, that they were supposed to have spirits.",
    "Some might become birds, or badgers, or foxes, and live for a period in these forms, and then die, as did some of the gods.",
    "There are no ghosts in the early Shinto books.",
    "[561] The ancient Pharaohs of Egypt, like the ancient Mikados of Japan, were assured of immortality.",
    "The mortuary Pyramid Texts “were all intended for the king’s exclusive use, and as a whole contain beliefs which apply only to the king”.",
    "There are vague references in these texts to the dead “whose places are hidden”, and to those who remain in the grave.",
    "[562] The fate of the masses did not greatly concern the solar cult.",
    "Before dealing with the myths of Japan, it is necessary to consider what the term kami, usually translated “gods”, signified to the devotees of “Old Shinto”.",
    "The kami were not spiritual beings, but many of them had spirits or doubles that resided in the shintai (god body).",
    "Dr. Aston reminds us that although kami “corresponds in a general way to ‘god’, it has some important limitations.",
    "The kami are high, swift, good, rich, living but not infinite, omnipotent, or omniscient.",
    "Most of them had a father and mother, and of some the death is recorded.”",
    "[563] It behoves us to exercise caution in applying the term “animistic” to the numerous kami of Japan, or in assuming that they were worshipped, or reverenced rather, simply because they were feared.",
    "Some of the kami were feared, but the fear of the gods is not a particular feature of Shinto religion with its ceremonial hand-clappings and happy laughter.",
    "Dr. Aston quotes from Motöori, the great eighteenth century Shinto theologian, the following illuminating statement regarding the kami: “The term kami is applied in the first place to the various deities of heaven and earth who are mentioned in the ancient records as well as to their spirits (mi-tama) which reside in the shrines where they were worshipped.",
    "Moreover, not only human beings, but birds, beasts, plants, and trees, seas and mountains, and all other things whatsoever which deserve to be dreaded and revered for the extraordinary and pre-eminent powers which they possess are called kami.",
    "They need not be eminent for surpassing nobleness, or serviceableness alone.",
    "Malignant and uncanny beings are also called kami if only they are objects of general dread.",
    "Among kami who are human beings, I need hardly mention, first of all, the successive Mikados—with reverence be it spoken....",
    "Then there have been numerous examples of divine human beings, both in ancient and modern times, who, although not accepted by the nation generally, are treated as gods, each of his several dignity, in a single province, village, or family.”",
    "In ancient Egypt the reigning monarch was similarly a god—a Horus while he lived and an Osiris after he died, while a great scholar like Imhotep (the Imuthes of the Greeks in Egypt who identified him with Asklepois) might be deified and regarded as the son of Ptah, the god of Memphis.",
    "Egypt, too, had its local gods like Japan; so had Babylonia.",
    "The Japanese theologian proceeds to say: “Amongst kami who are not human beings, I need hardly mention Thunder (in Japanese Nuru kami or the sounding-god).",
    "There are also the Dragon and Echo (called in Japanese Ko-dama or the Tree Spirit), and the Fox, who are kami by reason of their uncanny and fearful natures.",
    "The term kami is applied in the Nihon-gi and Manjoshiu to the tiger and the wolf.",
    "Isanagi (the creator-god) gave to the fruit of the peach and to the jewels round his neck names which implied that they were kami.”",
    "[564] Here we touch on beliefs similar to those that obtained in China where the dragon and tiger figure so prominently as the gods of the East and the West.",
    "The idea that the peach was a kami appears to be connected with the Chinese conception of a peach world-tree, a form of the Mother Goddess, the fruit of which contains her “life substance” or shen as do the jewels like the pearl and jade objects; the peach is a goddess symbol as the phallus is a symbol of a god.",
    "Motöori adds: “There are many cases of seas and mountains being called kami.",
    "It is not their spirits which are meant.",
    "The word was applied directly to the seas or mountains themselves as being very awful things.”",
    "[565] There were a beneficent class and an evil class of kami.",
    "Beneficent deities provided what mankind required or sought for; they were protectors and preservers.",
    "Four guardians of the world were called “Shi Tenno”.",
    "They were posted at the cardinal points like the Chinese Black Tortoise (north), the Red Bird (south), the White Tiger (west), and the Blue or Green Dragon (east).",
    "The Japanese colour scheme, however, is not the same as the Chinese.",
    "At the north is the blue god Bishamon or Tamoten; at the south the white-faced warrior Zocho; at the west the red-faced Komoku with book and brush or a spear; and at the east the warrior with green face, named Jikoku, who is sometimes shown trampling a demon under foot.",
    "In India the north is white and the south black, and in Ceylon the Buddhist colours of the cardinal points are yellow (north), blue (south), red (west), and white (east).",
    "Although it is customary to regard the coloured guardians of the Japanese world as of Buddhist origin, it may well be that the original Japanese guardians were substituted by the Hindu and Chinese divinities imported by the Buddhists.",
    "The dragon-gods of China and Japan were pre-Buddhistic, as De Visser has shown, [566] but were given, in addition to their original attributes, those of the naga (serpent or dragon) gods introduced by Buddhist priests.",

    "There is no Shinto myth regarding the creation of man; the Mikados and the chiefs of tribes were descendants of deities.",
    "Nor is there a Deluge Myth like the Ainu one, involving the destruction of all but a remnant of mankind.",
    "The Chinese story about Nu Kwa, known to the Japanese as Jokwa, was apparently imported with the beliefs associated with the jade which that mythical queen or goddess was supposed to have created after she had caused the flood to retreat, but it does not find a place in the ancient Shinto books.",
    "There is, however, an interesting version of the Egyptian flood story which has been fused with the Babylonian Tiamat dragon-slaying myth.",
    "Susa-no-wo, [567] a Far Eastern Marduk, slays an eight-headed dragon and splits up its body, from which he takes a spirit-sword—an avatar of the monster.",
    "Hathor-Sekhet, of the Egyptian myth, was made drunk, so that she might cease from slaying mankind, and a flood of blood-red beer was poured from jars for that purpose.",
    "Susa-no-wo provides sake (rice beer) to intoxicate the dragon which has been coming regularly—apparently once a year—for a daughter of an earth god.",
    "When he slays it, the River Hi is “changed into a river of blood”.",
    "Another version of the Egyptian myth, as the Pyramid Texts bear evidence, appears to refer to the “Red Nile” of the inundation season as the blood of Osiris, who had been felled by Set at Nedyt, near Abydos.",
    "[568] Lucian tells that the blood of Adonis was similarly believed to redden each year the flooded River of Adonis, flowing from Lebanon, and that “it dyed the sea to a large space red”.",
    "[569] Here Adonis is the Osiris of the Byblians.",
    "Osiris, as we have seen, had a dragon form; he was the dragon of the Nile flood, and the world-surrounding dragon of ocean.",
    "[570] He was also the earth-giant; tree and grain grew from his body.",
    "[571] The body of the eight-headed Japanese dragon was covered with moss and trees.",
    "Susa-no-wo, as the rescuer of the doomed maiden, links with Perseus, the rescuer of Andromeda from the water-dragon.",
    "[572] The custom of sacrificing a maiden to the Nile each year obtained in Ancient Egypt.",
    "In the Tiamat form of the Babylonian myth, Marduk cut the channels of the dragon’s blood and “made the north wind bear it away into secret places”.",
    "[573] The stories of Pʼan Ku of China and the Scandinavian Ymir, each of whose blood is the sea, are interesting variants of the legend.",
    "[574] The Japanese dragon-flood myth is merely an incident in the career of a hero in Shinto mythology, which is a mosaic of local or localized and imported stories, somewhat clumsily arranged in the form of a connected narrative.",
    "Our chief sources of information regarding these ancient Japanese myths are the Shinto works, the Ko-ji-ki and the Nihon-gi.",
    "[575] Of these works, the Ko-ji-ki (“Records of Ancient Matters”) is the oldest; it was completed in Japanese in A.D. 712; the Nihon-gi (“Chronicles of Japan”) was completed in A.D. 720 in the Chinese language.",
    "Although the myths, formerly handed down orally by generations of priests, were not collected and systematized until about 200 years after Buddhism was introduced into Japan, they were not greatly influenced by Indian ideas.",
    "Dragon-lore, however, became so complex that it is difficult to sift the local from the imported elements.",
    "In the preface to the Ko-ji-ki, Yasumaro, the compiler, in his summary, writes: “Now when chaos had begun to condense, but force and form were not yet manifest, and there was nought named, nought done, who could know its shape?",
    "Nevertheless Heaven and Earth first parted, and the Three Deities performed the commencement of Creation; the Passive and Active Essences then developed, and the Two Spirits became the Ancestors of all things.”",
    "The myth of the separation of Heaven and Earth dates back to remote antiquity in Egypt.",
    "Shu, the atmosphere-god, separated the sky-goddess Nut from the earth-god Seb.",
    "In Polynesian mythology Rangi (Heaven), and Papa (Earth), from whom “all things originated”, were “rent apart” by Tane-mahuta, “the god and father of forests, of birds, of insects”.",
    "But in this case the earth is the mother and the sky the father.",
    "[576] About the “Three Deities” referred to by Yasumaro, we do not learn much.",
    "The idea of the trinity may have been of Indian origin.",
    "The Passive and Active Essences recall the male Yang and its female Yin principles of China.",
    "These are represented in the Ko-ji-ki by Izanagi (“Male who Invites”) and Izanami (“Female who Invites”).",
    "Dr. Aston translates the opening passage of the Nihon-gi as follows: “Of old, Heaven and Earth were not yet separated, and the In and the Yo not yet divided.",
    "They formed a chaotic mass like an egg, which was of obscurely defined limits, and contained germs.",
    "The purer and clearer part was thinly diffused and formed Heaven, while the heavier and grosser element settled down and became Earth.",
    "The finer element easily became a united body, but the consolidation of the heavy and gross element was accomplished with difficulty.",
    "Heaven was therefore formed first, and Earth established subsequently.",
    "Thereafter divine beings were produced between them.”",
    "Here we meet with the cosmic egg, from which emerged the Chinese Pʼan Ku, the Indian Brahma, the Egyptian Ra or Horus, and one of the Polynesian creators.",
    "It might be held that China is the source of the Japanese myth, because the In and the Yo are here, quite evidently the Yang and the Yin, representing not Izanagi and Izanami as in the Ko-ji-ki, but the deities of heaven and earth.",
    "But the Ko-ji-ki form of the myth may be the oldest, and we may have in the Nihon-gi evidence of Chinese ideas having been superimposed on those already obtaining in Japan, into which they were imported from other areas.",
    "But to return to the Creation myth.",
    "An ancient native work, the Kiu-ji-ki, which has not yet been translated into English, refers to seven generations of gods, beginning with one of doubtful sex, in whose untranslatable name the sun, moon, earth, and moisture are mentioned.",
    "This First Parent of the deities was the offspring of Heaven and Earth.",
    "The last couple is Izanagi and Izanami, brother and sister, like Osiris and Isis, who became man and wife.",
    "According to the Ko-ji-ki the first three deities came into being in Takama-no-hara, the “Plain of High Heaven”.",
    "They were alone, and afterwards disappeared, i.e. died.",
    "The narrative continues: “The names of the deities that were born next from a thing that sprouted up like unto a reed-shoot when the earth, young and like unto floating oil, drifted about medusa-like, [577] were the Pleasant-Reed-Shoot-Prince-Elder-Deity, next the Heavenly-Eternally-Standing-Deity.",
    "These two Deities were likewise born alone, and hid their persons.”",
    "[578] Earth and mud deities followed, and also the other deities who were before Izanagi and Izanami.",
    "It may be that the “reed-shoot” was the Japanese nig-gil-ma.",
    "(See Chapter XIII.)",
    "As in one of the early Sumerian texts, the mysterious plant, impregnated with preserving and perpetuating “life substance”, was the second product of Creation.",
    "Izanagi and Izanami were told by the elder deities that they must “make, consolidate, and give birth to this drifting land”.",
    "They were then given the Ame no tama-boko, the “Celestial Jewel-spear”.",
    "It is suggested that the spear is a phallic symbol.",
    "The jewel (tama) is “life substance”.",
    "Izanagi and Izanami stood on “the floating bridge of heaven”, which Aston identifies with the rainbow, or, as some Japanese scholars put it, the “Heavenly Rock Boat”, or “Heavenly Stairs”, and pushed down the tama-boko and groped with it until they found the ocean.",
    "According to the Ko-ji-ki, they “stirred the brine until it went curdle-curdle (koworo-koworo)”, that is, as Chamberlain suggests, “thick and glutinous”.",
    "Others think the passage should be translated so as to indicate that the brine gave forth “a curdling sound”.",
    "When the primæval waters and the oily mud began to “curdle” or “cook”, the deities drew up the spear.",
    "Some of the cosmic “porridge” dropped from the point and formed an island, which was named Onogoro (“self-curdling”, or “self-condensed”).",
    "The deities descended from heaven and erected on the island an eight-fathom house",
    "[579] with a central pillar.",
    "Here we meet with the aniconic pillar, the “herm” of Kamschatkan religion, the pillar of the Vedic world-house erected by the Aryo-Indian god Indra, the “branstock” of Scandinavian religion, the pillar of the “Lion Gate” of Mycenæ; the “pillar” is the “world spine”, like the Indian Mount Meru.",
    "[580] “The central pillar of a house (corresponding to our king-post) is,” writes Dr. Aston, “at the present day, an object of honour in Japan as in many other countries.",
    "In the case of Shinto shrines, it is called Nakago no mibashira (‘central august pillar’), and in ordinary houses the Daikoku-bashira.”",
    "[581] Izanagi and Izanami become man and wife by performing the ceremony of going round the pillar and meeting one another face to face.",
    "Their first-born is Hiruko (leech-child).",
    "At the age of three he was still unable to stand upright, and was in consequence placed in a reed boat and set adrift on the ocean.",
    "Here we have what appears to be a version of the Moses story.",
    "The Indian Karna, who is similarly set adrift, was a son of Surya, god of the sun.",
    "The Egyptian Horus was concealed after birth on a floating island, and he was originally a solar deity with a star form.",
    "[582] Ra, the Egyptian sun-god, drifted across the heavens on reed floats before he was given a boat.",
    "Osiris was, after death, set adrift in a chest.",
    "When the Egyptians paid more attention to the constellations than they did in the early period of their history, they placed in the constellation of Argo the god Osiris in a chest or boat.",
    "In the Greek period Canopus, the chief star of the constellation of Argo, is the child Horus in his boat.",
    "Horus was a reincarnation of Osiris.",
    "The Babylonian Ea originally came to Eridu in a boat, which became transformed into a fish-man.",
    "As the sign for a god was a star, Ea was apparently supposed to have come from one.",
    "Lockyer refers to Egyptian and Babylonian temples, which were “oriented to Canopus”.",
    "[583] Sun-gods were the offspring of the mother-star, or their own souls were stars by night.",
    "“Hiruko,” says Aston, “is in reality simply a masculine form of Hirume, the sun female.”",
    "[584] The sun and moon had not, however, come into existence when he was set adrift, and it may be that as the “leech-child” he was a star.",
    "He became identified in time with Ebisu (or Yebisu), god of fishermen, and one of the gods of luck.",
    "Izanagi and Izanami had subsequently as children the eight islands of Japan, and although other islands came into existence later, Japan was called “Land-of-the-Eight-great-Islands” (Oho-ya-shima-kuni).",
    "“When,” continues the Ko-ji-ki, “they (Izanagi and Izanami) had finished giving birth to countries they began afresh, giving birth to deities (kami).”",
    "These included “Heavenly-Blowing Male”, “Youth of the Wind”, the sea-kami, “Great-Ocean-Possessor”, “Foam Calm”, “Foam Waves”, “Heavenly-Water-Divider”, or “Water-Distributor” (Ame-no-mi-kumari-no-kami), and the deities of mountains, passes, and valleys.",
    "According to the Nihon-gi, the gods of the sea to whom Izanagi and Izanami gave birth are called Watatsumi, which means “sea children”, or, as Florenz translates it, “Lords of the Sea”.",
    "Wata, so like our “water”, is “an old word for sea”.",
    "It is probable that, as De Visser says, “the old Japanese sea-gods were snakes or dragons”.",
    "[585] In the Ko-ji-ki two groups of eight deities are followed by “the Deity Bird’s-Rock-Camphor-Tree-Boat”, another name for this kami being “Heavenly Bird-Boat”.",
    "Then came the food-goddess, “Deity Princess-of-Great-Food”.",
    "She was followed by the fire-god, kagu-tsuchi.",
    "This deity caused the death of his mother Izanami, having burned her at birth so severely that she sickened and “lay down”.",
    "Before she died, an interesting group of deities, making a total of eight from “Heavenly Bird-Boat” to the last named, “Luxuriant Food Princess”, came into being.",
    "From her vomit sprang “Metal-Mountain Prince” and “Metal-Mountain Princess”; from her fæces came “Clay Prince” and “Clay Princess” (earth deities); and from her urine crept forth Mitsu-ha no-Me, which Japanese commentators explain as “Female-Water-snake”, or “The Woman who produces the Water”.",
    "In the first rendering ha is regarded as meaning “snake” (dragon), and in the second as “to produce”.",
    "Neither Florenz nor De Visser can decide which explanation is correct.",
    "[586] The dragon was, of course, a water-producer, or water-controller, or a “water-confiner”, who was forced to release the waters, like the “drought demon”, slain by the Aryo-Indian god Indra, and the water-confiner of the Nile, whose blood reddened the river during inundation.",
    "When Izanami died, the heart of Izanagi was filled with wrath and grief.",
    "Drawing his big sabre, he, according to the Ko-ji-ki, cut off the head of the fire-god; or, as the Nihon-gi tells, cut him into three pieces, each of which became a god.",
    "Other gods sprang from the pieces, from the blood drops that bespattered the rocks, the blood that clung to the upper part of the sabre, and the blood that leaked out between the fingers of Izanagi.",
    "According to the Nihon-gi, the blood dripping from the upper part of the sword became the gods Kura-okami, Kura-yama-tsumi, and Kura-mitsu-ha.",
    "The meaning of the character kura is “dark”, and Professor Florenz explains it as “abyss, valley, cleft”, [587] and notes that okami means “rain” and “dragon”.",
    "According to De Visser, Kura-okami is a dragon- or snake-god who controls rain and snow, and had Shinto temples “in all provinces”.",
    "Another reading in the Nihon-gi states that one of the three gods who came into being from the pieces of the fire-god’s body was Taka-okami, a name which, according to a Japanese commentator, means “the dragon-god residing on the mountains”, while Kura-okami means “the dragon-god of the valleys”.",
    "[588] The second god born from the blood drops from the upper part of the sword, Kura-yama-tsumi, is translated “Lord of the Dark Mountains”, and “Mountain-snake”; and the third, Kura-mitsu-ha, is “Dark-water-snake” or “Valley-water-snake”.",
    "According to the Ko-ji-ki, the deities Kura-okami and Kura-mitsu-ha came from the blood that leaked out between Izanagi’s fingers.",
    "It is of interest to note here that other dragon deities to which Izanagi and Izanami gave origin, included the mizuchi or “water fathers”, which are referred to as “horned deities”, “four-legged dragons”, or “large water-snakes”.",
    "As Aston notes, [589] these “water fathers” had no individual names; they were prayed to for rain in times of drought.",
    "Another sea-dragon child of the great couple was the wani, which appears to have been a combination of crocodile and shark.",
    "Aston thinks that wani is a Korean word.",
    "De Visser, on the other hand, is of opinion that the wani is the old Japanese dragon-god or sea-god, and",
    "that the legend about the Abundant Pearl Princess (Toyo-tama-bime) [590] who had a human lover and, like Melusina, transformed herself from human shape into that of a wani (Ko-ji-ki) or a dragon (Nihon-gi), was originally a Japanese serpent-dragon, which was “dressed in Indian garb by later generations”.",
    "[591] Florenz, the German Orientalist, thinks the legend is of Chinese origin, but a similar one is found in Indonesia.",
    "“Wani,” De Visser says, “may be an Indonesian word,” and it is possible, as he suggests, that “foreign invaders, who in prehistoric times conquered Japan, came from Indonesia and brought the myth with them.”",
    "[592] There is a reference in the Nihon-gi (Chapter I) to a “bear-wani, eight fathoms long”, and it has been suggested that “bear” means here nothing more than “strong”.",
    "[593] The Ainu, however, as we have seen (Chapter XVII), associated bear and dragon deities; the bear-goddess was the wife of the dragon-god, and that goddess had, like the Abundant Pearl Princess, a human lover.",
    "“Bear-wani” may therefore have been a bear-dragon.",
    "There was a dragon-horse “with a long neck and wings at its sides”, which flew through the air, and did not sink when it trod upon the water, [594] and there were withal Japanese crow-dragons, toad-dragons, fish-dragons, and lizard-dragons.",
    "The horse played as prominent a part in Japanese rain-getting and rain-stopping ceremonies as did the bear among the Ainu.",
    "White, black, or red horses were offered to bring rain, but red horses alone were sacrificed to stop rain.",
    "Like the Buriats of Siberia and the Aryo-Indians of the Vedic period, the Japanese made use of the domesticated horse at the dawn of their history.",
    "No doubt it was imported from Korea.",
    "There is evidence that at an early period human beings were sacrificed to the Japanese dragon-gods of rivers, lakes, and pools.",
    "Human sacrifices at tombs are also referred to.",
    "In the Nihon-gi, under the legendary date 2 B.C., it is related that when a Mikado died his personal attendants were buried alive in an upright position beside his tomb.",
    "[595] In his notable work on the dragon, M. W. de Visser [596] shows that the Chinese ideas regarding their four-legged dragon and Indian Buddhist ideas regarding nagas were introduced into Japan and fused with local ideas regarding serpent-shaped water-gods.",
    "The foreign elements added to ancient Japanese legends have, as has been indicated, made their original form obscure.",
    "In the dragon place-names of Japan, however, it is still possible to trace the locations of the ancient Shinto gods who were mostly serpent-shaped.",
    "An ancient name for a Japanese dragon is Tatsu.",
    "De Visser notes that Tatsu no Kuchi (“Dragon’s mouth”) is a common place-name.",
    "It is given to a hot spring in the Nomi district, to a waterfall in Kojimachi district, to a hill in Kamakura district, where criminals were put to death, and to mountains, &c., elsewhere.",
    "Tatsu ga hana (“Dragon’s nose”) is in Taga district; Tatsukushi (“Dragon’s skewer”) is a rock in Tosa province; and so on.",
    "Chinese and Indian dragons are in Japanese place-names “ryu” or “ryo”.",
    "These include Ryo-ga-mine (“Dragon’s peak”) in Higo; Ryu-ga-take (“Dragon’s peak”) in Ise; Ryu-kan-gawa (“Dragon’s rest river”) in Tokyo, &c.",
    "The worship of the Water Fathers or Dragons in Japan was necessary so as to ensure the food-supply.",

    "After Izanagi had slain his son, the fire-god, and brought into being new gods, including dragons, he was seized with longing to see Izanami once more.",
    "Accordingly he set out to find her in Yomi (“Yellow stream”), the dark Hades of the Underworld.",
    "“The orthodox Japanese derivation of Yomi,” says Chamberlain, “is from yoru, ‘night’, which would give us for Yomo-tsu-kuni some such rendering as ‘Land of Gloom’.”",
    "Another view is that “Yomi” is a mispronunciation of “Yama”, the name of the Aryo-Indian god of death.",
    "[597] When Izanagi reached the gloomy dwelling of his sister, she raised the door, and he spoke to her, saying: “Thine Augustness, my lovely young sister!",
    "the lands that I and you made are not yet finished; so come back”.",
    "She replied out of the darkness: “It is sorrowful that you did not come hither sooner, for I have eaten of the food of Yomi.",
    "Nevertheless, it is my desire to return.",
    "I will therefore speak with the kami of Yomi.”",
    "[598] She added in warning, “Look not at me!”",
    "Izanami then went back to the place she had come from.",
    "She tarried there for so long a time that Izanagi grew impatient.",
    "At length he felt he could not wait any longer, so he broke off the end tooth of his hair-comb, which is called the “male pillar”, and thus made a light, and entered.",
    "[599] He found his sister.",
    "Her body was rotting, and maggots swarmed over it.",
    "The Ko-ji-ki proceeds: “In her head dwelt the Great Thunder, in her breast dwelt the Fire Thunder, in her belly dwelt the Black Thunder, in her private parts dwelt the Cleaving Thunder, in her left hand dwelt the Young Thunder, in her right hand dwelt the Earth Thunder, in her left foot dwelt the Rumbling Thunder, in her right foot dwelt the Couchant Thunder; altogether eight thunder deities had been born and dwelt there.”",
    "Horrified at the spectacle, Izanagi drew back suddenly; whereupon his sister exclaimed, “You have put me to shame!” and became angry.",
    "Here Izanagi has broken a taboo, as did the Japanese youth who married the dragon-maid, Abundant Pearl Princess, and as did the husband of Melusina in the French legend.",
    "It was an ancient custom in Japan to erect “parturition houses”.",
    "These were one-roomed huts to which women retired so as to give birth to children unseen.",
    "Ernest Satow tells that on the island of Hachijo, until comparatively recent times, “women, when about to become mothers, were ... driven out to the huts on the mountain-side, and according to the accounts of native writers, left to shift for themselves, the result not infrequently being the death of the new-born infant”.",
    "[600] It was taboo for a man to enter a “parturition house”.",
    "Apparently Izanami had retired to a “parturition house” in Yomi.",
    "Enraged against Izanagi, because he had put her to shame, Izanami commanded the Ugly Females of Yomi to pursue and slay him.",
    "At this point in the mythical narrative begins a version of the widespread folk-story about the young man who makes escape from his enemy or enemies, and in the course of his flight throws down articles that are transformed into obstacles, or into things which tempt the pursuers to tarry and eat.",
    "[601] The first article that Izanagi cast down behind him was his wreath or head-dress, which was instantly turned into grapes.",
    "This is according to the Ko-ji-ki; the Nihon-gi makes the head-dress the second obstacle.",
    "His pursuer (Ko-ji-ki) or pursuers (Nihon-gi), having devoured the grapes, resumed the chase.",
    "Then Izanagi, as he fled, broke his hair-comb and threw it down; it instantly turned into bamboo sprouts.",
    "While these were being pulled up and eaten, he continued his flight.",
    "The Ko-ji-ki (but not the Nihon-gi) here introduces another set of pursuers.",
    "Izanami, finding that her brother had outwitted the Ugly Female (or Females), “sent the eight Thunder-Deities with a thousand and five hundred warriors of Hades to pursue him.",
    "Izanagi, drawing the ten-grasp sabre that was augustly girded on him, fled forward, brandishing it in his back hand (brandishing it behind him); and as the demons still continued to pursue him, he took, on reaching the base of the Even Pass of Hades, [602] three peaches that were growing at its base, and waited and smote (his pursuers therewith) so that they all fled back.”",
    "[603] Having thus rid himself of his pursuers, Izanagi addressed the peaches, saying: “As you have helped me, so must ye help all living people in the Central Land of Reed-Plains, when they are troubled and harassed”.",
    "Here we have not only a native name of China (“Land of Reed-Plains”) applied to Japan, but also the sacred Chinese peach, a symbol of the Great Mother, the Western Queen of Immortals (Si Wang Fu).",
    "The story of a hero’s flight from the Underworld has not survived in China, if ever it existed there.",
    "It is, however, found in the myths of Scandinavia.",
    "In the Nihon-gi (Aston) the comment is added to the peach incident: “This was the origin of the custom of exorcising evil spirits by means of peaches”.",
    "The peach, like the bean, was in Japan a symbol of the mother-goddess, as was the shell in Egypt and the pig-shell in Greece.",
    "Izanami herself was the last to pursue Izanagi.",
    "When he saw her coming, Izanagi blocked up the Pass of Yomi with a huge boulder of rock, which it would take a thousand men to lift, and he stood on one side of it, while she stood on the other to “exchange leave-takings” (Ko-ji-ki), or to pronounce the formula of divorce (Nihon-gi).",
    "In the Ko-ji-ki Izanami threatens to slay a thousand inhabitants in the land of the living, but Izanagi retorts that he will arrange for the birth of one thousand and five hundred, so that the number born may exceed the number who must die.",
    "Izanami became thereafter Yomo-tsu-oho-kami (Yomi’s Great Deity).",
    "[604] The rock which blocks the Pass of Yomi became the “Great-Deity-of-the-Road-Turning-back”.",
    "In the Nihon-gi (Aston’s translation) it is related that Izanagi flung down various articles on leaving Hades, as the goddess Ishtar in Babylonian mythology flung down her clothing and ornaments on entering the dread abode of Erish-ki-gal (Persephone).",
    "Having pronounced the divorce formula: “He also said, ‘Come no farther’, and threw down his staff, which was called Funando-no-kami (pass-not-place-deity), or Kunado-no-kami (come-not-place-deity).",
    "Moreover, he threw down his girdle, which was called Nagachiha-no-kami.",
    "Moreover, he threw down his upper garment, which was called Wadzurahi-no-kami (god of disease).",
    "Moreover, he threw down his trousers, which were called Aki-guhi-no-kami.",
    "Moreover, he threw down his shoes, which were called Chi-shiki-no-kami.”",
    "On returning to the land of the living, Izanagi exclaimed: “I have come from a hideous and polluted place.",
    "I will therefore perform the purification of my august body.”",
    "He went to bathe at a river mouth on a plain covered with bush-clover, beside a grove of orange trees confronting the sun.",
    "It is here, according to the Ko-ji-ki, that he flings down his staff and the various articles of clothing that are transformed into deities.",
    "Two evil deities were born from the filth of Hades that fell from his person when he entered the water.",
    "He dived, and three sea-gods came into being.",
    "He washed his left eye, and thus gave origin to the goddess of the sun, Ama-terâsu-oho-mi-kami (The Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity).",
    "He washed his right eye, and there came into being the god of the moon, Tsuki-yomi-no-kami (Moon-Night-Possessor).",
    "He washed his nose, and from it was born Take-haya-susa-no-wu-no-mikoto",
    "[605] (His-Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness).",
    "Izanagi took off his necklace of jewels or beads (tama), and, shaking it so that the beads jingled, bestowed it on Ama-terâsu, the sun kami or goddess, and set her to rule the “Plain of High Heaven”.",
    "He commanded the moon-god to rule the night, and Susa-no-wo to rule the “Sea Plain”.",
    "“At this point,” as Chamberlain says, “the story loses its unity.",
    "The moon-goddess is no more heard of, and the traditions concerning the sun-goddess diverge from those concerning the ‘Impetuous-Male-Deity’ in a manner which is productive of inconsistencies in the rest of the mythology.”",
    "[606] Chamberlain translates Susa-no-wo as “Impetuous-Male-Deity”, connecting his name with susama, “to be impetuous”.",
    "But, as Aston points out, the implied noun susa, “impetuosity”, does not exist.",
    "There is, however, a town named Susa in Idzumo, [607] with which area the legends regarding the god are specially associated.",
    "Susa-no-wo may therefore have been simply “the god of Susa”.",
    "Aston, following Dr. Buckley, Chicago, regards him as a personification of the rain-storm.",
    "Japanese writers, on the other hand, have connected him with Godzu Tenno, an Indian Hades deity, and with the moon-god, or regarded him as a war-god, while some European scholars have referred to him as a “rotating-heavens god”.",
    "Having been born from the nose of Izanagi, we should expect Susa-no-wo to have a connection with wind and “the air of life”, as well as with rain and the sea.",
    "It is of special interest to note in this connection that, as Aston says, [608] “Japan is annually visited by destructive typhoons, accompanied by great darkness and a terrific downpour of rain”.",
    "Susa-no-wo is “continually weeping, wailing, and fuming with rage”, and is “a lover of destruction”, and he is associated with Yomi, the habitation of the deities that work evil against mankind.",
    "Susa-no-wo may be the Japanese Indra, who brings rain.",
    "Japanese wind-gods were givers of rain, as well as wind.",
    "[609] Like Indra, Susa-no-wo is a dragon-slayer.",
    "A festival “celebrated in his honour at Onomochi in Bingo” is described by a Japanese writer in these words: [610] “The procession is a tumultuous trial of speed and strength.",
    "Bands of strong men seize the sacred cars, race with them to the sea, and having plunged in breast-deep, their burden held aloft, dash back at full speed to the shrine.",
    "There refreshments are served out, and then the race is resumed, the goal being the central flag among a number set up in a large plain.",
    "Their feet beat time to a wildly shouted chorus, and they sweep along wholly regardless of obstacles or collisions.”",
    "Indra, with Agni, the fire-god, was the winner in a race of the gods; he links with Vayu or Vata, the wind-god, and he wages war against the Danavas, the demons of ocean.",
    "[611] In China dragon-boat races were held so as to cause rain.",
    "Imitation boats were likewise carried through the streets to the seashore, and there burned so as to take away evil influences.",
    "The boats represented fighting dragons, and these were rain-bringers.",
    "The Japanese imitated these Chinese customs, but not, however, until about the eleventh century.",
    "[612] As a trickster among the gods, Susa-no-wo bears some resemblance to the Scandinavian Loki; he is, like that deity, an ally of the powers of darkness and destruction, and he similarly suffers banishment from the celestial land.",
    "Susa-no-wo also recalls Nergal, the Babylonian warrior-god, who conquered Hades, and was “the death spreader” (Mushtabarrû-mûtanu).",
    "The deities of the sun and moon proceeded to rule the day and the night as commanded by their parent Izanagi, but Susa-no-wo did not depart to the ocean, which had been committed to his charge; instead, he cried and wept until his eight-grasp beard reached the pit of his stomach.",
    "Says the Ko-ji-ki: “The fashion of his weeping was such as by his weeping to dry up all the rivers and seas.",
    "For this reason the sound of bad deities was like unto the flies of the fifth moon as they all swarmed, and in all things every portent of woe arose.”",
    "The reference to the god’s tears causing the green mountains to wither and the waters to dry up has greatly perplexed Japanese commentators.",
    "But there are statements in Asian and American mythologies regarding “evil” or “poisonous rain” distributed, to the injury of vegetation, by dragons that may be sick or badly disposed towards mankind.",
    "De Visser refers to a Buddhist legend about a poisonous Naga that guarded a big tree and killed all those who took a branch from it; when angry it sent thunder and rain.",
    "[613] Central Asian legends tell that evil rains were sent out of season by disturbed and enraged dragons.",
    "A Chinese story tells of a sick dragon that, having been roused by prayers, gave “a badly-smelling rain which would have spoiled the crops if a diviner had not discovered it in time and cured the dragon at the latter’s request”.",
    "Thereupon a fertilizing rain fell and a very clear spring dashed forth from a rock.",
    "[614] In Ancient Egypt the deities wept vitalizing tears (see Index).",
    "Ra’s tears gave life to gods and men, the tears of the god Shu and the goddess Tefnut became incense-bearing trees.",
    "The tears of Osiris and Isis caused life-giving herbs, &c., to grow, but the tears shed on the world by the evil Set and his partisans produced poisonous plants.",
    "When deities were enraged, their saliva, sweat, and blood on touching the earth germinated and produced poisonous plants, scorpions, serpents, &c.",
    "[615] The Chinese Buddhists believed in a Naga that, by means of a single drop of water, could give rain to one or two kingdoms, and even prevent the sea from drying up.",
    "[616] Similarly a single tear from Isis-Hathor, as the star Sirius, that fell on the “Night of the Drop”, caused the Nile to rise in flood.",
    "The blighting and ocean-drying tears of Susa-no-wo were evidently those of an evil or angry deity, or of one who was sick with sorrow.",
    "Izanagi, beholding the ocean-ruler in tears, asked him why he wailed and wept.",
    "Susa-no-wo made answer: “I wail because I wish to depart to the land of my dead mother (Izanami) in the Nether-Distant Land (Yomi, i.e. Hades)”.",
    "Izanagi was very angry, and said: “If that be so, you shall not dwell in the ocean domain”.",
    "He then banished Susa-no-wo to Afumi.",
    "[617] Susa-no-wo made answer that he would first take leave of his sister, Ama-terâsu, goddess of the sun.",
    "He rose in the air, as does a thunder-bringing dragon.",
    "Says the Ko-ji-ki: “(With these words) he forthwith went up to Heaven, whereupon all the mountains shook, and every land and country quaked.",
    "So Ama-terâsu, alarmed at the noise, said: ‘The reason of the ascent hither of His Augustness my elder brother [618] is surely no good intent.",
    "It is only that he wishes to wrest my land from me.’”",
    "[619] The goddess unbound her hair, twisted it into bunches, put on her string of five hundred curved jewels (maga-tama, i.e. claw-shaped),",
    "[620] and armed herself with bow and arrows.",
    "She stood “valiantly like unto a mighty man”, and asked her brother why he had ascended.",
    "Susa-no-wo declared he had no evil intention, and she asked him to give proof of his sincerity and goodwill.",
    "He proposed that they should pledge their faith and produce children.",
    "To this she consented, and they “swore to each other from the opposite banks of the Tranquil River of Heaven”.",
    "[621] Ama-terâsu asked Susa-no-wo for his sword.",
    "He gave it to her and she broke it into three pieces.",
    "She then made a jingling sound with her jewels, brandished and washed them in the True-Pool-Well of Heaven",
    "[622] and “crunchingly crunched them”.",
    "Then from the mist (of her breath) were born the deities Torrent-Mist-Princess, Lovely-Island-Princess, and Princess-of-the-Torrent.",
    "Susa-no-wo then asked for and obtained from Ama-terâsu the string of five hundred curved jewels",
    "[623] which was twisted in the left bunch of her hair.",
    "He made a jingling sound with the jewels, washed them in the Pool, and, having crunched them, “blew them away”.",
    "From his breath were born the god “Truly-Conqueror-I-Conquer-Conquering-Swift-Heavenly-Great-Great-Ears”, the god Ame-no-hohi, [624] the god “Prince-Lord of Heaven”, the god “Prince-Lord of Life”, and the god of Kumano.",
    "In all eight deities—three goddesses and five gods—were born.",
    "From these deities the Japanese noble families have claimed descent.",
    "The Mikados were supposed to be descended from the Conquering God with Great Ears (Masa-ya-a-katsu-kachi-haya-hi-ama-no-oshi-ho-mi-mi).",
    "Another myth makes the Mikado a descendant of the sun-goddess and Taka-mi-musubi (the High, August God of Birth and Growth), who, in a sense, is a Japanese Osiris.",
    "He has been compared to the Hindu god Shiva.",
    "Aston says that “musubi” is “the abstract process of growth personified—that is, a power immanent in nature and not external to it”.",
    "[625] Breasted similarly regards Osiris as “the imperishable principle of life wherever found”.",
    "[626] Shiva, as “the fructifying principle”, is represented by the phallus.",
    "It is believed that this symbol was the “shintai” (god body) of Musubi.",
    "[627] After the three goddesses and five gods had come into being, Susa-no-wo declared, “I have undoubtedly gained the victory”.",
    "He then proceeded to harry the celestial regions.",
    "He broke down the divisions of the rice-fields, filled up the ditches, and fouled with excrement and urine the palace in which the goddess took food.",
    "He became even more violent.",
    "Having broken open a hole in the sacred house in which sat Ama-terâsu superintending the weaving of the garments of deities, he let fall into it a heavenly piebald horse that had been flayed backwards (a criminal offence).",
    "The celestial female weavers were terrified.",
    "Alarmed by Susa-no-wo’s doings, the sun-goddess entered her cave, the Heavenly Rock Dwelling, [628] shut the door and made it fast.",
    "All the land became dark.",
    "Then the eight hundred myriad deities took counsel, sitting in the bed of the River of Heaven, so as to plan how they could entice the sun-goddess from her hiding-place.",
    "They made the cocks (“the long-singing birds of eternal night”) to crow loud, they caused the Heavenly Smith to shape a mirror of iron (the “true metal”) from the Heavenly Metal-Mountains (the mines), and charged the Jewel-Ancestor (Tama-noya-no-mikoto) to make a complete string of five hundred curved jewels.",
    "A tree was then taken from the celestial Mount Kagu",
    "[629] and on it were hung the mirror, the jewel, cherry bark, and other offerings.",
    "The ritual was recited, and thereafter Ama-no-Uzume (the Dread Celestial Female), wearing metal head-gear (flowers of gold and silver) and a sash of club-moss from the celestial mountain, and holding in her hands a posy of bamboo grass, danced on a tub",
    "[630] until the eight hundred myriad deities laughed.",
    "Wondering to hear sounds of merriment, instead of sounds of woe, the sun-goddess opened the door of her cave a little and asked why they all laughed.",
    "She was told that the deities rejoiced because they had among them a more august goddess than herself.",
    "One of the gods then held up the mirror, and the sun-goddess was astonished to behold a bright deity, not knowing it was her reflected image, and gradually came forth, fascinated by her own beauty and brightness.",
    "A strong deity took her hand and drew her out while another deity, Grand Jewel, drew a straw rope behind her so as to prevent her retreating.",
    "[631] In this manner the sun-goddess was enticed to return and light up the world.",
    "The second expulsion of Susa-no-wo followed.",
    "He was fined an immense fine of table-offerings, his beard was shorn, and his finger and toe nails were drawn out.",
    "According to the Ko-ji-ki, he begged for food from the food-goddess.",
    "She took “dainty things” from various parts of her body which he regarded as filth, so he slew her.",
    "Then from her head “were born silk-worms, in her two eyes were born rice-seeds, in her two ears were born millet, in her nose were born small beans, in her private parts were born barley, in her fundament were born large beans”.",
    "These were used as seeds.",
    "According to the Nihon-gi, they were sown “in the narrow fields and in the long fields of Heaven”.",
    "The reason for keeping the mirror and jewels (tama) in the shrine of Ise, and for worshipping the sun-goddess and the food-goddess there, are thus explained in Shinto mythology.",
    "Virgin priestesses danced at religious ceremonies as did the tub-thumping goddess, and offerings were suspended from trees as in the celestial regions, while the straw rope was utilized to keep back demons and to ensure the rising of the sun by preventing the retreat of the sun-goddess.",

    "After Susa-no-wo had been banished from heaven, he descended on Tori-kami, beside the river Hi, in the province of Idzumo.",
    "A chopstick came floating down the river, so he knew that people were dwelling near, and he set out to search for them.",
    "He soon met an old man and an old woman who were weeping bitterly; between them walked a lovely maiden.",
    "“Who are you?” asked Susa-no-wo.",
    "The old man made answer: “I am a god of earth, son of a mountain god, and my name is Ashi-na-dzu-chi (‘foot-stroker’); this woman is my wife, and her name is Te-na-dzu-chi (‘hand stroker’); the maiden is my daughter Kush-inada-hime (‘Miraculous-rice-field-sun-maiden’).”",
    "“Why do you weep?” asked Susa-no-wo.",
    "Said the old man: “I have had eight daughters, but each year the eight-forked serpent (dragon) of Koshi has come and devoured one after the other.",
    "I weep now because the time is at hand to give Kush-inada-hime to the serpent.”",
    "“What is the serpent like?”",
    "“Its eyes are red as the winter cherry [632]; it has a body with eight heads and eight tails, and on its body grow moss and trees.",
    "It is so long that it stretches over eight valleys and eight hills.",
    "Its belly is constantly bloody and inflamed.”",
    "[633] “If this maiden is your daughter,” said Susa-no-wo, “will you give her to me?”",
    "“You honour me,” the old man made answer, “but I do not know your name.”",
    "“I am the dear brother of the sun-goddess, and have just descended from heaven.”",
    "“Most obediently do I offer my daughter to you,” the old man said with reverence.",
    "Susa-no-wo then transformed the girl into a comb, which he placed in his hair.",
    "Having done this, he bade the old couple to brew rice-beer (sake).",
    "They obeyed him, and he asked them to construct a fence with eight gates and eight benches, and to place on each bench a vat filled with the beer.",
    "In time the eight-forked serpent came nigh.",
    "It dipped each of its heads into each of the vats, drank the sake, became drunk, and then lay down and slept.",
    "Susa-no-wo drew his two-handed sword, [634] and cut the serpent in pieces.",
    "The Hi River turned red with blood.",
    "When Susa-no-wo cut the middle tail his sword broke.",
    "He marvelled at this.",
    "Taking the point of the sword in his hand, he thrust and split, and looked inside, and found a keen-cutting blade within this tail.",
    "He took it out and sent it to his sister, Ama-terâsu, the sun-goddess.",
    "This sword is the Kusa-nagi-no-tachi (the “herb-quelling” dragon-sword).",
    "Susa-no-wo afterwards built a house in the land of Idzumo, at a place called Suga.",
    "Clouds rose up from that place.",
    "He made an ode regarding the eight clouds that formed an eight-fold fence for husband and wife to retire within the house.",
    "Then he appointed the maiden’s father to be keeper, or head-man of the house.",
    "In this nuptial house children were born to Susa-no-wo and the young woman he had rescued from the dragon.",
    "These children included Oho-toshi-no-kami (Great Harvest deity), Uka-no-mitama (the August Spirit of Food), and Ohonamochi (“Great Name Possessor”), the god of Idzumo, [635] who could assume snake form or human form at will.",
    "Ohonamochi and his eighty brothers desired to marry the Princess of Yakami in Inaba.",
    "On their way thither the eighty brothers tricked a hare, which came by a distressing injury, but Ohonamochi caused it to be cured.",
    "The grateful hare of Inaba, now called “the Hare Deity”, promised Ohonamochi, who carried the bag as a servant to his brothers, that he would get the princess for wife.",
    "The princess afterwards refused to marry any of the eighty brothers, saying she favoured Ohonamochi.",
    "Being enraged, the brothers took counsel together and said to Ohonamochi: “There is a red boar on this mountain, named Tema, in the land of Hataki.",
    "When we drive it down, you must catch it.",
    "If you fail to catch it, we shall certainly slay you.”",
    "[636] Having thus spoken, the eighty deities kindled a fire, in which they heated a great boulder, shaped like to a boar.",
    "They rolled the stone down the mountain-side, and when Ohonamochi seized it he was so grievously burned that he died.",
    "Then his mother wept and lamented, and ascending to heaven, appealed to Kami-musu-bi-no-kami (Divine-Producing Wondrous-Deity), one of the elder gods, [637] who sent Kisa-gahi-hime (Princess Cockle-Shell)",
    "[638] and Umugi-hime (Princess Clam)",
    "[639] to restore the dead deity to life.",
    "Kisa-gahi-hime “triturated and scorched her shell”, and Umugi-hime “carried water and smeared him as with mother’s milk”.",
    "[640] Thereupon Ohonamochi came to life as a beautiful young man and walked again.",
    "The eighty deities again deceived Ohonamochi.",
    "They led him to the mountains.",
    "There they cut down a tree, which they split, inserting a wedge in it, and having made him stand in the middle, they took away the wedge, and thus killed him.",
    "Ohonamochi’s mother again wailed and wept.",
    "She cut the tree, and, taking him out, restored him to life once more.",
    "Then he fled to the Land of Trees, escaping from his pursuers, who had fixed arrows in their bows, by dipping under the fork of a tree and disappearing.",
    "[641] Ohonamochi was advised to seek refuge in the Nether-Distant-Land (Hades), where dwelt Susa-no-wo.",
    "Princess Forward met him, and they exchanged glances, and were married.",
    "She then informed her father, Susa-no-wo, that a very beautiful god had arrived.",
    "But Susa-no-wo was angry, and called the youthful deity “Ugly-Male-God-of-Reed-Plain”, and commanded him to sleep in the snake-house.",
    "The Princess Forward gave Ohonamochi a snake-scarf, instructing him to wave it thrice when the snakes threatened to bite him.",
    "This he did, and was protected.",
    "On the next night Susa-no-wo placed the young god in the house of centipedes and wasps, but the princess gave him another scarf that protected him against attack.",
    "Next day Susa-no-wo shot a “humming arrow”",
    "[642] into the middle of a moor, and made Ohonamochi fetch it back.",
    "But when the young god went out on the moor Susa-no-wo set fire to it all round.",
    "Ohonamochi could perceive no way of escape.",
    "As he stood there, a mouse",
    "[643] came and told him of a hollow place in which he could shelter himself.",
    "Ohonamochi hastened to the hole and hid in it till the fire had gone past.",
    "Then the mouse discovered and brought the humming arrow to Ohonamochi.",
    "“The feathers of the arrows were brought in their mouths by all the mouse’s children” (Ko-ji-ki, p. 73).",
    "[644] Princess Forward lamented for her husband, and Susa-no-wo believed he was dead.",
    "But the princess found Ohonamochi, and took him to the house.",
    "He returned the arrow to Susa-no-wo.",
    "This god had many centipedes in his hair, and bade the youth take them out.",
    "Ohonamochi made pretence of doing this, and Susa-no-wo fell asleep.",
    "Then Ohonamochi tied the hair of Susa-no-wo to the rafters, placed a great boulder against the door, and fled away with Princess Forward on his back.",
    "He carried away, too, Susa-no-wo’s life-sword and life-bow and arrows, and the heavenly-speaking lute.",
    "[645] As Ohonamochi fled, the lute touched a tree, and the earth resounded with its call.",
    "Susa-no-wo was awakened by the spirit-call.",
    "He pulled down the great house so as to get out, but was so long delayed in disentangling his hair from the rafters, that when he went in pursuit he did not get within call of Ohonamochi until he reached the Even Pass of Yomi (Hades).",
    "[646] Susa-no-wo shouted to Ohonamochi, advising him to pursue the eighty half-brothers with the life-sword and life-bow and arrows until they were swept into the river rapids.",
    "“Then, wretch,” said he, “become Oho-kuni-nushi (Great Master god of the land), and make Princess Forward thy consort.",
    "Set up the temple-pillars at the foot of Mount Uka on foundations of rock and raise the cross-beams to the Plain of High Heaven.",
    "Dwell there, you villain.”",
    "Ohonamochi pursued and destroyed the eighty deities.",
    "“Then,” the narrative continues, “he began to make the land.”",
    "Here we meet with another Creation myth.",
    "Two children were born to Ohonamochi and Princess Forward; these were Ki-no-mata-no-kami (Tree-fork-deity) and Mi-wi-no-kami (Deity of August Wells).",
    "Like Odin, Ohonamochi woos in the course of his career more than one goddess.",
    "One of these, the Princess of Nuna-kaha (Lagoon-river), sings to him: “Being a man probably (thou) hast on the various island headlands that thou seest, and on every beach headland that thou lookest on, a wife like the young herbs.",
    "But as for me, alas! being a woman, I have no man except thee.”",
    "[647] An elfin deity comes across the ocean to assist Ohonamochi to “make and consolidate the land”.",
    "He is named Sukuna-bikona (the Little Prince god).",
    "Attired in bird",
    "[648] skins, the little god sailed in a boat of the heavenly Kagami.",
    "[649] After Little Prince had for a time assisted to consolidate the land, he crossed over to Toko-yo-no-kuni (the Eternal Land).",
    "Then came a deity illuminating the sea to assist in consolidating the land.",
    "He asked for a temple on Mount Mimoro and was afterwards worshipped there.",
    "He himself passed to the Eternal Land (Toko-yo-no-kuni), where grows the orange tree of life.",
    "[650] The deity there who revealed Little Prince is called Crumbling Prince; his legs do not walk, but he knows everything beneath the Heavens.",

    "It was Hohodemi who wooed and wed the “Abundant Pearl Princess” and lived with her for a time in the land under the ocean.",

    "He possessed a magic celestial cross-sword and a fire-striker.",

    "Then Tajima-mori set apart of club-moss four and of spears four, which he presented to the Great Empress, and set up of club-moss four and of spears four as an offering at the door of the Heavenly Sovereign’s august mausoleum, and, raising on high the fruit of the tree, wailed and wept, saying: ‘Bringing the fruit of the Everlasting Fragrant Tree from the Eternal Land, I have come to serve thee.’",

    "This fruit of the Everlasting Fragrant Tree is what is now called the orange.”",
    "Chamberlain explains [655] that “club-moss oranges” signifies oranges as they grow on the branch surrounded by leaves, while spear-oranges are the same divested of leaves and hanging to the bare twig.",
    "The location of the Eternal Land has greatly puzzled native scholars.",
    "Some suppose it was a part of Korea and others that it was Southern China or the Loocho Islands.",
    "According to the Nihon-gi, Tajima-mori found the Eternal Land to be inhabited by gods and dwarfs.",
    "As it lay somewhere to the west of Japan, it would appear to be identical with the Western Paradise which, according to Chinese belief, is ruled over by Si Wang Mu (the Japanese Seiobo), the “Royal Mother” and “Queen of Immortals”.",
    "Instead of the Chinese Peach Tree of Life, the Japanese had in their own Western Paradise the Orange Tree of Life.",
    "The orange was not, however, introduced into Japan until the eighth century of our era.",
    "[656] Whether or not it supplanted in the Japanese paradise an earlier tree, as the cassia tree supplanted the peach tree in the Chinese paradise, is at present uncertain.",
    "It may be that the idea of the Western Paradise was introduced by the Buddhists.",
    "At the same time, it will be recalled that the Peach Tree of Life grew on the borderland of Yomi, which was visited by Izanagi.",
    "A similar garden paradise was known to the Polynesians, and especially the Tahitians.",
    "It was called Rohutu noanoa (“Perfumed or Fragrant Rohutu”).",
    "Thither the souls of the dead were conducted by the god Urutaetae.",
    "This paradise “was supposed”, writes Ellis, [657] “to be near a lofty and stupendous mountain in Raiatea, situated in the vicinity of Hamaniino harbour and called Temehani unauna, ‘splendid or glorious Temehani’.",
    "It was, however, said to be invisible to mortal eyes, being in the reva, or aerial regions.",
    "The country was described as most lovely and enchanting in appearance, adorned with flowers of every form and hue, and perfumed with odours of every fragrance.",
    "The air was free from every noxious vapour, pure, and most salubrious....",
    "Rich viands and delicious fruits were supposed to be furnished in abundance for the frequent and sumptuous festivals celebrated there.",
    "Handsome youths and women, purotu anae, all perfection, thronged the place.”",
    "Another Polynesian paradise, called Pulotu, was reserved for chiefs, who obtained “plenty of the best food and other indulgences”.",
    "Its ruler, Saveasiuleo, had a human head.",
    "The upper part of his body reclined in a great house “in company with the spirits of departed chiefs”, while “the extremity of his body was said to stretch away into the sea in the shape of an eel or serpent”.",
    "[658] The Japanese had thus, like the Polynesians, a garden paradise and a sea-dragon-king’s paradise, as well as the gloomy Yomi.",
    "It may be that the beliefs and stories regarding these Otherworlds were introduced by the earliest seafarers, who formed pearl-fishing communities round their shores.",
    "The Ainu believe that Heaven and Hell are beneath the earth, “in Pokna moshiri, the lower world”, but they have no idea what the rewards of the righteous are.",
    "[659] Nothing is definitely known regarding the beliefs of the earlier and more highly civilized people remembered as the Koro-pok-guru.",
    "The Mikado Sui-nin was succeeded by the Mikado Kei-ko, who died in A.D. 130, aged 143 years.",
    "One of his sons, Yamato-Take, is a famous legendary hero of Japan.",
    "He performed many heroic deeds in battle against brigands and rebels.",
    "At Ise he obtained from his aunt, Yamato-hime, the priestess, the famous Kusanagi sword, and a bag which he was not to open except when in peril of his life.",
    "He then set out to subdue and pacify all savage deities and unsubmissive peoples.",
    "The ruler of Sagami set fire to a moor which Yamato entered in quest of a “Violent Deity”.",
    "Finding himself in peril, he opened the bag and discovered in it a fire-striker (or fire-drill).",
    "He mowed the herbage with the dragon-sword, and, using the fire-striker, kindled a counter-fire, which drove back the other fire.",
    "The Kusanagi (herb-quelling) sword takes its name from this incident.",
    "Yamato-Take afterwards slew the wicked rulers of that land.",
    "He also slew a god in the shape of a white deer which met him in Ashigara Pass.",
    "He lay in ambush, and with a scrap of chive [660] hit the deer in the eye and thus struck it dead.",
    "Then he shouted three times “Adzuma ha ya” (Oh, my wife!).",
    "The land was thereupon called Adzuma.",
    "Then follows the mysterious story of the death of the hero.",
    "He went to the land of Shinanu, in which Ohonamochi had taken refuge when Japan was being subdued for the ruler chosen by the sun-goddess, and where, being pursued and threatened with death, Ohonamochi consented to abdicate and take up his abode in a temple.",
    "The country takes its name from shina, a tree resembling the lime, [661] and nu or no, “moor”.",
    "Yamato-Take entered this land through Shinanu Pass (Shinanu no saka), between the provinces of Shinano and Mino.",
    "He overcame the deity of the pass, and went to dwell in the house of Princess Miyazu, of fragrant and slender arms.",
    "She welcomed him with love.",
    "In the house of the princess he left the Kusanagi sword, and went forth against the deity of evil breath (or influence) on Mount Ibuki.",
    "As he climbed the mountain he met a white boar, big as a bull.",
    "Believing it was a messenger of the deity, he vowed he would slay it when he returned, and continued to climb the mountain.",
    "But the boar was not a messenger; it was the very deity in person, and it sent a heavy ice-rain.",
    "[662] The rain-smitten and perplexed hero was thus misled by the deity.",
    "On descending the mountain, Yamato-Take reached the fresh spring of Tama-kura-be (the “Jewel-store-tribe”).",
    "He drank from it, and revived somewhat.",
    "The spring was afterwards called Wi-same (the “well of awakening” or “resting”).",
    "Then Yamato-Take departed, and reached the moor of Tagi, [663] lamenting the loss of bodily strength.",
    "He passed on to Cape Wotsu in Ise, and there found a sword he had left at a pine tree, and sang: “O pine tree, my brother, If thou wert a person, My sword and my garments To thee would I give”.",
    "Having sung this song, he proceeded on his way, yearning for his native land, delightful Yamato, situated behind Mount Awogaki.",
    "His next song was one of love and regret.",
    "“How sweet o’er the skies From Yamato, my home, Do its white clouds arise, Do its white clouds all come.”",
    "His sickness and weariness made him feel more and more faint, and he sang in his distress: “Oh!",
    "the sharp sabre-sword I left by the bedside Of Princess Miyazu— The sabre-sword”.",
    "[664] Yamato-Take sank and died as soon as he had finished his song.",
    "In time his wives came and built for him a mausoleum, weeping and moaning the while, because he could not hear them or make answer.",
    "Then Yamato-Take was transformed into a white bird, [665] which rose high in the air and flew towards the shore.",
    "The wives pursued the bird with lamentations and entered the sea.",
    "They saw the bird flying towards the beach, and followed it.",
    "For a time it perched on a rock.",
    "Then it flew from Ise to Shiki, in the land of Kafuchi, where a mausoleum was built for it, so that it might rest.",
    "[666] But the white bird rose again to heaven and flew away.",
    "It was never again seen.",
    "After Mikado Kei-ko, father of Yamato-Take, had passed away, Sei-mu reigned until he was 108 years old.",
    "Then followed the Mikado Chiu-ai.",
    "His capital was in the south-west on the island of Kyushu.",
    "A message came from the goddess through the Empress Jingo, who was divinely possessed, promising him Korea, “a land to the westward” with “abundance of various treasures, dazzling to the eye, from gold and silver downwards”.",
    "The Mikado refused to believe there was a land to the west, and declared that the gods spoke falsely.",
    "Soon afterwards the heavenly sovereign was struck dead.",
    "Now the Empress Jingo was with child.",
    "Having received the instructions of the deities to conquer Korea for her son, she delayed his birth by taking a stone and attaching it to her waist with cords.",
    "Korea was subdued, the Empress having made use of the “Jewels of flood and ebb”, as related in a previous chapter.",
    "Her child was born after she returned to Japan.",
    "Empress Jingo is further credited with subduing and uniting the Empire of Japan, and again establishing the central power at Yamato.",
    "She lived until she was 100 years old.",
    "Her son Ojin Tenno, [667] who had a dragon’s tail, lived until he was 110 years old, and died in A.D. 310.",
    "He was worshipped after death as a war-god, and the patron of the Minamoto clan.",
    "His successor, Nin-toku, who died at the age of 110, was the last of the mythical monarchs, or of the monarchs regarding whom miraculous deeds are related.",
    "Japanese history begins and myth ends about the beginning of the fifth century of the Christian era.",
    "The cult of Hachiman (Ojin Tenno) came into prominence in the ninth century with the rise of the Minamoto family; its original seat was Usa, in Buzen province.",
    "Hachiman’s shintai (“god body”) is a white stone, or a fly-brush, or a pillow, or an arm-rest.",
    "Jimmu Tenno, the Empress Jingo, and Yamato-Take were similarly deified and worshipped.",
    "A ninth century scholar, Sugahara Michizane, was deified as Temmangû, god of scholars.",
    "Living as well as dead Mikados were kami (deities).",
    "“The spirits of all the soldiers who died in battle,” writes Yei Ozaki, [668] “are worshipped as deified heroes at the Kudan shrine in Tokyo.”",
    "The worship of human ancestors in Japan is due to Chinese influence, and had no place in old Shinto prior to the sixth century.",
    "In the Ko-ji-ki and Nihon-gi the ancestors of the Mikados and the ruling classes are the deities and their avatars.",
    "As we have seen, the Mikados were reputed to be descended from the sun-goddess, and from the daughter of the Dragon King of Ocean, called the “Abundant-Pearl Princess”, a Japanese Melusina.",
    "It is far from correct, therefore, to refer, as has been done, to Shinto religion as “the worship of nature-gods and ancestors”.",
    "Even the term “nature-worship” is misleading.",
    "The adoration in sacred shrines of the mi-tama (the “August jewel”, or “Dragon-pearl”, or “spirit”, or “double”) of a deity is not “the worship of Nature”, but the worship of “the imperishable principle of life wherever found”.",
    "At Ise, the “Mecca” of Japan, the goddess cult is prominent.",
    "Both the sun-goddess and the food-goddess are forms of the Far Eastern Hathor, the personification of the pearl, the shell, the precious jewel containing “life substance”, the sun mirror, the sword, the pillow, the standing-stone, the holy tree, the medicinal herb, the fertilizing rain, &c.",
    "The Mikado, as her descendant, was the living Horus, an avatar of Osiris; after death the Mikado ascended, like Ra, to the celestial regions, or departed, like Osiris, to the Underworld of the Dead.",
    "The Mikado of Japan, like the Pharaoh of Egypt, was a Son of Heaven.",
    "After Buddhism had been introduced into Japan in the sixth century, it was fused with Shinto.",
    "The Shinto deities figured as avatars of Buddha in the cult of Ryobu-Shinto.",
    "Even the Mikados came under the spell of Buddhism.",
    "In the eighteenth century began the movement known as the “Revival of Pure Shinto”.",
    "It was promoted chiefly by Motöori and his disciple Hirata.",
    "In time it did much to bring about the revolution which restored to supreme political power, as the hereditary high priest and living representative of the sun-goddess, the Mikado of Japan.",
    "Shinto is the official religion of modern Japan; but Buddhism, impregnated with Shinto elements, is the religion of the masses.",
    "“Pure Shinto”, however, was not “pure” in the sense that Motöori and Hirata professed to believe.",
    "It was undoubtedly a product of culture mixing in early times.",
    "“The Ko-ji-ki and Nihon-gi,” as Laufer says, “do not present a pure source of genuine Japanese thought, but are retrospective records largely written under Chinese and Korean influence, and echoing in a bewildering medley continental-Asiatic and Malayo-Polynesian traditions.”",
    "[669] In China, Korea, Polynesia, &c., a similar process of culture mixing can be traced.",
    "Buddha and Mohammed were not the earliest founders of cults which have left their impress on the religious systems of the Far East.",
    "Vast areas were influenced by the cultures of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia.",
    "The history of civilization does not support the hypothesis that the same myths and religious practices were of spontaneous generation in widely-separated countries.",
    "Culture complexes cannot be accounted for or explained away by the application of the principles of biological evolution.",
    "As has been shown in these pages, there are many culture complexes in China and Japan, and many links with more ancient civilizations.",
    "Touching on the problem of culture mixing in China, Laufer writes: “In opposition to the prevalent opinion of the day, it cannot be emphasized strongly enough on every occasion that Chinese civilization, as it appears now, is not a unit and not the exclusive production of the Chinese, but the final result of the cultural efforts of a vast conglomeration of the most varied tribes, an amalgamation of ideas accumulated from manifold quarters and widely differentiated in space and time; briefly stated, this means China is not a nation, but an empire, a political, but not an ethnical unit.",
    "No graver error can hence be committed than to attribute any culture idea at the outset to the Chinese, for no other reason than because it appears within the precincts of their empire.”",

    "Y. T. O. Tokio, 1908.",
    "PREFACE",
    "This collection of Japanese fairy tales is the outcome of a suggestion made to me indirectly through a friend by Mr. Andrew Lang.",
    "They have been translated from the modern version written by Sadanami Sanjin.",
    "These stories are not literal translations, and though the Japanese story and all quaint Japanese expressions have been faithfully preserved, they have been told more with the view to interest young readers of the West than the technical student of folk-lore.",
    "Grateful acknowledgment is due to Mr. Y. Yasuoka, Miss Fusa Okamoto, my brother Nobumori Ozaki, Dr. Yoshihiro Takaki, and Miss Kameko Yamao, who have helped me with translations.",
    "The story which I have named “The Story of the Man who did not Wish to Die” is taken from a little book written a hundred years ago by one Shinsui Tamenaga.",
    "It is named Chosei Furo, or “Longevity.”",
    "“The Bamboo-cutter and the Moon-child” is taken from the classic “Taketari Monogatari,” and is NOT classed by the Japanese among their fairy tales, though it really belongs to this class of literature.",
    "The pictures were drawn by Mr. Kakuzo Fujiyama, a Tokio artist.",
    "In telling these stories in English I have followed my fancy in adding such touches of local color or description as they seemed to need or as pleased me, and in one or two instances I have gathered in an incident from another version.",
    "At all times, among my friends, both young and old, English or American, I have always found eager listeners to the beautiful legends and fairy tales of Japan, and in telling them I have also found that they were still unknown to the vast majority, and this has encouraged me to write them for the children of the West.",
    "Y. T. O. Tokio, 1908.",
    "JAPANESE FAIRY TALES MY LORD BAG OF RICE Long, long ago there lived, in Japan a brave warrior known to all as Tawara Toda, or “My Lord Bag of Rice.”",
    "His true name was Fujiwara Hidesato, and there is a very interesting story of how he came to change his name.",
    "One day he sallied forth in search of adventures, for he had the nature of a warrior and could not bear to be idle.",
    "So he buckled on his two swords, took his huge bow, much taller than himself, in his hand, and slinging his quiver on his back started out.",
    "He had not gone far when he came to the bridge of Seta-no-Karashi spanning one end of the beautiful Lake Biwa.",
    "No sooner had he set foot on the bridge than he saw lying right across his path a huge serpent-dragon.",
    "Its body was so big that it looked like the trunk of a large pine tree and it took up the whole width of the bridge.",
    "One of its huge claws rested on the parapet of one side of the bridge, while its tail lay right against the other.",
    "The monster seemed to be asleep, and as it breathed, fire and smoke came out of its nostrils.",
    "At first Hidesato could not help feeling alarmed at the sight of this horrible reptile lying in his path, for he must either turn back or walk right over its body.",
    "He was a brave man, however, and putting aside all fear went forward dauntlessly.",
    "Crunch, crunch!",
    "he stepped now on the dragon’s body, now between its coils, and without even one glance backward he went on his way.",
    "He had only gone a few steps when he heard some one calling him from behind.",
    "On turning back he was much surprised to see that the monster dragon had entirely disappeared and in its place was a strange-looking man, who was bowing most ceremoniously to the ground.",
    "His red hair streamed over his shoulders and was surmounted by a crown in the shape of a dragon’s head, and his sea-green dress was patterned with shells.",
    "Hidesato knew at once that this was no ordinary mortal and he wondered much at the strange occurrence.",
    "Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time?",
    "Or had it transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean?",
    "While these thoughts passed through his mind he had come up to the man on the bridge and now addressed him: “Was it you that called me just now?”",
    "“Yes, it was I,” answered the man: “I have an earnest request to make to you.",
    "Do you think you can grant it to me?”",
    "“If it is in my power to do so I will,” answered Hidesato, “but first tell me who you are?”",
    "“I am the Dragon King of the Lake, and my home is in these waters just under this bridge.”",
    "“And what is it you have to ask of me?” said Hidesato.",
    "“I want you to kill my mortal enemy the centipede, who lives on the mountain beyond,” and the Dragon King pointed to a high peak on the opposite shore of the lake.",
    "“I have lived now for many years in this lake and I have a large family of children and grand-children.",
    "For some time past we have lived in terror, for a monster centipede has discovered our home, and night after night it comes and carries off one of my family.",
    "I am powerless to save them.",
    "If it goes on much longer like this, not only shall I lose all my children, but I myself must fall a victim to the monster.",
    "I am, therefore, very unhappy, and in my extremity I determined to ask the help of a human being.",
    "For many days with this intention I have waited on the bridge in the shape of the horrible serpent-dragon that you saw, in the hope that some strong brave man would come along.",
    "But all who came this way, as soon as they saw me were terrified and ran away as fast as they could.",
    "You are the first man I have found able to look at me without fear, so I knew at once that you were a man of great courage.",
    "I beg you to have pity upon me.",
    "Will you not help me and kill my enemy the centipede?”",
    "Hidesato felt very sorry for the Dragon King on hearing his story, and readily promised to do what he could to help him.",
    "The warrior asked where the centipede lived, so that he might attack the creature at once.",
    "The Dragon King replied that its home was on the mountain Mikami, but that as it came every night at a certain hour to the palace of the lake, it would be better to wait till then.",
    "So Hidesato was conducted to the palace of the Dragon King, under the bridge.",
    "Strange to say, as he followed his host downwards the waters parted to let them pass, and his clothes did not even feel damp as he passed through the flood.",
    "Never had Hidesato seen anything so beautiful as this palace built of white marble beneath the lake.",
    "He had often heard of the Sea King’s palace at the bottom of the sea, where all the servants and retainers were salt-water fishes, but here was a magnificent building in the heart of Lake Biwa.",
    "The dainty goldfishes, red carp, and silvery trout, waited upon the Dragon King and his guest.",
    "Hidesato was astonished at the feast that was spread for him.",
    "The dishes were crystallized lotus leaves and flowers, and the chopsticks were of the rarest ebony.",
    "As soon as they sat down, the sliding doors opened and ten lovely goldfish dancers came out, and behind them followed ten red-carp musicians with the koto and the samisen.",
    "Thus the hours flew by till midnight, and the beautiful music and dancing had banished all thoughts of the centipede.",
    "The Dragon King was about to pledge the warrior in a fresh cup of wine when the palace was suddenly shaken by a tramp, tramp!",
    "as if a mighty army had begun to march not far away.",
    "Hidesato and his host both rose to their feet and rushed to the balcony, and the warrior saw on the opposite mountain two great balls of glowing fire coming nearer and nearer.",
    "The Dragon King stood by the warrior’s side trembling with fear.",
    "“The centipede!",
    "The centipede!",
    "Those two balls of fire are its eyes.",
    "It is coming for its prey!",
    "Now is the time to kill it.”",
    "Hidesato looked where his host pointed, and, in the dim light of the starlit evening, behind the two balls of fire he saw the long body of an enormous centipede winding round the mountains, and the light in its hundred feet glowed like so many distant lanterns moving slowly towards the shore.",
    "Hidesato showed not the least sign of fear.",
    "He tried to calm the Dragon King.",
    "“Don’t be afraid.",
    "I shall surely kill the centipede.",
    "Just bring me my bow and arrows.”",
    "The Dragon King did as he was bid, and the warrior noticed that he had only three arrows left in his quiver.",
    "He took the bow, and fitting an arrow to the notch, took careful aim and let fly.",
    "The arrow hit the centipede right in the middle of its head, but instead of penetrating, it glanced off harmless and fell to the ground.",
    "Nothing daunted, Hidesato took another arrow, fitted it to the notch of the bow and let fly.",
    "Again the arrow hit the mark, it struck the centipede right in the middle of its head, only to glance off and fall to the ground.",
    "The centipede was invulnerable to weapons!",
    "When the Dragon King saw that even this brave warrior’s arrows were powerless to kill the centipede, he lost heart and began to tremble with fear.",
    "The warrior saw that he had now only one arrow left in his quiver, and if this one failed he could not kill the centipede.",
    "He looked across the waters.",
    "The huge reptile had wound its horrid body seven times round the mountain and would soon come down to the lake.",
    "Nearer and nearer gleamed fireballs of eyes, and the light of its hundred feet began to throw reflections in the still waters of the lake.",
    "Then suddenly the warrior remembered that he had heard that human saliva was deadly to centipedes.",
    "But this was no ordinary centipede.",
    "This was so monstrous that even to think of such a creature made one creep with horror.",
    "Hidesato determined to try his last chance.",
    "So taking his last arrow and first putting the end of it in his mouth, he fitted the notch to his bow, took careful aim once more and let fly.",
    "This time the arrow again hit the centipede right in the middle of its head, but instead of glancing off harmlessly as before, it struck home to the creature’s brain.",
    "Then with a convulsive shudder the serpentine body stopped moving, and the fiery light of its great eyes and hundred feet darkened to a dull glare like the sunset of a stormy day, and then went out in blackness.",
    "A great darkness now overspread the heavens, the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed, and the wind roared in fury, and it seemed as if the world were coming to an end.",
    "The Dragon King and his children and retainers all crouched in different parts of the palace, frightened to death, for the building was shaken to its foundation.",
    "At last the dreadful night was over.",
    "Day dawned beautiful and clear.",
    "The centipede was gone from the mountain.",
    "Then Hidesato called to the Dragon King to come out with him on the balcony, for the centipede was dead and he had nothing more to fear.",
    "Then all the inhabitants of the palace came out with joy, and Hidesato pointed to the lake.",
    "There lay the body of the dead centipede floating on the water, which was dyed red with its blood.",
    "The gratitude of the Dragon King knew no bounds.",
    "The whole family came and bowed down before the warrior, calling him their preserver and the bravest warrior in all Japan.",
    "Another feast was prepared, more sumptuous than the first.",
    "All kinds of fish, prepared in every imaginable way, raw, stewed, boiled and roasted, served on coral trays and crystal dishes, were put before him, and the wine was the best that Hidesato had ever tasted in his life.",
    "To add to the beauty of everything the sun shone brightly, the lake glittered like a liquid diamond, and the palace was a thousand times more beautiful by day than by night.",
    "His host tried to persuade the warrior to stay a few days, but Hidesato insisted on going home, saying that he had now finished what he had come to do, and must return.",
    "The Dragon King and his family were all very sorry to have him leave so soon, but since he would go they begged him to accept a few small presents (so they said) in token of their gratitude to him for delivering them forever from their horrible enemy the centipede.",
    "As the warrior stood in the porch taking leave, a train of fish was suddenly transformed into a retinue of men, all wearing ceremonial robes and dragon’s crowns on their heads to show that they were servants of the great Dragon King.",
    "The presents that they carried were as follows: First, a large bronze bell.",
    "Second, a bag of rice.",
    "Third, a roll of silk.",
    "Fourth, a cooking pot.",
    "Fifth, a bell.",
    "Hidesato did not want to accept all these presents, but as the Dragon King insisted, he could not well refuse.",
    "The Dragon King himself accompanied the warrior as far as the bridge, and then took leave of him with many bows and good wishes, leaving the procession of servants to accompany Hidesato to his house with the presents.",
    "The warrior’s household and servants had been very much concerned when they found that he did not return the night before, but they finally concluded that he had been kept by the violent storm and had taken shelter somewhere.",
    "When the servants on the watch for his return caught sight of him they called to every one that he was approaching, and the whole household turned out to meet him, wondering much what the retinue of men, bearing presents and banners, that followed him, could mean.",
    "As soon as the Dragon King’s retainers had put down the presents they vanished, and Hidesato told all that had happened to him.",
    "The presents which he had received from the grateful Dragon King were found to be of magic power.",
    "The bell only was ordinary, and as Hidesato had no use for it he presented it to the temple near by, where it was hung up, to boom out the hour of day over the surrounding neighborhood.",
    "The single bag of rice, however much was taken from it day after day for the meals of the knight and his whole family, never grew less—the supply in the bag was inexhaustible.",
    "The roll of silk, too, never grew shorter, though time after time long pieces were cut off to make the warrior a new suit of clothes to go to Court in at the New Year.",
    "The cooking pot was wonderful, too.",
    "No matter what was put into it, it cooked deliciously whatever was wanted without any firing—truly a very economical saucepan.",
    "The fame of Hidesato’s fortune spread far and wide, and as there was no need for him to spend money on rice or silk or firing, he became very rich and prosperous, and was henceforth known as My Lord Bag of Rice.",
    "THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW Long, long ago in Japan there lived an old man and his wife.",
    "The old man was a good, kind-hearted, hard-working old fellow, but his wife was a regular cross-patch, who spoiled the happiness of her home by her scolding tongue.",
    "She was always grumbling about something from morning to night.",
    "The old man had for a long time ceased to take any notice of her crossness.",
    "He was out most of the day at work in the fields, and as he had no child, for his amusement when he came home, he kept a tame sparrow.",
    "He loved the little bird just as much as if she had been his child.",
    "When he came back at night after his hard day’s work in the open air it was his only pleasure to pet the sparrow, to talk to her and to teach her little tricks, which she learned very quickly.",
    "The old man would open her cage and let her fly about the room, and they would play together.",
    "Then when supper-time came, he always saved some tit-bits from his meal with which to feed his little bird.",
    "Now one day the old man went out to chop wood in the forest, and the old woman stopped at home to wash clothes.",
    "The day before, she had made some starch, and now when she came to look for it, it was all gone; the bowl which she had filled full yesterday was quite empty.",
    "While she was wondering who could have used or stolen the starch, down flew the pet sparrow, and bowing her little feathered head—a trick which she had been taught by her master—the pretty bird chirped and said: “It is I who have taken the starch.",
    "I thought it was some food put out for me in that basin, and I ate it all.",
    "If I have made a mistake I beg you to forgive me!",
    "tweet, tweet, tweet!”",
    "You see from this that the sparrow was a truthful bird, and the old woman ought to have been willing to forgive her at once when she asked her pardon so nicely.",
    "But not so.",
    "The old woman had never loved the sparrow, and had often quarreled with her husband for keeping what she called a dirty bird about the house, saying that it only made extra work for her.",
    "Now she was only too delighted to have some cause of complaint against the pet.",
    "She scolded and even cursed the poor little bird for her bad behavior, and not content with using these harsh, unfeeling words, in a fit of rage she seized the sparrow—who all this time had spread out her wings and bowed her head before the old woman, to show how sorry she was—and fetched the scissors and cut off the poor little bird’s tongue.",
    "“I suppose you took my starch with that tongue!",
    "Now you may see what it is like to go without it!”",
    "And with these dreadful words she drove the bird away, not caring in the least what might happen to it and without the smallest pity for its suffering, so unkind was she!",
    "The old woman, after she had driven the sparrow away, made some more rice-paste, grumbling all the time at the trouble, and after starching all her clothes, spread the things on boards to dry in the sun, instead of ironing them as they do in England.",
    "In the evening the old man came home.",
    "As usual, on the way back he looked forward to the time when he should reach his gate and see his pet come flying and chirping to meet him, ruffling out her feathers to show her joy, and at last coming to rest on his shoulder.",
    "But to-night the old man was very disappointed, for not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen.",
    "He quickened his steps, hastily drew off his straw sandals, and stepped on to the veranda.",
    "Still no sparrow was to be seen.",
    "He now felt sure that his wife, in one of her cross tempers, had shut the sparrow up in its cage.",
    "So he called her and said anxiously: “Where is Suzume San (Miss Sparrow) today?”",
    "The old woman pretended not to know at first, and answered: “Your sparrow?",
    "I am sure I don’t know.",
    "Now I come to think of it, I haven’t seen her all the afternoon.",
    "I shouldn’t wonder if the ungrateful bird had flown away and left you after all your petting!”",
    "But at last, when the old man gave her no peace, but asked her again and again, insisting that she must know what had happened to his pet, she confessed all.",
    "She told him crossly how the sparrow had eaten the rice-paste she had specially made for starching her clothes, and how when the sparrow had confessed to what she had done, in great anger she had taken her scissors and cut out her tongue, and how finally she had driven the bird away and forbidden her to return to the house again.",
    "Then the old woman showed her husband the sparrow’s tongue, saying: “Here is the tongue I cut off!",
    "Horrid little bird, why did it eat all my starch?”",
    "“How could you be so cruel?",
    "Oh!",
    "how could you so cruel?” was all that the old man could answer.",
    "He was too kind-hearted to punish his be shrew of a wife, but he was terribly distressed at what had happened to his poor little sparrow.",
    "“What a dreadful misfortune for my poor Suzume San to lose her tongue!”",
    "he said to himself.",
    "“She won’t be able to chirp any more, and surely the pain of the cutting of it out in that rough way must have made her ill!",
    "Is there nothing to be done?”",
    "The old man shed many tears after his cross wife had gone to sleep.",
    "While he wiped away the tears with the sleeve of his cotton robe, a bright thought comforted him: he would go and look for the sparrow on the morrow.",
    "Having decided this he was able to go to sleep at last.",
    "The next morning he rose early, as soon as ever the day broke, and snatching a hasty breakfast, started out over the hills and through the woods, stopping at every clump of bamboos to cry: “Where, oh where does my tongue-cut sparrow stay?",
    "Where, oh where, does my tongue-cut sparrow stay!”",
    "He never stopped to rest for his noonday meal, and it was far on in the afternoon when he found himself near a large bamboo wood.",
    "Bamboo groves are the favorite haunts of sparrows, and there sure enough at the edge of the wood he saw his own dear sparrow waiting to welcome him.",
    "He could hardly believe his eyes for joy, and ran forward quickly to greet her.",
    "She bowed her little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her, to show her pleasure at seeing her old friend again, and, wonderful to relate, she could talk as of old.",
    "The old man told her how sorry he was for all that had happened, and inquired after her tongue, wondering how she could speak so well without it.",
    "Then the sparrow opened her beak and showed him that a new tongue had grown in place of the old one, and begged him not to think any more about the past, for she was quite well now.",
    "Then the old man knew that his sparrow was a fairy, and no common bird.",
    "It would be difficult to exaggerate the old man’s rejoicing now.",
    "He forgot all his troubles, he forgot even how tired he was, for he had found his lost sparrow, and instead of being ill and without a tongue as he had feared and expected to find her, she was well and happy and with a new tongue, and without a sign of the ill-treatment she had received from his wife.",
    "And above all she was a fairy.",
    "The sparrow asked him to follow her, and flying before him she led him to a beautiful house in the heart of the bamboo grove.",
    "The old man was utterly astonished when he entered the house to find what a beautiful place it was.",
    "It was built of the whitest wood, the soft cream-colored mats which took the place of carpets were the finest he had ever seen, and the cushions that the sparrow brought out for him to sit on were made of the finest silk and crape.",
    "Beautiful vases and lacquer boxes adorned the tokonoma[1] of every room.",
    "[1] An alcove where precious objects are displayed.",
    "The sparrow led the old man to the place of honor, and then, taking her place at a humble distance, she thanked him with many polite bows for all the kindness he had shown her for many long years.",
    "Then the Lady Sparrow, as we will now call her, introduced all her family to the old man.",
    "This done, her daughters, robed in dainty crape gowns, brought in on beautiful old-fashioned trays a feast of all kinds of delicious foods, till the old man began to think he must be dreaming.",
    "In the middle of the dinner some of the sparrow’s daughters performed a wonderful dance, called the “suzume-odori” or the “Sparrow’s dance,” to amuse the guest.",
    "Never had the old man enjoyed himself so much.",
    "The hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot, with all these fairy sparrows to wait upon him and to feast him and to dance before him.",
    "But the night came on and the darkness reminded him that he had a long way to go and must think about taking his leave and return home.",
    "He thanked his kind hostess for her splendid entertainment, and begged her for his sake to forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife.",
    "He told the Lady Sparrow that it was a great comfort and happiness to him to find her in such a beautiful home and to know that she wanted for nothing.",
    "It was his anxiety to know how she fared and what had really happened to her that had led him to seek her.",
    "Now he knew that all was well he could return home with a light heart.",
    "If ever she wanted him for anything she had only to send for him and he would come at once.",
    "The Lady Sparrow begged him to stay and rest several days and enjoy the change, but the old man said he must return to his old wife—who would probably be cross at his not coming home at the usual time—and to his work, and there-fore, much as he wished to do so, he could not accept her kind invitation.",
    "But now that he knew where the Lady Sparrow lived he would come to see her whenever he had the time.",
    "When the Lady Sparrow saw that she could not persuade the old man to stay longer, she gave an order to some of her servants, and they at once brought in two boxes, one large and the other small.",
    "These were placed before the old man, and the Lady Sparrow asked him to choose whichever he liked for a present, which she wished to give him.",
    "The old man could not refuse this kind proposal, and he chose the smaller box, saying: “I am now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box.",
    "As you are so kind as to say that I may take whichever I like, I will choose the small one, which will be easier for me to carry.”",
    "Then the sparrows all helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off, bidding him good-by with many bows and entreating him to come again whenever he had the time.",
    "Thus the old man and his pet sparrow separated quite happily, the sparrow showing not the least ill-will for all the unkindness she had suffered at the hands of the old wife.",
    "Indeed, she only felt sorrow for the old man who had to put up with it all his life.",
    "When the old man reached home he found his wife even crosser than usual, for it was late on in the night and she had been waiting up for him for a long time.",
    "“Where have you been all this time?”",
    "she asked in a big voice.",
    "“Why do you come back so late?”",
    "The old man tried to pacify her by showing her the box of presents he had brought back with him, and then he told her of all that had happened to him, and how wonderfully he had been entertained at the sparrow’s house.",
    "“Now let us see what is in the box,” said the old man, not giving her time to grumble again.",
    "“You must help me open it.”",
    "And they both sat down before the box and opened it.",
    "To their utter astonishment they found the box filled to the brim with gold and silver coins and many other precious things.",
    "The mats of their little cottage fairly glittered as they took out the things one by one and put them down and handled them over and over again.",
    "The old man was overjoyed at the sight of the riches that were now his.",
    "Beyond his brightest expectations was the sparrow’s gift, which would enable him to give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days.",
    "He said: “Thanks to my good little sparrow!",
    "Thanks to my good little sparrow!”",
    "many times.",
    "But the old woman, after the first moments of surprise and satisfaction at the sight of the gold and silver were over, could not suppress the greed of her wicked nature.",
    "She now began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents, for in the innocence of his heart he had told her how he had refused the large box of presents which the sparrows had offered him, preferring the smaller one because it was light and easy to carry home.",
    "“You silly old man,” said she, “Why did you not bring the large box?",
    "Just think what we have lost.",
    "We might have had twice as much silver and gold as this.",
    "You are certainly an old fool!”",
    "she screamed, and then went to bed as angry as she could be.",
    "The old man now wished that he had said nothing about the big box, but it was too late; the greedy old woman, not contented with the good luck which had so unexpectedly befallen them and which she so little deserved, made up her mind, if possible, to get more.",
    "Early the next morning she got up and made the old man describe the way to the sparrow’s house.",
    "When he saw what was in her mind he tried to keep her from going, but it was useless.",
    "She would not listen to one word he said.",
    "It is strange that the old woman did not feel ashamed of going to see the sparrow after the cruel way she had treated her in cutting off her tongue in a fit of rage.",
    "But her greed to get the big box made her forget everything else.",
    "It did not even enter her thoughts that the sparrows might be angry with her—as, indeed, they were—and might punish her for what she had done.",
    "Ever since the Lady Sparrow had returned home in the sad plight in which they had first found her, weeping and bleeding from the mouth, her whole family and relations had done little else but speak of the cruelty of the old woman.",
    "“How could she,” they asked each other, “inflict such a heavy punishment for such a trifling offense as that of eating some rice-paste by mistake?”",
    "They all loved the old man who was so kind and good and patient under all his troubles, but the old woman they hated, and they determined, if ever they had the chance, to punish her as she deserved.",
    "They had not long to wait.",
    "After walking for some hours the old woman had at last found the bamboo grove which she had made her husband carefully describe, and now she stood before it crying out: “Where is the tongue-cut sparrow’s house?",
    "Where is the tongue-cut sparrow’s house?”",
    "At last she saw the eaves of the house peeping out from amongst the bamboo foliage.",
    "She hastened to the door and knocked loudly.",
    "When the servants told the Lady Sparrow that her old mistress was at the door asking to see her, she was somewhat surprised at the unexpected visit, after all that had taken place, and she wondered not a little at the boldness of the old woman in venturing to come to the house.",
    "The Lady Sparrow, however, was a polite bird, and so she went out to greet the old woman, remembering that she had once been her mistress.",
    "The old woman intended, however, to waste no time in words, she went right to the point, without the least shame, and said: “You need not trouble to entertain me as you did my old man.",
    "I have come myself to get the box which he so stupidly left behind.",
    "I shall soon take my leave if you will give me the big box—that is all I want!”",
    "The Lady Sparrow at once consented, and told her servants to bring out the big box.",
    "The old woman eagerly seized it and hoisted it on her back, and without even stopping to thank the Lady Sparrow began to hurry homewards.",
    "The box was so heavy that she could not walk fast, much less run, as she would have liked to do, so anxious was she to get home and see what was inside the box, but she had often to sit down and rest herself by the way.",
    "While she was staggering along under the heavy load, her desire to open the box became too great to be resisted.",
    "She could wait no longer, for she supposed this big box to be full of gold and silver and precious jewels like the small one her husband had received.",
    "At last this greedy and selfish old woman put down the box by the wayside and opened it carefully, expecting to gloat her eyes on a mine of wealth.",
    "What she saw, however, so terrified her that she nearly lost her senses.",
    "As soon as she lifted the lid, a number of horrible and frightful looking demons bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her.",
    "Not even in nightmares had she ever seen such horrible creatures as her much-coveted box contained.",
    "A demon with one huge eye right in the middle of its forehead came and glared at her, monsters with gaping mouths looked as if they would devour her, a huge snake coiled and hissed about her, and a big frog hopped and croaked towards her.",
    "The old woman had never been so frightened in her life, and ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her, glad to escape alive.",
    "When she reached home she fell to the floor and told her husband with tears all that had happened to her, and how she had been nearly killed by the demons in the box.",
    "Then she began to blame the sparrow, but the old man stopped her at once, saying: “Don’t blame the sparrow, it is your wickedness which has at last met with its reward.",
    "I only hope this may be a lesson to you in the future!”",
    "The old woman said nothing more, and from that day she repented of her cross, unkind ways, and by degrees became a good old woman, so that her husband hardly knew her to be the same person, and they spent their last days together happily, free from want or care, spending carefully the treasure the old man had received from his pet, the tongue-cut sparrow.",
    "THE STORY OF URASHIMA TARO, THE FISHER LAD Long, long ago in the province of Tango there lived on the shore of Japan in the little fishing village of Mizu-no-ye a young fisherman named Urashima Taro.",
    "His father had been a fisherman before him, and his skill had more than doubly descended to his son, for Urashima was the most skillful fisher in all that country side, and could catch more Bonito and Tai in a day than his comrades could in a week.",
    "But in the little fishing village, more than for being a clever fisher of the sea was he known for his kind heart.",
    "In his whole life he had never hurt anything, either great or small, and when a boy, his companions had always laughed at him, for he would never join with them in teasing animals, but always tried to keep them from this cruel sport.",
    "One soft summer twilight he was going home at the end of a day’s fishing when he came upon a group of children.",
    "They were all screaming and talking at the tops of their voices, and seemed to be in a state of great excitement about something, and on his going up to them to see what was the matter he saw that they were tormenting a tortoise.",
    "First one boy pulled it this way, then another boy pulled it that way, while a third child beat it with a stick, and the fourth hammered its shell with a stone.",
    "Now Urashima felt very sorry for the poor tortoise and made up his mind to rescue it.",
    "He spoke to the boys: “Look here, boys, you are treating that poor tortoise so badly that it will soon die!”",
    "The boys, who were all of an age when children seem to delight in being cruel to animals, took no notice of Urashima’s gentle reproof, but went on teasing it as before.",
    "One of the older boys answered: “Who cares whether it lives or dies?",
    "We do not.",
    "Here, boys, go on, go on!”",
    "And they began to treat the poor tortoise more cruelly than ever.",
    "Urashima waited a moment, turning over in his mind what would be the best way to deal with the boys.",
    "He would try to persuade them to give the tortoise up to him, so he smiled at them and said: “I am sure you are all good, kind boys!",
    "Now won’t you give me the tortoise?",
    "I should like to have it so much!”",
    "“No, we won’t give you the tortoise,” said one of the boys.",
    "“Why should we?",
    "We caught it ourselves.”",
    "“What you say is true,” said Urashima, “but I do not ask you to give it to me for nothing.",
    "I will give you some money for it—in other words, the Ojisan (Uncle) will buy it of you.",
    "Won’t that do for you, my boys?”",
    "He held up the money to them, strung on a piece of string through a hole in the center of each coin.",
    "“Look, boys, you can buy anything you like with this money.",
    "You can do much more with this money than you can with that poor tortoise.",
    "See what good boys you are to listen to me.”",
    "The boys were not bad boys at all, they were only mischievous, and as Urashima spoke they were won by his kind smile and gentle words and began “to be of his spirit,” as they say in Japan.",
    "Gradually they all came up to him, the ringleader of the little band holding out the tortoise to him.",
    "“Very well, Ojisan, we will give you the tortoise if you will give us the money!”",
    "And Urashima took the tortoise and gave the money to the boys, who, calling to each other, scampered away and were soon out of sight.",
    "Then Urashima stroked the tortoise’s back, saying as he did so: “Oh, you poor thing!",
    "Poor thing!—there, there!",
    "you are safe now!",
    "They say that a stork lives for a thousand years, but the tortoise for ten thousand years.",
    "You have the longest life of any creature in this world, and you were in great danger of having that precious life cut short by those cruel boys.",
    "Luckily I was passing by and saved you, and so life is still yours.",
    "Now I am going to take you back to your home, the sea, at once.",
    "Do not let yourself be caught again, for there might be no one to save you next time!”",
    "All the time that the kind fisherman was speaking he was walking quickly to the shore and out upon the rocks; then putting the tortoise into the water he watched the animal disappear, and turned homewards himself, for he was tired and the sun had set.",
    "The next morning Urashima went out as usual in his boat.",
    "The weather was fine and the sea and sky were both blue and soft in the tender haze of the summer morning.",
    "Urashima got into his boat and dreamily pushed out to sea, throwing his line as he did so.",
    "He soon passed the other fishing boats and left them behind him till they were lost to sight in the distance, and his boat drifted further and further out upon the blue waters.",
    "Somehow, he knew not why, he felt unusually happy that morning; and he could not help wishing that, like the tortoise he set free the day before, he had thousands of years to live instead of his own short span of human life.",
    "He was suddenly startled from his reverie by hearing his own name called: “Urashima, Urashima!”",
    "Clear as a bell and soft as the summer wind the name floated over the sea.",
    "He stood up and looked in every direction, thinking that one of the other boats had overtaken him, but gaze as he might over the wide expanse of water, near or far there was no sign of a boat, so the voice could not have come from any human being.",
    "Startled, and wondering who or what it was that had called him so clearly, he looked in all directions round about him and saw that without his knowing it a tortoise had come to the side of the boat.",
    "Urashima saw with surprise that it was the very tortoise he had rescued the day before.",
    "“Well, Mr. Tortoise,” said Urashima, “was it you who called my name just now?”",
    "The tortoise nodded its head several times and said: “Yes, it was I. Yesterday in your honorable shadow (o kage sama de) my life was saved, and I have come to offer you my thanks and to tell you how grateful I am for your kindness to me.”",
    "“Indeed,” said Urashima, “that is very polite of you.",
    "Come up into the boat.",
    "I would offer you a smoke, but as you are a tortoise doubtless you do not smoke,” and the fisherman laughed at the joke.",
    "“He-he-he-he!” laughed the tortoise; “sake (rice wine) is my favorite refreshment, but I do not care for tobacco.”",
    "“Indeed,” said Urashima, “I regret very much that I have no “sake” in my boat to offer you, but come up and dry your back in the sun—tortoises always love to do that.”",
    "So the tortoise climbed into the boat, the fisherman helping him, and after an exchange of complimentary speeches the tortoise said: “Have you ever seen Rin Gin, the Palace of the Dragon King of the Sea, Urashima?”",
    "The fisherman shook his head and replied; “No; year after year the sea has been my home, but though I have often heard of the Dragon King’s realm under the sea I have never yet set eyes on that wonderful place.",
    "It must be very far away, if it exists at all!”",
    "“Is that really so?",
    "You have never seen the Sea King’s Palace?",
    "Then you have missed seeing one of the most wonderful sights in the whole universe.",
    "It is far away at the bottom of the sea, but if I take you there we shall soon reach the place.",
    "If you would like to see the Sea King’s land I will be your guide.”",
    "“I should like to go there, certainly, and you are very kind to think of taking me, but you must remember that I am only a poor mortal and have not the power of swimming like a sea creature such as you are—” Before the fisherman could say more the tortoise stopped him, saying: “What?",
    "You need not swim yourself.",
    "If you will ride on my back I will take you without any trouble on your part.”",
    "“But,” said Urashima, “how is it possible for me to ride on your small back?”",
    "“It may seem absurd to you, but I assure you that you can do so.",
    "Try at once!",
    "Just come and get on my back, and see if it is as impossible as you think!”",
    "As the tortoise finished speaking, Urashima looked at its shell, and strange to say he saw that the creature had suddenly grown so big that a man could easily sit on its back.",
    "“This is strange indeed!” said Urashima; “then.",
    "Mr. Tortoise, with your kind permission I will get on your back.",
    "Dokoisho!”[2] he exclaimed as he jumped on.",
    "[2] “All right” (only used by lower classes).",
    "The tortoise, with an unmoved face, as if this strange proceeding were quite an ordinary event, said: “Now we will set out at our leisure,” and with these words he leapt into the sea with Urashima on his back.",
    "Down through the water the tortoise dived.",
    "For a long time these two strange companions rode through the sea.",
    "Urashima never grew tired, nor his clothes moist with the water.",
    "At last, far away in the distance a magnificent gate appeared, and behind the gate, the long, sloping roofs of a palace on the horizon.",
    "“Ya,” exclaimed Urashima.",
    "“That looks like the gate of some large palace just appearing!",
    "Mr. Tortoise, can you tell what that place is we can now see?”",
    "“That is the great gate of the Rin Gin Palace, the large roof that you see behind the gate is the Sea King’s Palace itself.”",
    "“Then we have at last come to the realm of the Sea King and to his Palace,” said Urashima.",
    "“Yes, indeed,” answered the tortoise, “and don’t you think we have come very quickly?”",
    "And while he was speaking the tortoise reached the side of the gate.",
    "“And here we are, and you must please walk from here.”",
    "The tortoise now went in front, and speaking to the gatekeeper, said: “This is Urashima Taro, from the country of Japan.",
    "I have had the honor of bringing him as a visitor to this kingdom.",
    "Please show him the way.”",
    "Then the gatekeeper, who was a fish, at once led the way through the gate before them.",
    "The red bream, the flounder, the sole, the cuttlefish, and all the chief vassals of the Dragon King of the Sea now came out with courtly bows to welcome the stranger.",
    "“Urashima Sama, Urashima Sama! welcome to the Sea Palace, the home of the Dragon King of the Sea.",
    "Thrice welcome are you, having come from such a distant country.",
    "And you, Mr. Tortoise, we are greatly indebted to you for all your trouble in bringing Urashima here.”",
    "Then, turning again to Urashima, they said, “Please follow us this way,” and from here the whole band of fishes became his guides.",
    "Urashima, being only a poor fisher lad, did not know how to behave in a palace; but, strange though it was all to him, he did not feel ashamed or embarrassed, but followed his kind guides quite calmly where they led to the inner palace.",
    "When he reached the portals a beautiful Princess with her attendant maidens came out to welcome him.",
    "She was more beautiful than any human being, and was robed in flowing garments of red and soft green like the under side of a wave, and golden threads glimmered through the folds of her gown.",
    "Her lovely black hair streamed over her shoulders in the fashion of a king’s daughter many hundreds of years ago, and when she spoke her voice sounded like music over the water.",
    "Urashima was lost in wonder while he looked upon her, and he could not speak.",
    "Then he remembered that he ought to bow, but before he could make a low obeisance the Princess took him by the hand and led him to a beautiful hall, and to the seat of honor at the upper end, and bade him be seated.",
    "“Urashima Taro, it gives me the highest pleasure to welcome you to my father’s kingdom,” said the Princess.",
    "“Yesterday you set free a tortoise, and I have sent for you to thank you for saving my life, for I was that tortoise.",
    "Now if you like you shall live here forever in the land of eternal youth, where summer never dies and where sorrow never comes, and I will be your bride if you will, and we will live together happily forever afterwards!”",
    "And as Urashima listened to her sweet words and gazed upon her lovely face his heart was filled with a great wonder and joy, and he answered her, wondering if it was not all a dream: “Thank you a thousand times for your kind speech.",
    "There is nothing I could wish for more than to be permitted to stay here with you in this beautiful land, of which I have often heard, but have never seen to this day.",
    "Beyond all words, this is the most wonderful place I have ever seen.”",
    "While he was speaking a train of fishes appeared, all dressed in ceremonial, trailing garments.",
    "One by one, silently and with stately steps, they entered the hall, bearing on coral trays delicacies of fish and seaweed, such as no one can dream of, and this wondrous feast was set before the bride and bridegroom.",
    "The bridal was celebrated with dazzling splendor, and in the Sea King’s realm there was great rejoicing.",
    "As soon as the young pair had pledged themselves in the wedding cup of wine, three times three, music was played, and songs were sung, and fishes with silver scales and golden tails stepped in from the waves and danced.",
    "Urashima enjoyed himself with all his heart.",
    "Never in his whole life had he sat down to such a marvelous feast.",
    "When the feast was over the Princes asked the bridegroom if he would like to walk through the palace and see all there was to be seen.",
    "Then the happy fisherman, following his bride, the Sea King’s daughter, was shown all the wonders of that enchanted land where youth and joy go hand in hand and neither time nor age can touch them.",
    "The palace was built of coral and adorned with pearls, and the beauties and wonders of the place were so great that the tongue fails to describe them.",
    "But, to Urashima, more wonderful than the palace was the garden that surrounded it.",
    "Here was to be seen at one time the scenery of the four different seasons; the beauties of summer and winter, spring and autumn, were displayed to the wondering visitor at once.",
    "First, when he looked to the east, the plum and cherry trees were seen in full bloom, the nightingales sang in the pink avenues, and butterflies flitted from flower to flower.",
    "Looking to the south all the trees were green in the fullness of summer, and the day cicala and the night cricket chirruped loudly.",
    "Looking to the west the autumn maples were ablaze like a sunset sky, and the chrysanthemums were in perfection.",
    "Looking to the north the change made Urashima start, for the ground was silver white with snow, and trees and bamboos were also covered with snow and the pond was thick with ice.",
    "And each day there were new joys and new wonders for Urashima, and so great was his happiness that he forgot everything, even the home he had left behind and his parents and his own country, and three days passed without his even thinking of all he had left behind.",
    "Then his mind came back to him and he remembered who he was, and that he did not belong to this wonderful land or the Sea King’s palace, and he said to himself: “O dear!",
    "I must not stay on here, for I have an old father and mother at home.",
    "What can have happened to them all this time?",
    "How anxious they must have been these days when I did not return as usual.",
    "I must go back at once without letting one more day pass.”",
    "And he began to prepare for the journey in great haste.",
    "Then he went to his beautiful wife, the Princess, and bowing low before her he said: “Indeed, I have been very happy with you for a long time, Otohime Sama” (for that was her name), “and you have been kinder to me than any words can tell.",
    "But now I must say good-by.",
    "I must go back to my old parents.”",
    "Then Otohime Sama began to weep, and said softly and sadly: “Is it not well with you here, Urashima, that you wish to leave me so soon?",
    "Where is the haste?",
    "Stay with me yet another day only!”",
    "But Urashima had remembered his old parents, and in Japan the duty to parents is stronger than everything else, stronger even than pleasure or love, and he would not be persuaded, but answered: “Indeed, I must go.",
    "Do not think that I wish to leave you.",
    "It is not that.",
    "I must go and see my old parents.",
    "Let me go for one day and I will come back to you.”",
    "“Then,” said the Princess sorrowfully, “there is nothing to be done.",
    "I will send you back to-day to your father and mother, and instead of trying to keep you with me one more day, I shall give you this as a token of our love—please take it back with you;” and she brought him a beautiful lacquer box tied about with a silken cord and tassels of red silk.",
    "Urashima had received so much from the Princess already that he felt some compunction in taking the gift, and said: “It does not seem right for me to take yet another gift from you after all the many favors I have received at your hands, but because it is your wish I will do so,” and then he added: “Tell me what is this box?”",
    "“That,” answered the Princess “is the tamate-bako (Box of the Jewel Hand), and it contains something very precious.",
    "You must not open this box, whatever happens!",
    "If you open it something dreadful will happen to you!",
    "Now promise me that you will never open this box!”",
    "And Urashima promised that he would never, never open the box whatever happened.",
    "Then bidding good-by to Otohime Sama he went down to the seashore, the Princess and her attendants following him, and there he found a large tortoise waiting for him.",
    "He quickly mounted the creature’s back and was carried away over the shining sea into the East.",
    "He looked back to wave his hand to Otohime Sama till at last he could see her no more, and the land of the Sea King and the roofs of the wonderful palace were lost in the far, far distance.",
    "Then, with his face turned eagerly towards his own land, he looked for the rising of the blue hills on the horizon before him.",
    "At last the tortoise carried him into the bay he knew so well, and to the shore from whence he had set out.",
    "He stepped on to the shore and looked about him while the tortoise rode away back to the Sea King’s realm.",
    "But what is the strange fear that seizes Urashima as he stands and looks about him?",
    "Why does he gaze so fixedly at the people that pass him by, and why do they in turn stand and look at him?",
    "The shore is the same and the hills are the same, but the people that he sees walking past him have very different faces to those he had known so well before.",
    "Wondering what it can mean he walks quickly towards his old home.",
    "Even that looks different, but a house stands on the spot, and he calls out: “Father, I have just returned!”",
    "and he was about to enter, when he saw a strange man coming out.",
    "“Perhaps my parents have moved while I have been away, and have gone somewhere else,” was the fisherman’s thought.",
    "Somehow he began to feel strangely anxious, he could not tell why.",
    "“Excuse me,” said he to the man who was staring at him, “but till within the last few days I have lived in this house.",
    "My name is Urashima Taro.",
    "Where have my parents gone whom I left here?”",
    "A very bewildered expression came over the face of the man, and, still gazing intently on Urashima’s face, he said: “What?",
    "Are you Urashima Taro?”",
    "“Yes,” said the fisherman, “I am Urashima Taro!”",
    "“Ha, ha!” laughed the man, “you must not make such jokes.",
    "It is true that once upon a time a man called Urashima Taro did live in this village, but that is a story three hundred years old.",
    "He could not possibly be alive now!”",
    "When Urashima heard these strange words he was frightened, and said: “Please, please, you must not joke with me, I am greatly perplexed.",
    "I am really Urashima Taro, and I certainly have not lived three hundred years.",
    "Till four or five days ago I lived on this spot.",
    "Tell me what I want to know without more joking, please.”",
    "But the man’s face grew more and more grave, and he answered: “You may or may not be Urashima Taro, I don’t know.",
    "But the Urashima Taro of whom I have heard is a man who lived three hundred years ago.",
    "Perhaps you are his spirit come to revisit your old home?”",
    "“Why do you mock me?” said Urashima.",
    "“I am no spirit!",
    "I am a living man—do you not see my feet;” and “don-don,” he stamped on the ground, first with one foot and then with the other to show the man.",
    "(Japanese ghosts have no feet.)",
    "“But Urashima Taro lived three hundred years ago, that is all I know; it is written in the village chronicles,” persisted the man, who could not believe what the fisherman said.",
    "Urashima was lost in bewilderment and trouble.",
    "He stood looking all around him, terribly puzzled, and, indeed, something in the appearance of everything was different to what he remembered before he went away, and the awful feeling came over him that what the man said was perhaps true.",
    "He seemed to be in a strange dream.",
    "The few days he had spent in the Sea King’s palace beyond the sea had not been days at all: they had been hundreds of years, and in that time his parents had died and all the people he had ever known, and the village had written down his story.",
    "There was no use in staying here any longer.",
    "He must get back to his beautiful wife beyond the sea.",
    "He made his way back to the beach, carrying in his hand the box which the Princess had given him.",
    "But which was the way?",
    "He could not find it alone!",
    "Suddenly he remembered the box, the tamate-bako.",
    "“The Princess told me when she gave me the box never to open it—that it contained a very precious thing.",
    "But now that I have no home, now that I have lost everything that was dear to me here, and my heart grows thin with sadness, at such a time, if I open the box, surely I shall find something that will help me, something that will show me the way back to my beautiful Princess over the sea.",
    "There is nothing else for me to do now.",
    "Yes, yes, I will open the box and look in!”",
    "And so his heart consented to this act of disobedience, and he tried to persuade himself that he was doing the right thing in breaking his promise.",
    "Slowly, very slowly, he untied the red silk cord, slowly and wonderingly he lifted the lid of the precious box.",
    "And what did he find?",
    "Strange to say only a beautiful little purple cloud rose out of the box in three soft wisps.",
    "For an instant it covered his face and wavered over him as if loath to go, and then it floated away like vapor over the sea.",
    "Urashima, who had been till that moment like a strong and handsome youth of twenty-four, suddenly became very, very old.",
    "His back doubled up with age, his hair turned snowy white, his face wrinkled and he fell down dead on the beach.",
    "Poor Urashima!",
    "because of his disobedience he could never return to the Sea King’s realm or the lovely Princess beyond the sea.",
    "Little children, never be disobedient to those who are wiser than you for disobedience was the beginning of all the miseries and sorrows of life.",
    "THE FARMER AND THE BADGER Long, long ago, there lived an old farmer and his wife who had made their home in the mountains, far from any town.",
    "Their only neighbor was a bad and malicious badger.",
    "This badger used to come out every night and run across to the farmer’s field and spoil the vegetables and the rice which the farmer spent his time in carefully cultivating.",
    "The badger at last grew so ruthless in his mischievous work, and did so much harm everywhere on the farm, that the good-natured farmer could not stand it any longer, and determined to put a stop to it.",
    "So he lay in wait day after day and night after night, with a big club, hoping to catch the badger, but all in vain.",
    "Then he laid traps for the wicked animal.",
    "The farmer’s trouble and patience was rewarded, for one fine day on going his rounds he found the badger caught in a hole he had dug for that purpose.",
    "The farmer was delighted at having caught his enemy, and carried him home securely bound with rope.",
    "When he reached the house the farmer said to his wife: “I have at last caught the bad badger.",
    "You must keep an eye on him while I am out at work and not let him escape, because I want to make him into soup to-night.”",
    "Saying this, he hung the badger up to the rafters of his storehouse and went out to his work in the fields.",
    "The badger was in great distress, for he did not at all like the idea of being made into soup that night, and he thought and thought for a long time, trying to hit upon some plan by which he might escape.",
    "It was hard to think clearly in his uncomfortable position, for he had been hung upside down.",
    "Very near him, at the entrance to the storehouse, looking out towards the green fields and the trees and the pleasant sunshine, stood the farmer’s old wife pounding barley.",
    "She looked tired and old.",
    "Her face was seamed with many wrinkles, and was as brown as leather, and every now",
    "and then she stopped to wipe the perspiration which rolled down her face.",
    "“Dear lady,” said the wily badger, “you must be very weary doing such heavy work in your old age.",
    "Won’t you let me do that for you?",
    "My arms are very strong, and I could relieve you for a little while!”",
    "“Thank you for your kindness,” said the old woman, “but I cannot let you do this work for me because I must not untie you, for you might escape if I did, and my husband would be very angry if he came home and found you gone.”",
    "Now, the badger is one of the most cunning of animals, and he said again in a very sad, gentle, voice: “You are very unkind.",
    "You might untie me, for I promise not to try to escape.",
    "If you are afraid of your husband, I will let you bind me again before his return when I have finished pounding the barley.",
    "I am so tired and sore tied up like this.",
    "If you would only let me down for a few minutes I would indeed be thankful!”",
    "The old woman had a good and simple nature, and could not think badly of any one.",
    "Much less did she think that the badger was only deceiving her in order to get away.",
    "She felt sorry, too, for the animal as she turned to look at him.",
    "He looked in such a sad plight hanging downwards from the ceiling by his legs, which were all tied together so tightly that the rope and the knots were cutting into the skin.",
    "So in the kindness of her heart, and believing the creature’s promise that he would not run away, she untied the cord and let him down.",
    "The old woman then gave him the wooden pestle and told him to do the work for a short time while she rested.",
    "He took the pestle, but instead of doing the work as he was told, the badger at once sprang upon the old woman and knocked her down with the heavy piece of wood.",
    "He then killed her and cut her up and made soup of her, and waited for the return of the old farmer.",
    "The old man worked hard in his fields all day, and as he worked he thought with pleasure that no more now would his labor be spoiled by the destructive badger.",
    "Towards sunset he left his work and turned to go home.",
    "He was very tired, but the thought of the nice supper of hot badger soup awaiting his return cheered him.",
    "The thought that the badger might get free and take revenge on the poor old woman never once came into his mind.",
    "The badger meanwhile assumed the old woman’s form, and as soon as he saw the old farmer approaching came out to greet him on the veranda of the little house, saying: “So you have come back at last.",
    "I have made the badger soup and have been waiting for you for a long time.”",
    "The old farmer quickly took off his straw sandals and sat down before his tiny dinner-tray.",
    "The innocent man never even dreamed that it was not his wife but the badger who was waiting upon him, and asked at once for the soup.",
    "Then the badger suddenly transformed himself back to his natural form and cried out: “You wife-eating old man!",
    "Look out for the bones in the kitchen!”",
    "Laughing loudly and derisively he escaped out of the house and ran away to his den in the hills.",
    "The old man was left behind alone.",
    "He could hardly believe what he had seen and heard.",
    "Then when he understood the whole truth he was so scared and horrified that he fainted right away.",
    "After a while he came round and burst into tears.",
    "He cried loudly and bitterly.",
    "He rocked himself to and fro in his hopeless grief.",
    "It seemed too terrible to be real that his faithful old wife had been killed and cooked by the badger while he was working quietly in the fields, knowing nothing of"
