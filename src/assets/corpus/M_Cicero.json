    "The letters contained in this volume begin with one written just after Caesar's final victory over the remains of the Pompeian party at Thapsus in April, 46 B.C., and cover three of the last four years of Cicero's life.",
    "When they open, Cicero was enjoying a restful interval after the troublous times of the Civil War.",
    "He had made his peace with Caesar and reconciled himself to a life of retirement and literary activity.",
    "In the Senate he never spoke except to deliver a speech pleading for the return from exile of his friend Marcellus; and his only other public appearance was to advocate the cause of another friend, Ligarius.",
    "In both he was successful; and, indeed, so he seems also to have been in private appeals to Caesar on behalf of friends.",
    "But their relations were never intimate,[1] and Cicero appears always to have felt ill at ease in Caesar's society,[2] disliking and fearing him as a possible tyrant or at least an anomaly in a Republican state.",
    "He evidently felt, too, some natural qualms at being too much of a turn-coat, as he dissuaded his son from joining Caesar's expedition to Spain at the end of the year on that ground, and persuaded him to go to Athens to study instead.[3]",
    "No doubt he considered that it was more consonant with the dignity which he was always claiming for himself to take no part in public affairs at all than to play a secondary part where he had once been first.",
    "Consequently he spent the year 46 peacefully engaged in writing and in his Footnote 1: XIV. 1 and 2.",
    "Footnote 2: XIII.",
    "52.",
    "Footnote 3: XII. 7. private affairs; and even of those we hear little, as he was at Rome the greater part of the time.",
    "Somewhat under protest he wrote, apparently at the suggestion of the Caesarian party,[4] with most of whom he was on good terms, a work on Cato, which satisfied neither friend nor foe, as Brutus thought it necessary to write another himself, and Caesar composed an _Anti-Cato_.",
    "Of his other writings, two rhetorical works, the _Brutus_ and the _Orator_, and one philosophical, the _Paradoxa_, fall in this year.",
    "In the early part of it he divorced Terentia, and at the end of it married his rich and youthful ward Publilia; but he soon separated from her.",
    "The unhappy marriage between his daughter Tullia and her profligate husband, Dolabella, was dissolved at much the same time, but she only survived for a few months.",
    "Her death, which occurred in February, 45 B.C., seems to have prostrated Cicero with grief, and a long series of daily letters, from March to August of that year, are largely filled with reiterations of his grief and projects for the erection of a shrine in her honour.",
    "They are interesting for the light they cast on Atticus' treatment of Cicero when he was unstrung and excited.",
    "Atticus evidently disapproved entirely of the project; but from Cicero's answers one infers that he kept on humouring him and at the same time delaying action on his part by continual suggestions of a fresh site for the shrine, knowing that Cicero's ardour would cool and the scheme drop through, as it did.",
    "Footnote 4: XII. 4.",
    "Much is said, too, in these letters about the literary work to which Cicero turned with more eagerness than ever to assuage his grief; and the output was enormous.",
    "A book on consolation in times of sorrow, a general introduction to the philosophical works which followed, the _De Finibus_, the _Academica_—rewritten, three times[5]—and a small rhetorical treatise, the _Partitiones Oratoriae_, were published during the year, while the _Tusculanae Disputationes_, the _De Natura Deorum_ and the _De Senectute_ were projected and begun.",
    "Certainly Cicero was right in saying that he had no lack of words![6] Footnote 5: XIII.",
    "13 and 16.",
    "Footnote 6: XII. 52.",
    "Of political affairs little is said; indeed, in Caesar's absence there was not much to say.",
    "But there are occasional sneers at the honours paid to him[7] and at his projected extension of Rome.[8]",
    "For the latter part of the year, after Caesar's return from Spain, there are no letters in this collection except two amusing letters in December, one describing a conversation with his nephew, who was trying to make peace with his relatives after a violent quarrel,[9] and the other Cicero's entertainment of Caesar at Puteoli.[10]",
    "Footnote 7: XII. 45; XIII.",
    "27 and 44.",
    "Footnote 8: XIII.",
    "35.",
    "Footnote 9: XIII.",
    "42.",
    "Footnote 10: XIII.",
    "52.",
    "Not long afterwards came the murder of Caesar, at which Cicero to his regret was not present, though he was in Rome and hastened to the Capitol to lend his support to the murderers.",
    "He found, however, the cold Brutus hard to stir into action, and after Antony's speech at the funeral he thought it wiser to retire from Rome.",
    "The letters written at the time are full of rejoicing at the death of a man, towards whom he never seems to have felt any attraction, in spite of the kindness he had received at his hands.",
    "But he soon realised the hopelessness of the Republican cause, which lacked both a leader and a following.",
    "He himself regained something of his old position, and we find him not only consulted by Brutus and the rest of his party, but politely addressed by Antony in a note, asking his permission to recall Cicero's old enemy Clodius.[11] Cicero, taking the request as a demand, returned an equally polite note of assent;[12] but what he thought of the request and of Antony is shown by a letter sent to Atticus simultaneously.[13] For a while there are occasional bursts of hope in a revival of the old constitution, for instance when Dolabella threw down the column erected in the forum in honour of Caesar;[14] but despair at the inactivity of Brutus and his friends and at Antony's growing influence and the respect shown for Caesar's enactment after his death prevail; and Cicero contemplated crossing to Greece to visit his son and escape from the war he foresaw.",
    "Octavian's arrival and opposition to Antony did not comfort him much, in spite of attentions paid to himself by the future emperor, as he mistrusted Octavian's youth, his abilities and his intentions.",
    "But, when just on the point of sailing, news reached him that there was a chance of Antony giving way and peace with something of the old conditions being restored; and he hurried back to Rome to take his part in its restoration.[15] There he found little chance of peace, but, once returned, he recovered sufficient courage to take the lead in the Senate and deliver his first _Philippic_ against Antony.",
    "After that there are only a few letters written towards the end of the year.",
    "In them he still expresses great mistrust for Octavian, who was continually appealing to him for his support;[16] and, in spite of his renewed entry into public affairs, one Footnote 11: XIV.",
    "13a.",
    "Footnote 12: XIV. 13b.",
    "Footnote 13: XIV. 13.",
    "Footnote 14: XIV. 15.",
    "Footnote 15: XVI.",
    "7.",
    "Footnote 16: XVI. 9 and 11 is rather surprised to find that he was still working at his philosophical treatises, writing the _De Officiis_ to dedicate to his son,[17] and even eager to turn to history at the suggestion of Atticus.[18]",
    "Such is the last glimpse we get of him in the _Letters to Atticus_.",
    "Shortly afterwards he returned to Rome, and for some six months led the senatorial party in its opposition to Antony; but, when Octavian too turned against the party and the struggle became hopeless, he retired to Tusculum, where he lived until he was proscribed by the Triumvirs early in December.",
    "Then he contemplated flight to Greece, but was killed at Astura before he had succeeded in leaving Italy.",
    "Footnote 17: XVI. 11.",
    "Footnote 18: XVI. 13b.",
    "I must again acknowledge my indebtedness in preparing the translation to Tyrrell's edition of the Letters and to Shuckburgh's translation, from both of which I have \"conveyed\" many a phrase.",
    "The text is as usual based on the Teubner edition, and textual notes have been mainly confined to passages where a reading not found in that edition was adopted.",
    "In those notes the following abbreviations are used:— _M_ = the _Codex Mediceus_ 49, 18, written in the year 1389 A.D., and now preserved in the Laurentian Library at Florence.",

    "THE ARGUMENT When Julius, or, as he is usually called by Cicero Caius Caesar was slain on the 15th of March, A.U.C. 710, B.C. 44 Marcus Antonius was his colleague in the consulship, and he, being afraid that the conspirators might murder him too, (and it is said that they had debated among themselves whether they would or no) concealed himself on that day and fortified his house, till perceiving that nothing was intended against him, he ventured to appear in public the day following.",
    "Lepidus was in the suburbs of Rome with a regular army, ready to depart for the government of Spain, which had been assigned to him with a part of Gaul.",
    "In the night, after Caesar's death he occupied the forum with his troops and thought of making himself master of the city, but Antonius dissuaded him from that idea and won him over to his views by giving his daughter in marriage to Lepidus's son, and by assisting him to seize on the office of Pontifex Maximus, which was vacant by Caesar's death.",
    "To the conspirators he professed friendship, sent his son among them as a hostage of his sincerity, and so deluded them, that Brutus supped with Lepidus, and Cassius with Antonius.",
    "By these means he got them to consent to his passing a decree for the confirmation of all Caesar's acts, without describing or naming them more precisely.",
    "At last, on the occasion of Caesar's public funeral, he contrived so to inflame the populace against the conspirators, that Brutus and Cassius had some difficulty in defending their houses and their lives and he gradually alarmed them so much, and worked so cunningly on their fears that they all quitted Rome.",
    "Cicero also left Rome, disapproving greatly of the vacillation and want of purpose in the conspirators.",
    "On the first of June Antonius assembled the senate to deliberate on the affairs of the republic, and in the interval visited all parts of Italy.",
    "In the meantime young Octavius appeared on the stage; he had been left by Caesar, who was his uncle, the heir to his name and estate.",
    "He returned from Apollonia, in Macedonia, to Italy as soon as he heard of his uncle's death, and arrived at Naples on the eighteenth of April, where he was introduced by Hirtius and Pansa to Cicero, whom he promised to be guided in all respects by his directions.",
    "He was now between eighteen and nineteen years of age.",
    "He began by the representation of public spectacles and games in honour of Caesar's victories.",
    "In the meantime Antonius, in his progress through Italy, was making great use of the decree confirming all Caesar's acts, which he interpolated and forged in the most shameless manner.",
    "Among other things he restored Deiotarus to all his dominions, having been bribed to do so by a hundred millions of sesterces by the king's agents, but Deiotarus himself, as soon as he heard of Caesar's death, seized all his dominions by force.",
    "He also seized the public treasure which Caesar had deposited in the temple of Ops, amounting to above four millions and a half of our money, and with this he won over Dolabella,[1] who had seized the consulship on the death of Caesar, and the greater part of the army.",
    "At the end of May Cicero began to return towards Rome, in order to arrive there in time for the meeting of the senate on the first of June, but many of his friends dissuaded him from entering the city, and at last he determined not to appear in the senate on that day, but to make a tour in Greece, to assist him in which, Dolabella named him one of his lieutenants.",
    "Antonius also gave Brutus and Cassius commissions to buy corn in Asia and Sicily for the use of the republic, in order to keep them out of the city.",
    "Meantime Sextus Pompeius, who was at the head of a considerable army in Spain, addressed letters to the consuls proposing terms of accommodation, which after some debate, and some important modifications, were agreed to, and he quitted Spain, and came as far as Marseilles on his road towards Rome.",
    "Cicero having started for Greece was forced to put back by contrary winds, and returned to Velia on the seventeenth of August, where he had a long conference with Brutus, who soon after left Italy for his province of Macedonia, which Caesar had assigned him before his death, though Antonius now wished to compel him to exchange it for Crete.",
    "After this conference Cicero returned to Rome, where he was received with unexampled joy, immense multitudes thronging out to meet him, and to escort him into the city.",
    "He arrived in Rome on the last day of August.",
    "The next day the senate met, to which he was particularly summoned by Antonius, but he excused himself as not having recovered from the fatigue of his journey.",
    "Antonius was greatly offended, and in his speech in the senate threatened openly to order his house to be pulled down, the real reason of Cicero's absenting himself from the senate being, that the business of the day was to decree some new and extraordinary honours to Caesar, and to order supplications to him as a divinity, which Cicero was determined not to concur in, though he knew it would be useless to oppose them.",
    "The next day also the senate met, and Antonius absented himself, but Cicero came down and delivered the following speech, which is the first of that celebrated series of fourteen speeches made in opposition to Antonius and his measures, and called Philippics from the orations of Demosthenes against Philip, to which the Romans were in the habit of comparing them.[2] I. Before, O conscript fathers, I say those things concerning the republic which I think myself bound to say at the present time, I will explain to you briefly the cause of my departure from, and of my return to the city.",
    "When I hoped that the republic was at last recalled to a proper respect for your wisdom and for your authority, I thought that it became me to remain in a sort of sentinelship, which was imposed upon me by my position as a senator and a man of consular rank.",
    "Nor did I depart anywhere, nor did I ever take my eyes off from the republic, from the day on which we were summoned to meet in the temple of Tellus,[3] in which temple, I, as far as was in my power, laid the foundations of peace, and renewed the ancient precedent set by the Athenians, I even used the Greek word,[4] which that city employed in those times in allaying discords, and gave my vote that all recollection of the existing dissensions ought to be effaced by everlasting oblivion.",
    "The oration then made by Marcus Antonius was an admirable one, his disposition, too, appeared excellent, and lastly, by his means and by his sons', peace was ratified with the most illustrious of the citizens, and everything else was consistent with this beginning.",
    "He invited the chief men of the state to those deliberations which he held at his own house concerning the state of the republic, he referred all the most important matters to this order.",
    "Nothing was at that time found among the papers of Caius Caesar except what was already well known to everybody, and he gave answers to every question that was asked of him with the greatest consistency.",
    "Were any exiles restored?",
    "He said that one was, and only one.",
    "Were any immunities granted?",
    "He answered, None.",
    "He wished us even to adopt the proposition of Servius Sulpicius, that most illustrious man, that no tablet purporting to contain any decree or grant of Caesar's should be published after the Ides of March were expired.",
    "I pass over many other things, all excellent--for I am hastening to come to a very extraordinary act of virtue of Marcus Antonius.",
    "He utterly abolished from the constitution of the republic the Dictatorship, which had by this time attained to the authority of regal power.",
    "And that measure was not even offered to us for discussion.",
    "He brought with him a decree of the senate, ready drawn up, ordering what he chose to have done: and when it had been read, we all submitted to his authority in the matter with the greatest eagerness; and, by another resolution of the senate, we returned him thanks in the most honourable and complimentary language.",
    "II.",
    "A new light, as it were, seemed to be brought over us, now that not only the kingly power which we had endured, but all fear of such power for the future, was taken away from us; and a great pledge appeared to have been given by him to the republic that he did wish the city to be free, when he utterly abolished out of the republic the name of dictator, which had often been a legitimate title, on account of our late recollection of a perpetual dictatorship.",
    "A few days afterwards the senate was delivered from the danger of bloodshed, and a hook[5] was fixed into that runaway slave who had usurped the name of Caius Marius.",
    "And all these things he did in concert with his colleague.",
    "Some other things that were done were the acts of Dolabella alone; but, if his colleague had not been absent, would, I believe, have been done by both of them in concert.",
    "For when enormous evil was insinuating itself into the republic, and was gaining more strength day by day; and when the same men were erecting a tomb[6] in the forum, who had performed that irregular funeral; and when abandoned men, with slaves like themselves, were every day threatening with more and more vehemence all the houses and temples of the city; so severe was the rigour of Dolabella, not only towards the audacious and wicked slaves, but also towards the profligate and unprincipled freemen, and so prompt was his overthrow of that accursed pillar, that it seems marvellous to me that the subsequent time has been so different from that one day.",
    "For behold, on the first of June, on which day they had given notice that we were all to attend the senate, everything was changed.",
    "Nothing was done by the senate, but many and important measures were transacted by the agency of the people, though that people was both absent and disapproving.",
    "The consuls elect said, that they did not dare to come into the senate.",
    "The liberators of their country were absent from that city from the neck of which they had removed the yoke of slavery; though the very consuls themselves professed to praise them in their public harangues and in all their conversation.",
    "Those who were called Veterans, men of whose safety this order had been most particularly careful, were instigated not to the preservation of those things which they had, but to cherish hopes of new booty.",
    "And as I preferred hearing of those things to seeing them, and as I had an honorary commission as lieutenant, I went away, intending to be present on the first of January, which appeared likely to be the first day of assembling the senate.",
    "III.",
    "I have now explained to you, O conscript fathers, my design in leaving the city.",
    "Now I will briefly set before you, also, my intention in returning, which may perhaps appear more unaccountable.",
    "As I had avoided Brundusium, and the ordinary route into Greece, not without good reason, on the first of August I arrived at Syracuse, because the passage from that city into Greece was said to be a good one.",
    "And that city, with which I had so intimate a connexion, could not, though it was very eager to do so, detain me more than one night.",
    "I was afraid that my sudden arrival among my friends might cause some suspicion if I remained there at all.",
    "But after the winds had driven me, on my departure from Sicily, to Leucopetra, which is a promontory of the Rhegian district, I went up the gulf from that point, with the view of crossing over.",
    "And I had not advanced far before I was driven back by a foul wind to the very place which I had just quitted.",
    "And as the night was stormy, and as I had lodged that night in the villa of Publius Valerius, my companion and intimate friend, and as I remained all the nest day at his house waiting for a fair wind, many of the citizens of the municipality of Rhegium came to me.",
    "And of them there were some who had lately arrived from Rome; from them I first heard of the harangue of Marcus Antonius, with which I was so much pleased that, after I had read it, I began for the first time to think of returning.",
    "And not long afterwards the edict of Brutus and Cassius is brought to me; which (perhaps because I love those men, even more for the sake of the republic than of my own friendship for them) appeared to me, indeed, to be full of equity.",
    "They added besides, (for it is a very common thing for those who are desirous of bringing good news to invent something to make the news which they bring seem more joyful,) that parties were coming to an agreement; that the senate was to meet on the first of August; that Antonius having discarded all evil counsellors, and having given up the provinces of Gaul, was about to return to submission to the authority of the senate.",
    "IV.",
    "But on this I was inflamed with such eagerness to return, that no oars or winds could be fast enough for me; not that I thought that I should not arrive in time, but lest I should be later than I wished in congratulating the republic; and I quickly arrived at Velia, where I saw Brutus; how grieved I was, I cannot express.",
    "For it seemed to be a discreditable thing for me myself, that I should venture to return into that city from which Brutus was departing, and that I should be willing to live safely in a place where he could not.",
    "But he himself was not agitated in the same manner that I was; for, being elevated with the consciousness of his great and glorious exploit, he had no complaints to make of what had befallen him, though he lamented your fate exceedingly.",
    "And it was from him that I first heard what had been the language of Lucius Piso, in the senate of August; who, although he was but little assisted (for that I heard from Brutus himself) by those who ought to have seconded him, still according to the testimony of Brutus, (and what evidence can be more trustworthy?)",
    "and to the avowal of every one whom I saw afterwards, appeared to me to have gained great credit.",
    "I hastened hither, therefore, in order that as those who were present had not seconded him, I might do so; not with the hope of doing any good, for I neither hoped for that, nor did I well see how it was possible; but in order that if anything happened to me, (and many things appeared to be threatening me out of the regular course of nature, and even of destiny,) I might still leave my speech on this day as a witness to the republic of my everlasting attachment to its interests.",
    "Since, then, O conscript fathers, I trust that the reason of my adopting each determination appears praiseworthy to you, before I begin to speak of the republic, I will make a brief complaint of the injury which Marcus Antonius did me yesterday, to whom I am friendly, and I have at all times admitted having received some services from him which make it my duty to be so.",
    "V.",
    "What reason had he then for endeavouring, with such bitter hostility, to force me into the senate yesterday?",
    "Was I the only person who was absent?",
    "Have you not repeatedly had thinner houses than yesterday?",
    "Or was a matter of such importance under discussion, that it was desirable for even sick men to be brought down?",
    "Hannibal, I suppose, was at the gates, or there was to be a debate about peace with Pyrrhus, on which occasion it is related that even the great Appius, old and blind as he was, was brought down to the senate-house.",
    "There was a motion being made about some supplications, a kind of measure when senators are not usually wanting, for they are under the compulsion, not of pledges, but of the influence of those men whose honour is being complimented, and the case is the same when the motion has reference to a triumph.",
    "The consuls are so free from anxiety at these times, that it is almost entirely free for a senator to absent himself if he pleases.",
    "And as the general custom of our body was well known to me, and as I was hardly recovered from the fatigue of my journey, and was vexed with myself, I sent a man to him, out of regard for my friendship to him, to tell him that I should not be there.",
    "But he, in the hearing of you all, declared that he would come with masons to my house; this was said with too much passion and very intemperately.",
    "For, for what crime is there such a heavy punishment appointed as that, that any one should venture to say in this assembly that he, with the assistance of a lot of common operatives, would pull down a house which had been built at the public expense in accordance with a vote of the senate?",
    "And who ever employed such compulsion as the threat of such an injury as to a senator?",
    "or what severer punishment has ever been he himself was unable to perform?",
    "As, in fact, he has failed to perform many promises made to many people.",
    "And a great many more of those promises have been found since his death, than the number of all the services which he conferred on and did to people during all the years that he was alive would amount to.",
    "But all those things I do not change, I do not meddle with.",
    "Nay, I defend all his good acts with the greatest earnestness.",
    "Would that the money remained in the temple of Opis!",
    "Bloodstained, indeed, it may be, but still needful at these times, since it is not restored to those to whom it really belongs.[7] Let that, however, be squandered too, if it is so written in his acts.",
    "Is there anything whatever that can be called so peculiarly the act of that man who, while clad in the robe of peace, was yet invested with both civil and military command in the republic, as a law of his?",
    "Ask for the acts of Gracchus, the Sempronian laws will be brought forward; ask for those of Sylla, you will have the Cornelian laws.",
    "What more?",
    "In what acts did the third consulship of Cnaeus Pompeius consist?",
    "Why, in his laws.",
    "And if you could ask Caesar himself what he had done in the city and in the garb of peace, he would reply that he had passed many excellent laws; but his memoranda he would either alter or not produce at all; or, if he did produce them, he would not class them among his acts.",
    "But, however, I allow even these things to pass for acts; at some things I am content to wink; but I think it intolerable that the acts of Caesar in the most important instances, that is to say, in his laws, are to be annulled for their sake.",
    "VIII.",
    "What law was ever better, more advantageous, more frequently demanded in the best ages of the republic, than the one which forbade the praetorian provinces to be retained more than a year, and the consular provinces more than two?",
    "If this law be abrogated, do you think that the acts of Caesar are maintained?",
    "What? are not all the laws of Caesar respecting judicial proceedings abrogated by the law which has been proposed concerning the third decury?",
    "And are you the defenders of the acts of Caesar who overturn his laws?",
    "Unless, indeed, anything which, for the purpose of recollecting it, he entered in a note-book, is to be counted among his acts, and defended, however unjust or useless it may be; and that which he proposed to the people in the comitia centuriata and carried, is not to be accounted one of the acts of Caesar.",
    "But what is that third decury?",
    "The decury of centurions, says he.",
    "What? was not the judicature open to that order by the Julian law, and even before that by the Pompeian and Aurelian laws?",
    "The income of the men, says he, was exactly defined.",
    "Certainly, not only in the case of a centurion, but in the case, too, of a Roman knight.",
    "Therefore, men of the highest honour and of the greatest bravery, who have acted as centurions, are and have been judges.",
    "I am not asking about those men, says he.",
    "Whoever has acted as centurion, let him be a judge.",
    "But if you were to propose a law, that whoever had served in the cavalry, which is a higher post, should be a judge, you would not be able to induce any one to approve of that; for a man's fortune and worth ought to be regarded in a judge.",
    "I am not asking about those points, says he; I am going to add as judges, common soldiers of the legion of Alaudae;[8] for our friends say, that that is the only measure by which they can be saved.",
    "Oh what an insulting compliment it is to those men whom you summon to act as judges though they never expected it!",
    "For the effect of the law is, to make those men judges in the third decury who do not dare to judge with freedom.",
    "And in that how great, O ye immortal gods!",
    "is the error of those men who have desired that law.",
    "For the meaner the condition of each judge is, the greater will be the severity of judgment with which he will seek to efface the idea of his meanness; and he will strive rather to appear worthy of being classed in the honourable decuries, than to have deservedly ranked in a disreputable one.",
    "IX.",
    "Another law was proposed, that men who had been condemned of violence and treason may appeal to the public if they please.",
    "Is this now a law, or rather an abrogation of all laws?",
    "For who is there at this day to whom it is an object that that law should stand?",
    "No one is accused under those laws; there is no one whom we think likely to be so accused.",
    "For measures which have been carried by force of arms will certainly never be impeached in a court of justice.",
    "But the measure is a popular one.",
    "I wish, indeed, that you were willing to promote any popular measure; for, at present, all the citizens agree with one mind and one voice in their view of its bearing on the safety of the republic.",
    "What is the meaning, then, of the eagerness to pass the law which brings with it the greatest possible infamy, and no popularity at all?",
    "For what can be more discreditable than for a man who has committed treason against the Roman people by acts of violence, after he has been condemned by a legal decision, to be able to return to that very course of violence, on account of which he has been condemned?",
    "But why do I argue any more about this law?",
    "as if the object aimed at were to enable any one to appeal?",
    "The object is, the inevitable consequence must be, that no one can ever be prosecuted under those laws.",
    "For what prosecutor will be found insane enough to be willing, after the defendant has been condemned, to expose himself to the fury of a hired mob?",
    "or what judge will be bold enough to venture to condemn a criminal, knowing that he will immediately be dragged before a gang of hireling operatives?",
    "It is not, therefore, a right of appeal that is given by that law, but two most salutary laws and modes of judicial investigation that are abolished.",
    "And what is this but exhorting young men to be turbulent, seditious, mischievous citizens?",
    "To what extent of mischief will it not be possible to instigate the frenzy of the tribunes now that these two rights of impeachment for violence and for treason are annulled?",
    "What more?",
    "Is not this a substitution of a new law for the laws of Caesar, which enact that every man who has been convicted of violence, and also every man who has been convicted of treason, shall be interdicted from fire and water?",
    "And, when those men have a right of appeal given them, are not the acts of Caesar rescinded?",
    "And those acts, O conscript fathers, I, who never approved of them, have still thought it advisable to maintain for the sake of concord, so that I not only did not think that the laws which Caesar had passed in his lifetime ought to be repealed, but I did not approve of meddling with those even which since the death of Caesar you have seen produced and published.",
    "X. Men have been recalled from banishment by a dead man; the freedom of the city has been conferred, not only on individuals, but on entire nations and provinces by a dead man; our revenues have been diminished by the granting of countless exemptions by a dead man.",
    "Therefore, do we defend these measures which have been brought from his house on the authority of a single, but, I admit, a very excellent individual, and as for the laws which he, in your presence, read, and declared, and passed,--in the passing of which he gloried, and on which he believed that the safety of the republic depended, especially those concerning provinces and concerning judicial proceedings,--can we, I say, we who defend the acts of Caesar, think that those laws deserve to be upset?",
    "And yet, concerning those laws which were proposed, we have, at all events, the power of complaining, but concerning those which are actually passed we have not even had that privilege.",
    "For they, without any proposal of them to the people, were passed before they were framed.",
    "Men ask, what is the reason why I, or why any one of you, O conscript fathers, should be afraid of bad laws while we have virtuous tribunes of the people?",
    "We have men ready to interpose their veto, ready to defend the republic with the sanctions of religion.",
    "We ought to be strangers to fear.",
    "What do you mean by interposing the veto? says he, what are all these sanctions of religion which you are talking about?",
    "Those, forsooth, on which the safety of the republic depends.",
    "We are neglecting those things, and thinking them too old-fashioned and foolish.",
    "The forum will be surrounded, every entrance of it will be blocked up, armed men will be placed in garrison, as it were, at many points.",
    "What then?--whatever is accomplished by those means will be law.",
    "And you will order, I suppose, all those regularly passed decrees to be engraved on brazen tablets \"The consuls consulted the people in regular form,\" (Is this the way of consulting the people that we have received from our ancestors?)",
    "\"and the people voted it with due regularity\" What people?",
    "that which was excluded from the forum?",
    "Under what law did they do so?",
    "under that which has been wholly abrogated by violence and arms?",
    "But I am saying all this with reference to the future, because it is the part of a friend to point out evils which may be avoided and if they never ensue, that will be the best refutation of my speech.",
    "I am speaking of laws which have been proposed, concerning which you have still full power to decide either way.",
    "I am pointing out the defects, away with them!",
    "I am denouncing violence and arms, away with them too!",
    "XI.",
    "You and your colleague, O Dolabella, ought not, indeed, to be angry with me for speaking in defence of the republic.",
    "Although I do not think that you yourself will be; I know your willingness to listen to reason.",
    "They say that your colleague, in this fortune of his, which he himself thinks so good, but which would seem to me more favourable if (not to use any harsh language)",
    "he were to imitate the example set him by the consulship of his grandfathers and of his uncle,--they say that he has been exceedingly offended.",
    "And I see what a formidable thing it is to have the same man angry with me and also armed; especially at a time when men can use their swords with such impunity.",
    "But I will propose a condition which I myself think reasonable, and which I do not imagine Marcus Antonius will reject.",
    "If I have said anything insulting against his way of life or against his morals, I will not object to his being my bitterest enemy.",
    "But if I have maintained the same habits that I have already adopted in the republic,--that is, if I have spoken my opinions concerning the affairs of the republic with freedom,--in the first place, I beg that he will not be angry with me for that; but, in the next place, if I cannot obtain my first request, I beg at least that he will show his anger only as he legitimately may show it to a fellow-citizen.",
    "Let him employ arms, if it is necessary, as he says it is, for his own defence: only let not those arms injure those men who have declared their honest sentiments in the affairs of the republic.",
    "Now, what can be more reasonable than this demand?",
    "But if, as has been said to me by some of his intimate friends, every speech which is at all contrary to his inclination is violently offensive to him, even if there be no insult in it whatever; then we will bear with the natural disposition of our friend.",
    "But those men, at the same time, say to me, \"You will not have the same licence granted to you who are the adversary of Caesar as might be claimed by Piso his father-in-law.\"",
    "And then they warn me of something which I must guard against; and certainly, the excuse which sickness supplies me with, for not coming to the senate, will not be a more valid one than that which is furnished by death.",
    "XII.",
    "But, in the name of the immortal gods!",
    "for while I look upon you, O Dolabella, who are most dear to me, it is impossible for me to keep silence respecting the error into which you are both falling; for I believe that you, being both men of high birth, entertaining lofty views, have been eager to acquire, not money, as some too credulous people suspect, a thing which has at all times been scorned by every honourable and illustrious man, nor power procured by violence and authority such as never ought to be endured by the Roman people, but the affection of your fellow-citizens, and glory.",
    "But glory is praise for deeds which have been done, and the fame earned by great services to the republic; which is approved of by the testimony borne in its favour, not only by every virtuous man, but also by the multitude.",
    "I would tell you, O Dolabella, what the fruit of good actions is, if I did not see that you have already learnt it by experience beyond all other men.",
    "What day can you recollect in your whole life, as ever having beamed on you with a more joyful light than the one on which, having purified the forum, having routed the throng of wicked men, having inflicted due punishment on the ringleaders in wickedness, and having delivered the city from conflagration and from fear of massacre, you returned to your house?",
    "What order of society, what class of people, what rank of nobles even was there who did not then show their zeal in praising and congratulating you?",
    "Even I, too, because men thought that you had been acting by my advice in those transactions, received the thanks and congratulations of good men in your name.",
    "Remember, I pray you, O Dolabella, the unanimity displayed on that day in the theatre, when every one, forgetful of the causes on account of which they had been previously offended with you, showed that in consequence of your recent service they had banished all recollection of their former indignation.",
    "Could you, O Dolabella, (it is with great concern that I speak,)--could you, I say, forfeit this dignity with equanimity?",
    "XIII.",
    "And you, O Marcus Antonius, (I address myself to you, though in your absence,) do you not prefer that day on which the senate was assembled in the temple of Tellus, to all those months during which some who differ greatly in opinion from me think that you have been happy?",
    "What a noble speech was that of yours about unanimity!",
    "From what apprehensions were the veterans, and from what anxiety was the whole state relieved by you on that occasion!",
    "when, having laid aside your enmity against him, you on that day first consented that your present colleague should be your colleague, forgetting that the auspices had been announced by yourself as augur of the Roman people; and when your little son was sent by you to the Capitol to be a hostage for peace.",
    "On what day was the senate ever more joyful than on that day?",
    "or when was the Roman people more delighted?",
    "which had never met in greater numbers in any assembly whatever.",
    "Then, at last, we did appear to have been really delivered by brave men, because, as they had willed it to be, peace was following liberty On the next day, on the day after that, on the third day, and on all the following days, you went on without intermission giving every day, as it were, some fresh present to the republic, but the greatest of all presents was that, when you abolished the name of the dictatorship.",
    "This was in effect branding the name of the dead Caesar with everlasting ignominy, and it was your doing,--yours, I say.",
    "For as, on account of the wickedness of one Marcus Manlius, by a resolution of the Manlian family it is unlawful that any patrician should be called Manlius, so you, on account of the hatred excited by one dictator, have utterly abolished the name of dictator.",
    "When you had done these mighty exploits for the safety of the republic, did you repent of your fortune, or of the dignity and renown and glory which you had acquired?",
    "Whence then is this sudden change?",
    "I cannot be induced to suspect that you have been caught by the desire of acquiring money; every one may say what he pleases, but we are not bound to believe such a thing; for I never saw anything sordid or anything mean in you.",
    "Although a man's intimate friends do sometimes corrupt his natural disposition, still I know your firmness; and I only wish that, as you avoid that fault, you had been able also to escape all suspicion of it.",
    "XIV.",
    "What I am more afraid of is lest, being ignorant of the true path to glory, you should think it glorious for you to have more power by yourself than all the rest of the people put together, and lest you should prefer being feared by your fellow-citizens to being loved by them.",
    "And if you do think so, you are ignorant of the road to glory.",
    "For a citizen to be dear to his fellow-citizens, to deserve well of the republic, to be praised, to be respected, to be loved, is glorious; but to be feared, and to be an object of hatred, is odious, detestable; and moreover, pregnant with weakness and decay.",
    "And we see that, even in the play, the very man who said, \"What care I though all men should hate my name, So long as fear accompanies their hate?\" found that it was a mischievous principle to act upon.",
    "I wish, O Antonius, that you could recollect your grand father of whom, however, you have repeatedly heard me speak.",
    "Do you think that he would have been willing to deserve even immortality, at the price of being feared in consequence of his licentious use of arms?",
    "What he considered life, what he considered prosperity, was the being equal to the rest of the citizens in freedom, and chief of them all in worth.",
    "Therefore, to say no more of the prosperity of your grandfather, I should prefer that most bitter day of his death to the domination of Lucius Cinna, by whom he was most barbarously slain.",
    "But why should I seek to make an impression on you by my speech?",
    "For, if the end of Caius Caesar cannot influence you to prefer being loved to being feared, no speech of any one will do any good or have any influence with you; and those who think him happy are themselves miserable.",
    "No one is happy who lives on such terms that he may be put to death not merely with impunity, but even to the great glory of his slayer.",
    "Wherefore, change your mind, I entreat you, and look back upon your ancestors, and govern the republic in such a way that your fellow-citizens may rejoice that you were born; without which no one can be happy nor illustrious.",
    "XV.",
    "And, indeed, you have both of you had many judgments delivered respecting you by the Roman people, by which I am greatly concerned that you are not sufficiently influenced.",
    "For what was the meaning of the shouts of the innumerable crowd of citizens collected at the gladiatorial games?",
    "or of the verses made by the people?",
    "or of the extraordinary applause at the sight of the statue of Pompeius?",
    "and at that sight of the two tribunes of the people who are opposed to you?",
    "Are these things a feeble indication of the incredible unanimity of the entire Roman people?",
    "What more?",
    "Did the applause at the games of Apollo, or, I should rather say, testimony and judgment there given by the Roman people, appear to you of small importance?",
    "Oh! happy are those men who, though they themselves were unable to be present on account of the violence of arms, still were present in spirit, and had a place in the breasts and hearts of the Roman people.",
    "Unless, perhaps, you think that it was Accius who was applauded on that occasion, and who bore off the palm sixty years after his first appearance, and not Brutus, who was absent from the games which he himself was exhibiting, while at that most splendid spectacle the Roman people showed their zeal in his favour though he was absent, and soothed their own regret for their deliverer by uninterrupted applause and clamour.",
    "I myself, indeed, am a man who have at all times despised that applause which is bestowed by the vulgar crowd, but at the same time, when it is bestowed by those of the highest, and of the middle, and of the lowest rank, and, in short, by all ranks together, and when those men who were previously accustomed to aim at nothing but the favour of the people keep aloof, I then think that, not mere applause, but a deliberate verdict.",
    "If this appears to you unimportant, which is in reality most significant, do you also despise the fact of which you have had experience,--namely, that the life of Aulus Hirtius is so dear to the Roman people?",
    "For it was sufficient for him to be esteemed by the Roman people as he is; to be popular among his friends, in which respect he surpasses everybody; to be beloved by his own kinsmen, who do love him beyond measure; but in whose case before do we ever recollect such anxiety and such fear being manifested?",
    "Certainly in no one's.",
    "What, then, are we to do?",
    "In the name of the immortal gods, can you interpret these facts, and see what is their purport?",
    "What do you think that those men think of your lives, to whom the lives of those men who they hope will consult the welfare of the republic are so dear?",
    "I have reaped, O conscript fathers, the reward of my return, since I have said enough to bear testimony of my consistency whatever event may befall me, and since I have been kindly and attentively listened to by you.",
    "And if I have such opportunities frequently without exposing both myself and you to danger, I shall avail myself of them.",
    "If not, as far as I can I shall reserve myself not for myself, but rather for the republic.",
    "I have lived long enough for the course of human life, or for my own glory.",
    "If any additional life is granted to me, it shall be bestowed not so much on myself as on you and on the republic.",
    "THE SECOND SPEECH OF M.T. CICERO AGAINST MARCUS ANTONIUS.",
    "CALLED ALSO THE SECOND PHILIPPIC.",
    "*",
    "* *",
    "* *",
    "THE ARGUMENT.",
    "This second speech was not actually spoken at all.",
    "Antonius was greatly enraged at the first speech, and summoned another meeting of the senate for the nineteenth day of the month, giving Cicero especial notice to be present, and he employed the interval in preparing an invective against Cicero, and a reply to the first Philippic.",
    "The senate met in the temple of Concord, but Cicero himself was persuaded not to attend by his friends, who were afraid of Antonius proceeding to actual violence against him, (and indeed he brought a strong guard of armed men with him to the senate)",
    "He spoke with the greatest fury against Cicero, charging him with having been the principal author and contriver of Caesar's murder, hoping by this to inflame the soldiers, whom he had posted within hearing of his harangue.",
    "Soon after this, Cicero removed to a villa near Naples for greater safety, and here he composed this second Philippic, which he did not publish immediately, but contented himself at first with sending a copy to Brutus and Cassius, who were much pleased with it.",
    "I.",
    "To what destiny of mine, O conscript fathers, shall I say that it is owing, that none for the last twenty years has been an enemy to the republic without at the same time declaring war against me?",
    "Nor is there any necessity for naming any particular person; you yourselves recollect instances in proof of my statement.",
    "They have all hitherto suffered severer punishments than I could have wished for them; but I marvel that you, O Antonius, do not fear the end of those men whose conduct you are imitating.",
    "And in others I was less surprised at this.",
    "None of those men of former times was a voluntary enemy to me; all of them were attacked by me for the sake of the republic.",
    "But you, who have never been injured by me, not even by a word, in order to appear more audacious than Catiline, more frantic than Clodius, have of your own accord attacked me with abuse, and have considered that your alienation from me would be a recommendation of you to impious citizens.",
    "What am I to think?",
    "that I have been despised?",
    "I see nothing either in my life, or in my influence in the city, or in my exploits, or even in the moderate abilities with which I am endowed, which Antonius can despise.",
    "Did he think that it was easiest to disparage me in the senate?",
    "a body which has borne its testimony in favour of many most illustrious citizens that they governed the republic well, but in favour of me alone, of all men, that I preserved it.",
    "Or did he wish to contend with me in a rivalry of eloquence?",
    "This, indeed, is an act of generosity; for what could be a more fertile or richer subject for me, than to have to speak in defence of myself, and against Antonius?",
    "This, in fact, is the truth.",
    "He thought it impossible to prove to the satisfaction of those men who resembled himself, that he was an enemy to his country, if he was not also an enemy to me.",
    "And before I make him any reply on the other topics of his speech, I will say a few words; respecting the friendship formerly subsisting between us, which he has accused me of violating,--for that I consider a most serious charge.",
    "II.",
    "He has complained that I pleaded once against his interest.",
    "Was I not to plead against one with whom I was quite I unconnected, in behalf of an intimate acquaintance, of a dear friend?",
    "Was I not to plead against interest acquired not by hopes of virtue, but by the disgrace of youth?",
    "Was I not to plead against an injustice which that man procured to be done by the obsequiousness of a most iniquitous interposer of his veto, not by any law regulating the privileges of the praetor?",
    "But I imagine that this was mentioned by you, in order that you might recommend yourself to the citizens, if they all recollected that you were the son-in-law of a freedman, and that your children were the grandsons of Quintus Fadius a freedman.",
    "But you had entirely devoted yourself to my principles; (for this is what you said;)",
    "you had been in the habit of coming to my house.",
    "In truth, if you had done so, you would more have consulted your own character and your reputation for chastity.",
    "But you did not do so, nor, if you had wished it, would Caius Curio have ever suffered you to do so.",
    "You have said, that you retired in my favour from the contest for the augurship.",
    "Oh the incredible audacity!",
    "oh the monstrous impudence of such an assertion!",
    "For, at the time when Cnaeus Pompeius and Quintus Hortensius named me as augur, after I had been wished for as such by the whole college, (for it was not lawful for me to be put in nomination by more than two members of the college,) you were notoriously insolvent, nor did you think it possible for your safety to be secured by any other means than by the destruction of the republic.",
    "But was it possible for you to stand for the augurship at a time when Curio was not in Italy?",
    "or even at the time when you were elected, could you have got the votes of one single tribe without the aid of Curio?",
    "whose intimate friends even were convicted of violence for having been too zealous in your favour.",
    "III.",
    "But I availed myself of your friendly assistance.",
    "Of what assistance?",
    "Although the instance which you cite I have myself at all times openly admitted.",
    "I preferred confessing that I was under obligations to you, to letting myself appear to any foolish person not sufficiently grateful.",
    "However, what was the kindness that you did me?",
    "not killing me at Brundusium?",
    "Would you then have slain the man whom the conqueror himself, who conferred on you, as you used to boast, the chief rank among all his robbers, had desired to be safe, and had enjoined to go to Italy?",
    "Grant that you could have slain him, is not this, O conscript fathers, such a kindness as is done by banditti, who are contented with being able to boast that they have granted their lives to all those men whose lives they have not taken?",
    "and if that were really a kindness, then these who slew that man by whom they themselves had been saved, and whom you yourself are in the habit of styling most illustrious men, would never have acquired such immortal glory.",
    "But what sort of kindness is it, to have abstained from committing nefarious wickedness?",
    "It is a case in which it ought not to appear so delightful to me not to have been killed by you, as miserable, that it should have been in your power to do such a thing with impunity.",
    "However, grant that it was a kindness, since no greater kindness could be received from a robber, still in what point can you call me ungrateful?",
    "Ought I not to complain of the ruin of the republic, lest I should appear ungrateful towards you?",
    "But in that complaint, mournful indeed and miserable, but still unavoidable for a man of that rank in which the senate and people of Rome have placed me, what did I say that was insulting?",
    "that was otherwise than moderate?",
    "that was otherwise than friendly?",
    "and what instance was it not of moderation to complain of the conduct of Marcus Antonius, and yet to abstain from any abusive expressions?",
    "especially when you had scattered abroad all relics of the republic; when everything was on sale at your house by the most infamous traffic; when you confessed that those laws which had never been promulgated, had been passed with reference to you, and by you; when you, being augur, had abolished the auspices; being consul, had taken away the power of interposing the veto; when you were escorted in the most shameful manner by armed guards; when, worn out with drunkenness and debauchery, you were every day performing all sorts of obscenities in that chaste house of yours.",
    "But I, as if I had to contend against Marcus Crassus, with whom I have had many severe struggles, and not with a most worthless gladiator, while complaining in dignified language of the state of the republic, did not say one word which could be called personal.",
    "Therefore, to-day I will make him understand with what great kindness he was then treated by me.",
    "IV.",
    "But he also read letters which he said that I had sent to him, like a man devoid of humanity and ignorant of the common usages of life.",
    "For who ever, who was even but slightly acquainted with the habits of polite men, produced in an assembly and openly read letters which had been sent to him by a friend, just because some quarrel had arisen between them?",
    "Is not this destroying all companionship in life, destroying the means by which absent friends converse together?",
    "How many jests are frequently put in letters, which, if they were produced in public, would appear stupid!",
    "How many serious opinions, which, for all that, ought not to be published!",
    "Let this be a proof of your utter ignorance of courtesy.",
    "Now mark, also, his incredible folly.",
    "What have you to oppose to me, O you eloquent man, as you seem at least to Mustela Tamisius, and to Tiro Numisius?",
    "And while these men are standing at this very time in the sight of the senate with drawn swords, I too will think you an eloquent man if you will show how you would defend them if they were charged with being assassins.",
    "However what answer would you make if I were to deny that I ever sent those letters to you?",
    "By what evidence could you convict me?",
    "by my handwriting?",
    "Of handwriting indeed you have a lucrative knowledge.[9]",
    "How can you prove it in that manner?",
    "for the letters are written by an amanuensis.",
    "By this time I envy your teacher, who for all that payment, which I shall mention presently, has taught you to know nothing.",
    "For what can be less like, I do not say an orator, but a man, than to reproach an adversary with a thing which if he denies by one single word, he who has reproached him cannot advance one step further?",
    "But I do not deny it; and in this very point I convict you not only of inhumanity but also of madness.",
    "For what expression is there in those letters which is not full of humanity and service and benevolence?",
    "and the whole of your charge amounts to this, that I do not express a bad opinion of you in those letters; that in them I wrote as to a citizen, and as to a virtuous man, not as to a wicked man and a robber.",
    "But your letters I will not produce, although I fairly might, now that I am thus challenged by you; letters in which you beg of me that you may be enabled by my consent to procure the recall of some one from exile; and you will not attempt it if I have any objection, and you prevail on me by your entreaties.",
    "For why should I put myself in the way of your audacity?",
    "when neither the authority of this body, nor the opinion of the Roman people, nor any laws are able to restrain you.",
    "However, what was the object of your addressing these entreaties to me, if the man for whom you were entreating was already restored by a law of Caesar's?",
    "I suppose the truth was, that he wished it to be done by me as a favour; in which matter there could not be any favour done even by himself, if a law was already passed for the purpose.",
    "V.",
    "But as, O conscript fathers, I have many things which I must say both in my own defence and against Marcus Antonius, one thing I ask you, that you will listen to me with kindness while I am speaking for myself; the other I will ensure myself, namely, that you shall listen to me with attention while speaking against him.",
    "At the same time also, I beg this of you; that if you have been acquainted with my moderation and modesty throughout my whole life, and especially as a speaker, you will not, when to-day I answer this man in the spirit in which he has attacked me, think that I have forgotten my usual character.",
    "I will not treat him as a consul, for he did not treat me as a man of consular rank; and although he in no respect deserves to be considered a consul, whether we regard his way of life, or his principle of governing the republic, or the manner in which he was elected, I am beyond all dispute a man of consular rank.",
    "That, therefore, you might understand what sort of a consul he professed to be himself, he reproached me with my consulship;--a consulship which, O conscript fathers, was in name, indeed, mine, but in reality yours.",
    "For what did I determine, what did I contrive, what did I do, that was not determined, contrived, or done, by the counsel and authority and in accordance with the sentiments of this order?",
    "And have you, O wise man, O man not merely eloquent, dared to find fault with these actions before the very men by whose counsel and wisdom they were performed?",
    "But who was ever found before, except Publius Clodius, to find fault with my consulship?",
    "And his fate indeed awaits you, as it also awaited Caius Curio; since that is now in your house which was fatal to each of them.[10] Marcus Antonius disapproves of my consulship; but it was approved of by Publius Servilius--to name that man first of the men of consular rank who had died most recently.",
    "It was approved of by Quintus Catulus, whose authority will always carry weight in this republic; it was approved of by the two Luculli, by Marcus Crassus, by Quintus Hortensius, by Caius Curio, by Caius Piso, by Marcus Glabrio, by Marcus Lepidus, by Lucius Volcatius, by Caius Figulus, by Decimus Silanus and Lucius Murena, who at that time were the consuls elect; the same consulship also which was approved of by those men of consular rank, was approved of by Marcus Cato; who escaped many evils by departing from this life, and especially the evil of seeing you consul.",
    "But, above all, my consulship was approved of by Cnaeus Pompeius, who, when he first saw me, as he was leaving Syria, embracing me and congratulating me, said, that it was owing to my services that he was about to see his country again.",
    "But why should I mention individuals?",
    "It was approved of by the senate, in a very full house, so completely, that there was no one who did not thank me as if I had been his parent, who did not attribute to me the salvation of his life, of his fortunes, of his children, and of the republic.",
    "VI.",
    "But, since the republic has been now deprived of those men whom I have named, many and illustrious as they were, let us come to the living, since two of the men of consular rank are still left to us: Lucius Cotta, a man of the greatest genius and the most consummate prudence, proposed a supplication in my honour for those very actions with which you find fault, in the most complimentary language, and those very men of consular rank whom I have named, and the whole senate, adopted his proposal; an honour which has never been paid to any one else in the garb of peace from the foundation of the city to my time.",
    "With what eloquence, with what firm wisdom, with what a weight of authority did Lucius Caesar your uncle, pronounce his opinion against the husband of his own sister, your stepfather.",
    "But you, when you ought to have taken him as your adviser and tutor in all your designs, and in the whole conduct of your life, preferred being like your stepfather to resembling your uncle.",
    "I, who had no connexion with him, acted by his counsels while I was consul.",
    "Did you, who were his sister's son, ever once consult him on the affairs of the republic?",
    "But who are they whom Antonius does consult?",
    "O ye immortal gods, they are men whose birthdays we have still to learn.",
    "To-day Antonius is not coming down.",
    "Why?",
    "He is celebrating the birthday feast at his villa.",
    "In whose honour?",
    "I will name no one.",
    "Suppose it is in honour of some Phormio, or Gnatho, or even Ballio.[11]",
    "Oh the abominable profligacy of the man!",
    "Oh how intolerable is his impudence, his debauchery, and his lust!",
    "Can you, when you have one of the chiefs of the senate, a citizen of singular virtue, so nearly related to you, abstain from ever consulting him on the affairs of the republic, and consult men who have no property whatever of their own, and are draining yours?",
    "VII.",
    "Yes, your consulship, forsooth, is a salutary one for the state, mine a mischievous one.",
    "Have you so entirely lost all shame as well as all chastity, that you could venture to say this in that temple in which I was consulting that senate which formerly in the full enjoyment of its honours presided over the world?",
    "And did you place around it abandoned men armed with swords?",
    "But you have dared besides (what is there which you would not dare?) to say that the Capitoline Hill, when I was consul, was full of armed slaves.",
    "I was offering violence to the senate, I suppose, in order to compel the adoption of those infamous decrees of the senate.",
    "O wretched man, whether those things are not known to you, (for you know nothing that is good,) or whether they are, when you dare to speak so shamelessly before such men!",
    "For what Roman knight was there, what youth of noble birth except you, what man of any rank or class who recollected that he was a citizen, who was not on the Capitoline Hill while the senate was assembled in this temple?",
    "who was there, who did not give in his name?",
    "Although there could not be provided checks enough, nor were the books able to contain their names.",
    "In truth, when wicked men, being compelled by the revelations of the accomplices, by their own handwriting, and by what I may almost call the voices of their letters, were confessing that they had planned the parricidal destruction of their country, and that they had agreed to burn the city, to massacre the citizens, to devastate Italy, to destroy the republic; who could have existed without being roused to defend the common safety?",
    "especially when the senate and people of Rome had a leader then; and if they had one now like he was then, the same fate would befall you which did overtake them.",
    "He asserts that the body of his stepfather was not allowed burial by me.",
    "But this is an assertion that was never made by Publius Clodius, a man whom, as I was deservedly an enemy of his, I grieve now to see surpassed by you in every sort of vice.",
    "But how could it occur to you to recal to our recollection that you had been educated in the house of Publius Lentulus?",
    "Were you afraid that we might think that you could have turned out as infamous as you are by the mere force of nature, if your natural qualities had not been strengthened by education?",
    "VIII.",
    "But you are so senseless that throughout the whole of your speech you were at variance with yourself; so that you said things which had not only no coherence with each other but which were most inconsistent with and contradictory to one another; so that there was not so much opposition between you and me as there was between you and yourself.",
    "You confessed that your stepfather had been duplicated in that enormous wickedness, yet you complained that he had had punishment inflicted on him.",
    "And by doing so you praised what was peculiarly my achievement, and blamed that which was wholly the act of the senate.",
    "For the detection and arrest of the guilty parties was my work, their punishment was the work of the senate.",
    "But that eloquent man does not perceive that the man against whom he is speaking is being praised by him, and that those before whom he is speaking are being attacked by him.",
    "But now what an act, I will not say of audacity, (for he is anxious to be audacious,) but (and that is what he is not desirous of) what an act of folly, in which he surpasses all men, is it to make mention of the Capitoline Hill, at a time when armed men are actually between our benches--when men, armed with swords, are now stationed in this same temple of Concord, O ye immortal gods, in which, while I was consul, opinions most salutary to the state were delivered, owing to which it is that we are all alive at this day.",
    "Accuse the senate; accuse the equestrian body, which at that time was united with the senate; accuse every order of society, and all the citizens, as long as you confess that this assembly at this very moment is besieged by Ityrean[12] soldiers.",
    "It is not so much a proof of audacity to advance these statements so impudently, as of utter want of sense to be unable to see their contradictory nature.",
    "For what is more insane than, after you yourself have taken up arms to do mischief to the republic, to reproach another with having taken them up to secure its safety?",
    "On one occasion you attempted even to be witty.",
    "O ye good gods, how little did that attempt suit you!",
    "And yet you are a little to be blamed for your failure in that instance, too.",
    "For you might have got some wit from your wife, who was an actress.",
    "\"Arms to the gown must yield.\"",
    "Well, have they not yielded?",
    "But afterwards the gown yielded to your arms.",
    "Let us inquire then whether it was better for the arms of wicked men to yield to the freedom of the Roman people, or that our liberty should yield to your arms.",
    "Nor will I make any further reply to you about the verses.",
    "I will only say briefly that you do not understand them, nor any other literature whatever.",
    "That I have never at any time been wanting to the claims that either the republic or my friends had upon me; but nevertheless that in all the different sorts of composition on which I have employed myself, during my leisure hours, I have always endeavoured to make my labours and my writings such as to be some advantage to our youth, and some credit to the Roman name.",
    "But, however, all this has nothing to do with the present occasion.",
    "Let us consider more important matters.",
    "IX.",
    "You have said that Publius Clodius was slain by my contrivance.",
    "What would men have thought if he had been slain at the time when you pursued him in the forum with a drawn sword, in the sight of all the Roman people; and when you would have settled his business if he had not thrown himself up the stairs of a bookseller's shop, and, shutting them against you, checked your attack by that means?",
    "And I confess that at that time I favoured you, but even you yourself do not say that I had advised your attempt.",
    "But as for Milo, it was not possible even for me to favour his action.",
    "For he had finished the business before any one could suspect that he was going to do it.",
    "Oh, but I advised it.",
    "I suppose Milo was a man of such a disposition that he was not able to do a service to the republic if he had not some one to advise him to do it.",
    "But I rejoiced at it.",
    "Well, suppose I did; was I to be the only sorrowful person in the city, when every one else was in such delight?",
    "Although that inquiry into the death of Publius Clodius was not instituted with any great wisdom.",
    "For what was the reason for having a new law to inquire into the conduct of the man who had slain him, when there was a form of inquiry already established by the laws?",
    "However, an inquiry was instituted.",
    "And have you now been found, so many years afterwards, to say a thing which, at the time that the affair was under discussion, no one ventured to say against me?",
    "But as to the assertion that you have dared to make, and that at great length too, that it was by my means that Pompeius was alienated from his friendship with Caesar, and that on that account it was my fault that the civil war was originated; in that you have not erred so much in the main facts, as (and that is of the greatest importance) in the times.",
    "X.",
    "When Marcus Bibulus, a most illustrious citizen, was consul, I omitted nothing which I could possibly do or attempt to draw off Pompeius from his union with Caesar.",
    "In which, however, Caesar was more fortunate than I, for he himself drew off Pompeius from his intimacy with me.",
    "But afterwards, when Pompeius joined Caesar with all his heart, what could have been my object in attempting to separate them then?",
    "It would have been the part of a fool to hope to do so, and of an impudent man to advise it.",
    "However, two occasions did arise, on which I gave Pompeius advice against Caesar.",
    "You are at liberty to find fault with my conduct on those occasions if you can.",
    "One was when I advised him not to continue Caesar's government for five years more.",
    "The other, when I advised him not to permit him to be considered as a candidate for the consulship when he was absent.",
    "And if I had been able to prevail on him in either of these particulars, we should never have fallen into our present miseries.",
    "Moreover, I also, when Pompeius had now devoted to the service of Caesar all his own power, and all the power of the Roman people, and had begun when it was too late to perceive all those things which I had foreseen long before, and when I saw that a nefarious war was about to be waged against our country, I never ceased to be the adviser of peace, and concord, and some arrangement.",
    "And that language of mine was well known to many people,--\"I wish, O Cnaeus Pompeius, that you had either never joined in a confederacy with Caius Caesar, or else that you had never broken it off.",
    "The one conduct would have become your dignity, and the other would have been suited to your prudence.\"",
    "This, O Marcus Antonius, was at all times my advice both respecting Pompeius and concerning the republic.",
    "And if it had prevailed, the republic would still be standing, and you would have perished through your own crimes, and indigence, and infamy.",
    "XI.",
    "But these are all old stories now.",
    "This charge, however, is quite a modern one, that Caesar was slain by my contrivance.",
    "I am afraid, O conscript fathers, lest I should appear to you to have brought up a sham accuser against myself (which is a most disgraceful thing to do); a man not only to distinguish me by the praises which are my due, but to load me also with those which do not belong to me.",
    "For who ever heard my name mentioned as an accomplice in that most glorious action?",
    "and whose name has been concealed who was in the number of that gallant band?",
    "Concealed, do I say?",
    "Whose name was there which was not at once made public?",
    "I should sooner say that some men had boasted in order to appear to have been concerned in that conspiracy, though they had in reality known nothing of it, than that any one who had been an accomplice in it could have wished to be concealed.",
    "Moreover, how likely it is, that among such a number of men, some obscure, some young men who had not the wit to conceal any one, my name could possibly have escaped notice!",
    "Indeed, if leaders were wanted for the purpose of delivering the country, what need was there of my instigating the Bruti, one of whom saw every day in his house the image of Lucius Brutus, and the other saw also the image of Ahala?",
    "Were these the men to seek counsel from the ancestors of others rather than from their own?",
    "and out of doors rather than at home?",
    "What?",
    "Caius Cassius, a man of that family which could not endure, I will not say the domination, but even the power of any individual,--he, I suppose, was in need of me to instigate him?",
    "a man who, even without the assistance of these other most illustrious men, would have accomplished this same deed in Cilicia, at the mouth of the river Cydnus, if Caesar had brought his ships to that bank of the river which he had intended, and not to the opposite one.",
    "Was Cnaeus Domitius spurred on to seek to recover his dignity, not by the death of his father, a most illustrious man, nor by the death of his uncle, nor by the deprivation of his own dignity, but by my advice and authority?",
    "Did I persuade Caius Trebonius?",
    "a man whom I should not have ventured even to advise.",
    "On which account the republic owes him even a larger debt of gratitude, because he preferred the liberty of the Roman people to the friendship of one man, and because he preferred overthrowing arbitrary power to sharing it.",
    "Was I the instigator whom Lucius Tillius Cimber followed?",
    "a man whom I admired for having performed that action, rather than ever expected that he would perform it; and I admired him on this account, that he was unmindful of the personal kindnesses which he had received, but mindful of his country.",
    "What shall I say of the two Servilii?",
    "Shall I call them Cascas, or Ahalas?",
    "and do you think that those men were instigated by my authority rather than by their affection for the republic?",
    "It would take a long time to go through all the rest; and it is a glorious thing for the republic that they were so numerous, and a most honourable thing also for themselves.",
    "XII.",
    "But recollect, I pray you, how that clever man convicted me of being an accomplice in the business.",
    "When Caesar was slain, says he, Marcus Brutus immediately lifted up on high his bloody dagger, and called on Cicero by name; and congratulated him on liberty being recovered.",
    "Why on me above all men?",
    "Because I knew of it beforehand?",
    "Consider rather whether this was not his reason for calling on me, that, when he had performed an action very like those which I myself had done, he called me above all men to witness that he had been an imitator of my exploits.",
    "But you, O stupidest of all men, do not you perceive, that if it is a crime to have wished that Caesar should be slain--which you accuse me of having wished--it is a crime also to have rejoiced at his death?",
    "For what is the difference between a man who has advised an action, and one who has approved of it?",
    "or what does it signify whether I wished it to be done, or rejoice that it has been done?",
    "Is there any one then, except you yourself and those men who wished him to become a king, who was unwilling that that deed should be done, or who disapproved of it after it was done?",
    "All men, therefore, are guilty as far as this goes.",
    "In truth, all good men, as far as it depended on them, bore a part in the slaying of Caesar.",
    "Some did not know how to contrive it, some had not courage for it, some had no opportunity,--every one had the inclination.",
    "However, remark the stupidity of this fellow,--I should rather say, of this brute beast.",
    "For thus he spoke:--\"Marcus Brutus, whom I name to do him honour, holding aloft his bloody dagger, called upon Cicero, from which it must be understood that he was privy to the action.\"",
    "Am I then called wicked by you because you suspect that I suspected something; and is he who openly displayed his reeking dagger, named by you that you may do him honour?",
    "Be it so.",
    "Let this stupidity exist in your language: how much greater is it in your actions and opinions!",
    "Arrange matters in this way at last, O consul; pronounce the cause of the Bruti, of Caius Cassius, of Cnaeus Domitius, of Caius Trebonius and the rest to be whatever you please to call it: sleep off that intoxication of yours, sleep it off and take breath.",
    "Must one apply a torch to you to waken you while you are sleeping over such an important affair?",
    "Will you never understand that you have to decide whether those men who performed that action are homicides or assertors of freedom?",
    "XIII.",
    "For just consider a little; and for a moment think of the business like a sober man.",
    "I who, as I myself confess, am an intimate friend of those men, and, as you accuse me, an accomplice of theirs, deny that there is any medium between these alternatives.",
    "I confess that they, if they be not deliverers of the Roman people and saviours of the republic, are worse than assassins, worse than homicides, worse even than parricides: since it is a more atrocious thing to murder the father of one's country, than one's own father.",
    "You wise and considerate man, what do you say to this?",
    "If they are parricides, why are they always named by you, both in this assembly and before the Roman people, with a view to do them honour?",
    "Why has Marcus Brutus[13] been, on your motion, excused from obedience to the laws, and allowed to be absent.",
    "Why were the games of Apollo celebrated with incredible honour to Marcus Brutus?",
    "why were provinces given to Brutus and Cassius?",
    "why were quaestors assigned to them?",
    "why was the number of their lieutenants augmented?",
    "And all these measures were owing to you.",
    "They are not homicides then.",
    "It follows that in your opinion they are deliverers of their country, since there can be no other alternative.",
    "What is the matter?",
    "Am I embarrassing you?",
    "For perhaps you do not quite understand propositions which are stated disjunctively.",
    "Still this is the sum total of my conclusion; that since they are acquitted by you of wickedness, they are at the same time pronounced most worthy of the very most honourable rewards.",
    "Therefore, I will now proceed again with my oration.",
    "I will write to them, if any one by chance should ask whether what you have imputed to me be true, not to deny it to any one.",
    "In truth, I am afraid that it must be considered either a not very creditable thing to them, that they should have concealed the fact of my being an accomplice; or else a most discreditable one to me that I was invited to be one, and that I shirked it.",
    "For what greater exploit (I call you to witness, O august Jupiter!) was ever achieved not only in this city, but in all the earth?",
    "What more glorious action was ever done?",
    "What deed was ever more deservedly recommended to the everlasting recollection of men?",
    "Do you, then, shut me up with the other leaders in the partnership in this design, as in the Trojan horse?",
    "I have no objection; I even thank you for doing so, with whatever intent you do it.",
    "For the deed is so great an one, that I cannot compare the unpopularity which you wish to excite against me on account of it, with its real glory.",
    "For who can be happier than those men whom you boast of having now expelled and driven from the city?",
    "What place is there either so deserted or so uncivilized, as not to seem to greet and to covet the presence of those men wherever they have arrived?",
    "What men are so clownish as not, when they have once beheld them, to think that they have reaped the greatest enjoyment that life can give?",
    "And what posterity will be ever so forgetful, what literature will ever be found so ungrateful, as not to cherish their glory with undying recollection?",
    "Enrol me then, I beg, in the number of those men.",
    "XIV.",
    "But one thing I am afraid you may not approve of.",
    "For if I had really been one of their number, I should have not only got rid of the king, but of the kingly power also out of the republic; and if I had been the author of the piece, as it is said, believe me, I should not have been contented with one act, but should have finished the whole play.",
    "Although, if it be a crime to have wished that Caesar might be put to death, beware, I pray you, O Antonius, of what must be your own case, as it is notorious that you, when at Narbo, formed a plan of the same sort with Caius Trebonius; and it was on account of your participation in that design that, when Caesar was being killed, we saw you called aside by Trebonius.",
    "But I (see how far I am from any horrible inclination towards,) praise you for having once in your life had a righteous intention; I return you thanks for not having revealed the matter; and I excuse you for not having accomplished your purpose.",
    "That exploit required a man.",
    "And if any one should institute a prosecution against you, and employ that test of old Cassius, \"who reaped any advantage from it?\" take care, I advise you, lest you suit that description.",
    "Although, in truth, that action was, as you used to say, an advantage to every one who was not willing to be a slave, still it was so to you above all men, who are not merely not a slave, but are actually a king; who delivered yourself from an enormous burden of debt at the temple of Ops; who, by your dealings with the account books, there squandered a countless sum of money; who have had such vast treasures brought to you from Caesar's house; at whose own house there is set up a most lucrative manufactory of false memoranda and autographs, and a most iniquitous market of lands, and towns, and exemptions, and revenues.",
    "In truth, what measure except the death of Caesar could possibly have been any relief to your indigent and insolvent condition?",
    "You appear to be somewhat agitated.",
    "Have you any secret fear that you yourself may appear to have had some connexion with that crime?",
    "I will release you from all apprehension; no one will ever believe it; it is not like you to deserve well of the republic; the most illustrious men in the republic are the authors of that exploit; I only say that you are glad it was done; I do not accuse you of having done it.",
    "I have replied to your heaviest accusations, I must now also reply to the rest of them.",
    "XV.",
    "You have thrown in my teeth the camp of Pompeius and all my conduct at that time.",
    "At which time, indeed, if, as I have said before, my counsels and my authority had prevailed, you would this day be in indigence, we should be free, and the republic would not have lost so many generals and so many armies.",
    "For I confess that, when I saw that these things certainly would happen, which now have happened, I was as greatly grieved as all the other virtuous citizens would have been if they had foreseen the same things.",
    "I did grieve, I did grieve, O conscript fathers, that the republic which had once been saved by your counsels and mine, was fated to perish in a short time.",
    "Nor was I so inexperienced in and ignorant of this nature of things, as to be disheartened on account of a fondness for life, which while it endured would wear me out with anguish, and when brought to an end would release me from all trouble.",
    "But I was desirous that those most illustrious men, the lights of the republic, should live: so many men of consular rank, so many men of praetorian rank, so many most honourable senators; and besides them all the flower of our nobility and of our youth; and the armies of excellent citizens.",
    "And if they were still alive, under ever such hard conditions of peace, (for any sort of peace with our fellow-citizens appeared to me more desirable than civil war,) we should be still this day enjoying the republic.",
    "And if my opinion had prevailed, and if those men, the preservation of whose lives was my main object, elated with the hope of victory, had not been my chief opposers, to say nothing of other results, at all events you would never have continued in this order, or rather in this city.",
    "But say you, my speech alienated from me the regard of Pompeius?",
    "Was there any one to whom he was more attached?",
    "any one with whom he conversed or shared his counsels more frequently?",
    "It was, indeed, a great thing that we, differing as we did respecting the general interests of the republic, should continue in uninterrupted friendship.",
    "But I saw clearly what his opinions and views were, and he saw mine equally.",
    "I was for providing for the safety of the citizens in the first place, in order that we might be able to consult their dignity afterwards.",
    "He thought more of consulting their existing dignity.",
    "But because each of us had a definite object to pursue, our disagreement was the more endurable.",
    "But what that extraordinary and almost godlike man thought of me is known to those men who pursued him to Paphos from the battle of Pharsalia.",
    "No mention of me was ever made by him that was not the most honourable that could be, that was not full of the most friendly regret for me; while he confessed that I had had the most foresight, but that he had had more sanguine hopes.",
    "And do you dare taunt me with the name of that man whose friend you admit that I was, and whose assassin you confess yourself?",
    "XVI.",
    "However, let us say no more of that war, in which you were too fortunate.",
    "I will not reply even with those jests to which you have said that I gave utterance in the camp.",
    "That camp was in truth full of anxiety, but although men are in great difficulties, still, provided they are men, they sometimes relax their minds.",
    "But the fact that the same man finds fault with my melancholy, and also with my jokes, is a great proof that I was very moderate in each particular.",
    "You have said that no inheritances come to me.",
    "Would that this accusation of yours were a true one; I should have more of my friends and connexions alive.",
    "But how could such a charge ever come into your head?",
    "For I have received more than twenty millions of sesterces in inheritances.",
    "Although in this particular I admit that you have been more fortunate than I.",
    "No one has ever made me his heir except he was a friend of mine, in order that my grief of mind for his loss might be accompanied also with some gain, if it was to be considered as such.",
    "But a man whom you never even saw, Lucius Rubrius, of Casinum, made you his heir.",
    "And see now how much he loved you, who, though he did not know whether you were white or black, passed over the son of his brother, Quintus Fufius, a most honourable Roman knight, and most attached to him, whom he had on all occasions openly declared his heir, (he never even names him in his will,) and he makes you his heir whom he had never seen, or at all events had never spoken to.",
    "I wish you would tell me, if it is not too much trouble, what sort of countenance Lucius Turselius was of; what sort of height; from what municipal town he came; and of what tribe he was a member.",
    "\"I know nothing,\" you will say, \"about him, except what farms he had.\"",
    "Therefore, he, disinheriting his brother, made you his heir.",
    "And besides these instances, this man has seized on much other property belonging to men wholly unconnected with him, to the exclusion of the legitimate heirs, as if he himself were the heir.",
    "Although the thing that struck me with most astonishment of all was, that you should venture to make mention of inheritances, when you yourself had not received the inheritance of your own father.",
    "XVII.",
    "And was it in order to collect all these arguments, O you most senseless of men, that you spent so many days in practising declamation in another man's villa?",
    "Although, indeed, (as your most intimate friends usually say,) you are in the habit of declaiming, not for the purpose of whetting your genius, but of working off the effects of wine.",
    "And, indeed, you employ a master to teach you jokes, a man appointed by your own vote and that of your boon companions; a rhetorician, whom you have allowed to say what ever he pleased against you, a thoroughly facetious gentleman; but there are plenty of materials for speaking against you and against your friends.",
    "But just see now what a difference there is between you and your grandfather.",
    "He used with great deliberation to bring forth arguments advantageous to the cause he was advocating; you pour forth in a hurry the sentiments which you have been taught by another.",
    "And what wages have you paid this rhetorician?",
    "Listen, listen, O conscript fathers, and learn the blows which are inflicted on the republic.",
    "You have assigned, O Antonius, two thousand acres[14] which is often translated acre also, of land, in the Leontine district, to Sextus Clodius, the rhetorician, and those, too, exempt from every kind of tax, for the sake of putting the Roman people to such a vast expense that you might learn to be a fool.",
    "Was this gift, too, O you most audacious of men, found among Caesar's papers?",
    "But I will take another opportunity to speak about the Leontine and the Campanian district; where he has stolen lands from the republic to pollute them with most infamous owners.",
    "For now, since I have sufficiently replied to all his charges, I must say a little about our corrector and censor himself.",
    "And yet I will not say all I could, in order that if I have often to battle with him I may always come to the contest with fresh arms; and the multitude of his vices and atrocities will easily enable me to do so.",
    "XVIII.",
    "Shall we then examine your conduct from the time when you were a boy?",
    "I think so.",
    "Let us begin at the beginning.",
    "Do you recollect that, while you were still clad in the praetexta, you became a bankrupt?",
    "That was the fault of your father, you will say.",
    "I admit that.",
    "In truth, such a defence is full of filial affection.",
    "But it is peculiarly suited to your own audacity, that you sat among the fourteen rows of the knights, though by the Roscian law there was a place appointed for bankrupts, even if any one had become so.",
    "XIX.",
    "But let us say no more of your profligacy and debauchery.",
    "There are things which it is not possible for me to mention with honour; but you are all the more free for that, inasmuch as you have not scrupled to be an actor in scenes which a modest enemy cannot bring himself to mention.",
    "Mark now, O conscript fathers, the rest of his life, which I will touch upon rapidly.",
    "For my inclination hastens to arrive at those things which he did in the time of the civil war, amid the greatest miseries of the republic, and at those things which he does every day.",
    "And I beg of you, though they are far better known to you than they are to me, still to listen attentively, as you are doing, to my relation of them.",
    "For in such cases as this, it is not the mere knowledge of such actions that ought to excite the mind, but the recollection of them also.",
    "Although we must at once go into the middle of them, lest otherwise we should be too long in coming to the end.",
    "He was very intimate with Clodius at the time of his tribuneship; he, who now enumerates the kindnesses which he did me.",
    "He was the firebrand to handle all conflagrations; and even in his house he attempted something.",
    "He himself well knows what I allude to.",
    "From thence he made a journey to Alexandria, in defiance of the authority of the senate, and against the interests of the republic, and in spite of religious obstacles; but he had Gabinius for his leader, with whom whatever he did was sure to be right.",
    "What were the circumstances of his return from thence?",
    "what sort of return was it?",
    "He went from Egypt to the furthest extremity of Gaul before he returned home.",
    "And what was his home?",
    "For at that time every man had possession of his own house; and you had no house anywhere, O Antonius.",
    "House, do you say?",
    "what place was there in the whole world where you could set your foot on anything that belonged to you, except Mienum, which you farmed with your partners, as if it had been Sisapo?[15] XX.",
    "You came from Gaul to stand for the quaestorship.",
    "Dare to say that you went to your own father before you came to me.",
    "I had already received Caesar's letters, begging me to allow myself to accept of your excuses; and therefore, I did not allow you even to mention thanks.",
    "After that, I was treated with respect by you, and you received attentions from me in your canvass for the quaestorship.",
    "And it was at that time, indeed, that you endeavoured to slay Publius Clodius in the forum, with the approbation of the Roman people; and though you made the attempt of your own accord, and not at my instigation, still you clearly alleged that you did not think, unless you slew him, that you could possibly make amends to me for all the injuries which you had done me.",
    "And this makes me wonder why you should say that Milo did that deed at my instigation; when I never once exhorted you to do it, who of your own accord attempted to do me the same service.",
    "Although, if you had persisted in it, I should have preferred allowing the action to be set down entirely to your own love of glory rather than to my influence.",
    "You were elected quaestor.",
    "On this, immediately, without any resolution of the senate authorizing such a step, without drawing lots, without procuring any law to be passed, you hastened to Caesar.",
    "For you thought the camp the only refuge on earth for indigence, and debt, and profligacy,--for all men, in short, who were in a state of utter ruin.",
    "Then, when you had recruited your resources again by his largesses and your own robberies, (if, indeed, a person can be said to recruit, who only acquires something which he may immediately squander,) you hastened, being again a beggar, to the tribuneship, in order that in that magistracy you might, if possible, behave like your friend.",
    "XXI.",
    "Listen now, I beseech you, O conscript fathers, not to those things which he did indecently and profligately to his own injury and to his own disgrace as a private individual; but to the actions which he did impiously and wickedly against us and our fortunes,--that is to say, against the whole republic.",
    "For it is from his wickedness that you will find that the beginning of all these evils has arisen.",
    "For when, in the consulship of Lucius Lentulus and Marcus Marcellus, you, on the first of January, were anxious to prop up the republic, which was tottering and almost falling, and were willing to consult the interests of Caius Caesar himself, if he would have acted like a man in his senses, then this fellow opposed to your counsels his tribuneship, which he had sold and handed over to the purchaser, and exposed his own neck to that axe under which many have suffered for smaller crimes.",
    "It was against you, O Marcus Antonius, that the senate, while still in the possession of its rights, before so many of its luminaries were extinguished, passed that decree which, in accordance with the usage of our ancestors, is at times passed against an enemy who is a citizen.",
    "And have you dared, before these conscript fathers, to say anything against me, when I have been pronounced by this order to be the saviour of my country, and when you have been declared by it to be an enemy of the republic?",
    "The mention of that wickedness of yours has been interrupted, but the recollection of it has not been effaced.",
    "As long as the race of men, as long as the name of the Roman people shall exist, (and that, unless it is prevented from being so by your means, will be everlasting,) so long will that most mischievous interposition of your veto be spoken of.",
    "What was there that was being done by the senate either ambitiously or rashly, when you, one single young man, forbade the whole order to pass decrees concerning the safety of the republic?",
    "and when you did so, not once only, but repeatedly?",
    "nor would you allow any one to plead with you in behalf of the authority of the senate; and yet, what did any one entreat of you, except that you would not desire the republic to be entirely overthrown and destroyed; when neither the chief men of the state by their entreaties, nor the elders by their warnings, nor the senate in a full house by pleading with you, could move you from the determination which you had already sold and as it were delivered to the purchaser?",
    "Then it was, after having tried many other expedients previously, that a blow was of necessity struck at you which had been struck at only few men before you, and which none of them had ever survived.",
    "Then it was that this order armed the consuls, and the rest of the magistrates who were invested with either military or civil command, against you, and you never would have escaped them, if you had not taken refuge in the camp of Caesar.",
    "XXII.",
    "It was you, you, I say, O Marcus Antonius, who gave Caius Caesar, desirous as he already was to throw everything into confusion, the principal pretext for waging war against his country.",
    "For what other pretence did he allege?",
    "what cause did he give for his own most frantic resolution and action, except that the power of interposition by the veto had been disregarded, the privileges of the tribunes taken away, and Antonius's rights abridged by the senate?",
    "I say nothing of how false, how trivial these pretences were; especially when there could not possibly be any reasonable cause whatever to justify any one in taking up arms against his country.",
    "But I have nothing to do with Caesar.",
    "You must unquestionably allow, that the cause of that ruinous war existed in your person.",
    "O miserable man if you are aware, more miserable still if you are not aware, that this is recorded in writings, is handed down to men's recollection, that our very latest posterity in the most distant ages will never forget this fact, that the consuls were expelled from Italy, and with them Cnaeus Pompeius, who was the glory and light of the empire of the Roman people; that all the men of consular rank, whose health would allow them to share in that disaster and that flight, and the praetors, and men of praetorian rank, and the tribunes of the people, and a great part of the senate, and all the flower of the youth of the city, and, in a word, the republic itself was driven out and expelled from its abode.",
    "As, then, there is in seeds the cause which produces trees and plants, so of this most lamentable war you were the seed.",
    "Do you, O conscript fathers, grieve that these armies of the Roman people have been slain?",
    "It is Antonius who slew them.",
    "Do you regret your most illustrious citizens?",
    "It is Antonius, again, who has deprived you of them.",
    "The authority of this order is overthrown; it is Antonius who has overthrown it.",
    "Everything, in short, which we have seen since that time, (and what misfortune is there that we have not seen?)",
    "we shall, if we argue rightly, attribute wholly to Antonius.",
    "As Helen was to the Trojans, so has that man been to this republic,--the cause of war, the cause of mischief, the cause of ruin.",
    "The rest of his tribuneship was like the beginning.",
    "He did everything which the senate had laboured to prevent, as being impossible to be done consistently with the safety of the republic.",
    "And see, now, how gratuitously wicked he was even in accomplishing his wickedness.",
    "XXIII.",
    "He restored many men who had fallen under misfortune.",
    "Among them no mention was made of his uncle.",
    "If he was severe, why was he not so to every one?",
    "If he was merciful, why was he not merciful to his own relations?",
    "But I say nothing of the rest.",
    "He restored Licinius Lenticula, a man who had been condemned for gambling, and who was a fellow-gamester of his own.",
    "As if he could not play with a condemned man; but in reality, in order to pay by a straining of the law in his favour, what he had lost by the dice.",
    "What reason did you allege to the Roman people why it was desirable that he should be restored?",
    "I suppose you said that he was absent when the prosecution was instituted against him; that the cause was decided without his having been heard in his defence; that there was not by a law any judicial proceeding established with reference to gambling; that he had been put down by violence or by arms; or lastly, as was said in the case of your uncle, that the tribunal had been bribed with money.",
    "Nothing of this sort was said.",
    "Then he was a good man, and one worthy of the republic.",
    "That, indeed, would have been nothing to the purpose, but still, since being condemned does not go for much, I would forgive you if that were the truth.",
    "Does not he restore to the full possession of his former privileges the most worthless man possible,--one who would not hesitate to play at dice even in the forum, and who had been convicted under the law which exists respecting gambling,--does not he declare in the most open manner his own propensities?",
    "Then in this same tribuneship, when Caesar while on his way into Spain had given him Italy to trample on, what journeys did he make in every direction!",
    "how did he visit the municipal towns!",
    "I know that I am only speaking of matters which have been discussed in every one's conversation, and that the things which I am saying and am going to say are better known to every one who was in Italy at that time, than to me, who was not.",
    "Still I mention the particulars of his conduct, although my speech cannot possibly come up to your own personal knowledge.",
    "When was such wickedness ever heard of as existing upon earth?",
    "or such shamelessness? or such open infamy?",
    "XXIV.",
    "The tribune of the people was borne along in a chariot, lictors crowned with laurel preceded him; among whom, on an open litter, was carried an actress; whom honourable men, citizens of the different municipalities, coming out from their towns under compulsion to meet him, saluted not by the name by which she was well known on the stage, but by that of Volumnia.[16]",
    "A car followed full of pimps; then a lot of debauched companions; and then his mother, utterly neglected, followed the mistress of her profligate son, as if she had been her daughter-in-law.",
    "O the disastrous fecundity of that miserable woman!",
    "With the marks of such wickedness as this did that fellow stamp every municipality, and prefecture, and colony, and, in short, the whole of Italy.",
    "To find fault with the rest of his actions, O conscript fathers, is difficult, and somewhat unsafe.",
    "He was occupied in war; he glutted himself with the slaughter of citizens who bore no resemblance to himself.",
    "He was fortunate--if at least there can be any good fortune in wickedness.",
    "But since we wish to show a regard for the veterans, although the cause of the soldiers is very different from yours; they followed their chief; you went to seek for a leader; still, (that I may not give you any pretence for stirring up odium against me among them,)",
    "I will say nothing of the nature of the war.",
    "When victorious, you returned with the legions from Thessaly to Brundusium.",
    "There you did not put me to death.",
    "It was a great kindness!",
    "For I confess that you could have done it.",
    "Although there was no one of those men who were with you at that time, who did not think that I ought to be spared.",
    "For so great is men's affection for their country, that I was sacred even in the eyes of your legions, because they recollected that the country had been saved by me.",
    "However, grant that you did give me what you did not take away from me; and that I have my life as a present from you, since it was not taken from me by you; was it possible for me, after all your insults, to regard that kindness of yours as I regarded it at first, especially after you saw that you must hear this reply from me?",
    "XXV.",
    "You came to Brundusium, to the bosom and embraces of your actress.",
    "What is the matter?",
    "Am I speaking falsely?",
    "How miserable is it not to be able to deny a fact which it is disgraceful to confess!",
    "If you had no shame before the municipal towns, had you none even before your veteran army?",
    "For what soldier was there who did not see her at Brundusium?",
    "who was there who did not know that she had come so many days' journey to congratulate you?",
    "who was there who did not grieve that he was so late in finding out how worthless a man he had been following?",
    "Again you made a tour through Italy, with that same actress for your companion.",
    "Cruel and miserable was the way in which you led your soldiers into the towns; shameful was the pillage in every city, of gold and silver, and above all, of wine.",
    "And besides all this, while Caesar knew nothing about it, as he was at Alexandria, Antonius, by the kindness of Caesar's friends, was appointed his master of the horse.",
    "Then he thought that he could live with Hippia[17] by virtue of his office, and that he might give horses which were the property of the state to Sergius the buffoon.",
    "At that time he had selected for himself to live in, not the house which he now dishonours, but that of Marcus Piso.",
    "Why need I mention his decrees, his robberies, the possessions of inheritances which were given him, and those too which were seized by him?",
    "Want compelled him; he did not know where to turn.",
    "That great inheritance from Lucius Rubrius, and that other from Lucius Turselius, had not yet come to him.",
    "He had not yet succeeded as an unexpected heir to the place of Cnaeus Pompeius, and of many others who were absent.",
    "He was forced to live like a robber, having nothing beyond what he could plunder from others.",
    "However, we will say nothing of these things, which are acts of a more hardy sort of villany.",
    "Let us speak rather of his meaner descriptions of worthlessness.",
    "You, with those jaws of yours, and those sides of yours, and that strength of body suited to a gladiator, drank such quantities of wine at the marriage of Hippia, that you were forced to vomit the next day in the sight of the Roman people.",
    "O action disgraceful not merely to see, but even to hear of!",
    "If this had happened to you at supper amid those vast drinking cups of yours, who would not have thought it scandalous?",
    "But in an assembly of the Roman people, a man holding a public office, a master of the horse, to whom it would have been disgraceful even to belch, vomiting filled his own bosom and the whole tribunal with fragments of what he had been eating reeking with wine.",
    "But he himself confesses this among his other disgraceful acts.",
    "Let us proceed to his more splendid offences.",
    "XXVI.",
    "Caesar came back from Alexandria, fortunate, as he seemed at least to himself; but in my opinion no one can be fortunate who is unfortunate for the republic.",
    "The spear was set up in front of the temple of Jupiter Stator, and the property of Cnaeus Pompeius Magnus--(miserable that I am, for even now that my tears have ceased to flow, my grief remains deeply implanted in my heart,)--the property, I say, of Cnaeus Pompeius the Great was submitted to the pitiless, voice of the auctioneer.",
    "On that one occasion the state forgot its slavery, and groaned aloud, and though men's minds were enslaved, as everything was kept under by fear, still the groans of the Roman people were free.",
    "While all men were waiting to see who would be so impious, who would be so mad, who would be so declared an enemy to gods and to men as to dare to mix himself up with that wicked auction, no one was found except Antonius, even though there were plenty of men collected round that spear[18] who would have dared anything else.",
    "One man alone was found to dare to do that which the audacity of every one else had shrunk from and shuddered at.",
    "Were you, then, seized with such stupidity,--or, I should rather say, with such insanity,--as not to see that if you, being of the rank in which you were born, acted as a broker at all, and above all as a broker in the case of Pompeius's property, you would be execrated and hated by the Roman people, and that all gods and all men must at once become and for ever continue hostile to you?",
    "But with what violence did that glutton immediately proceed to take possession of the property of that man, to whose valour it had been owing that the Roman people had been more terrible to foreign nations, while his justice had made it dearer to them.",
    "XXVII.",
    "When, therefore, this fellow had begun to wallow in the treasures of that great man, he began to exult like a buffoon in a play, who has lately been a beggar, and has become suddenly rich.",
    "But, as some poet or other says,-- \"Ill gotten gain comes quickly to an end.\"",
    "It is an incredible thing, and almost a miracle, how he in a few, not months, but days, squandered all that vast wealth.",
    "There was an immense quantity of wine, an excessive abundance of very valuable plate, much precious apparel, great quantities of splendid furniture, and other magnificent things in many places, such as one was likely to see belonging to a man who was not indeed luxurious, but who was very wealthy.",
    "Of all this in a few days there was nothing left.",
    "What Charybdis was ever so voracious?",
    "Charybdis, do I say?",
    "Charybdis, if she existed at all, was only one animal.",
    "The ocean, I swear most solemnly, appears scarcely capable of having swallowed up such numbers of things so widely scattered, and distributed in such different places, with such rapidity.",
    "Nothing was shut up, nothing sealed up, no list was made of anything.",
    "Whole storehouses were abandoned to the most worthless of men.",
    "Actors seized on this, actresses on that, the house was crowded with gamblers, and full of drunken men, people were drinking all day, and that too in many places, there were added to all this expense (for this fellow was not invariably fortunate) heavy gambling losses.",
    "You might see in the cellars of the slaves, couches covered with the most richly embroidered counterpanes of Cnaeus Pompeius.",
    "Wonder not, then, that all these things were so soon consumed.",
    "Such profligacy as that could have devoured not only the patrimony of one individual, however ample it might have been, (as indeed his was) but whole cities and kingdoms.",
    "And then his houses and gardens!",
    "Oh the cruel audacity!",
    "Did you dare to enter into that house?",
    "Did you dare to cross that most sacred threshold?",
    "and to show your most profligate countenance to the household gods who protect that abode?",
    "A house which for a long time no one could behold, no one could pass by without tears!",
    "Are you not ashamed to dwell so long in that house?",
    "one in which, stupid and ignorant as you are, still you can see nothing which is not painful to you.",
    "XXVIII.",
    "When you behold those beaks of ships in the vestibule, and those warlike trophies, do you fancy that you are entering into a house which belongs to you?",
    "It is impossible.",
    "Although you are devoid of all sense and all feeling,--as in truth you",
    "are,--still you are acquainted with yourself, and with your trophies, and with your friends.",
    "Nor do I believe that you either waking or sleeping, can ever act with quiet sense.",
    "It is impossible but that, were you ever so drunk and frantic,--as in truth you are,--when the recollection of the appearance of that illustrious man comes across you, you should be roused from sleep by your fears, and often stirred up to madness if awake.",
    "I pity even the walls and the roof.",
    "For what had that house ever beheld except what was modest, except what proceeded from the purest principles and from the most virtuous practice?",
    "For that man was, O conscript fathers, as you yourselves know, not only illustrious abroad, but also admirable at home; and not more praiseworthy for his exploits in foreign countries, than for his domestic arrangements.",
    "Now in his house every bedchamber is a brothel, and every dining-room a cookshop.",
    "Although he denies this:--Do not, do not make inquiries.",
    "He is become economical.",
    "He desired that mistress of his to take possession of whatever belonged to her, according to the laws of the Twelve Tables.",
    "He has taken his keys from her, and turned her out of doors.",
    "What a well-tried citizen!",
    "of what proved virtue is he!",
    "the most honourable passage in whose life is the one when he divorced himself from this actress.",
    "But how constantly does he harp on the expression \"the consul Antonius!\"",
    "This amounts to say \"that most debauched consul,\" \"that most worthless of men, the consul.\"",
    "For what else is Antonius?",
    "For if any dignity were implied in the name, then, I imagine, your grandfather would sometimes have called himself \"the consul Antonius.\"",
    "But he never did.",
    "My colleague too, your own uncle, would have called himself so.",
    "Unless you are the only Antonius.",
    "But I pass over those offences which have no peculiar connexion with the part you took in harassing the republic; I return to that in which you bore so principal a share,--that is, to the civil war; and it is mainly owing to you that that was originated, and brought to a head, and carried on.",
    "XXIX.",
    "Though you yourself took no personal share in it, partly through timidity, partly through profligacy, you had tasted, or rather had sucked in, the blood of fellow-citizens: you had been in the battle of Pharsalia as a leader; you had slain Lucius Domitius, a most illustrious and high-born man; you had pursued and put to death in the most barbarous manner many men who had escaped from the battle, and whom Caesar would perhaps have saved, as he did some others.",
    "And after having performed these exploits, what was the reason why you did not follow Caesar into Africa; especially when so large a portion of the war was still remaining?",
    "And accordingly, what place did you obtain about Caesar's person after his return from Africa?",
    "What was your rank?",
    "He whose quaestor you had been when general, whose master of the horse when he was dictator, to whom you had been the chief cause of war, the chief instigator of cruelty, the sharer of his plunder, his son, as you yourself said, by inheritance, proceeded against you for the money which you owed for the house and gardens, and for the other property which you had bought at that sale.",
    "At first you answered fiercely enough, and that I may not appear prejudiced against you in every particular, you used a tolerably just and reasonable argument.",
    "\"What, does Caius Caesar demand money of me?",
    "why should he do so, any more than I should claim it of him?",
    "Was he victorious without my assistance?",
    "No, and he never could have been.",
    "It was I who supplied him with a pretext for civil war, it was I who proposed mischievous laws, it was I who took up arms against the consuls and generals of the Roman people, against the senate and people of Rome, against the gods of the country, against its altars and healths, against the country itself.",
    "Has he conquered for himself alone?",
    "Why should not those men whose common work the achievement is, have the booty also in common?\"",
    "You were only claiming your right, but what had that to do with it?",
    "He was the more powerful of the two.",
    "Therefore, stopping all your expostulations, he sent his soldiers to you, and to your sureties, when all on a sudden out came that splendid catalogue of yours.",
    "How men did laugh!",
    "That there should be so vast a catalogue, that their should be such a numerous and various list of possessions, of all of which, with the exception of a portion of Misenum, there was nothing which the man who was putting them up to sale could call his own.",
    "And what a miserable sight was the auction.",
    "A little apparel of Pompeius's, and that stained, a few silver vessels belonging to the same man, all battered, some slaves in wretched condition, so that we grieved that there was anything remaining to be seen of these miserable relics.",
    "This auction, however, the heirs of Lucius Rubrius prevented from proceeding, being armed with a decree of Caesar to that effect.",
    "The spendthrift was embarrassed.",
    "He did not know which way to turn.",
    "It was at this very time that an assassin sent by him was said to have been detected with a dagger in the house of Caesar.",
    "And of this Caesar himself complained in the senate, inveighing openly against you.",
    "Caesar departs to Spain, having granted you a few days delay for making the payment, on account of your poverty.",
    "Even then you do not follow him.",
    "Had so good a gladiator as you retired from business so early?",
    "Can any one then fear a man who was as timid as this man in upholding his party, that is, in upholding his own fortunes?",
    "XXX.",
    "After some time he at last went into Spain; but, as he says, he could not arrive there in safety.",
    "How then did Dolabella manage to arrive there?",
    "Either, O Antonius, that cause ought never to have been undertaken, or when you had undertaken it, it should have been maintained to the end.",
    "Thrice did Caesar fight against his fellow-citizens; in Thessaly, in Africa, and in Spain.",
    "Dolabella was present at all these battles.",
    "In the battle in Spain he even received a wound.",
    "If you ask my opinion, I wish he had not been there.",
    "But still, if his design at first was blameable, his consistency and firmness were praiseworthy.",
    "But what shall we say of you?",
    "In the first place, the children of Cnaeus Pompeius sought to be restored to their country.",
    "Well, this concerned the common interests of the whole party.",
    "Besides that, they sought to recover their household gods, the gods of their country, their altars, their hearths, the tutelar gods of their family; all of which you had seized upon.",
    "And when they sought to recover those things by force of arms which belonged to them by the laws, who was it most natural--(although in unjust and unnatural proceedings what can there be that is natural?)--still, who was it most natural to expect would fight against the children of Cnaeus Pompeius?",
    "Who?",
    "Why, you who had bought their property.",
    "Were you at Narbo to be sick over the tables of your entertainers, while Dolabella was fighting your battles in Spain?",
    "And what a return was that of yours from Narbo?",
    "He even asked why I had returned so suddenly from my expedition.",
    "I have just briefly explained to you, O conscript fathers, the reason of my return.",
    "I was desirous, if I could, to be of service to the republic even before the first of January.",
    "For, as to your question, how I had returned; in the first place, I returned by daylight, not in the dark; in the second place, I returned in shoes, and in my Roman gown, not in any Gallic slippers, or barbarian mantle.",
    "And even now you keep looking at me; and, as it seems, with great anger.",
    "Surely you would be reconciled to me if you knew how ashamed I am of your worthlessness, which you yourself are not ashamed of.",
    "Of all the profligate conduct of all the world, I never saw, I never heard of any more shameful than yours.",
    "You who fancied yourself a master of the horse, when you were standing for, or I should rather say begging for the consulship for the ensuing year, ran in Gallic slippers and a barbarian mantle about the municipal towns and colonies of Gaul from which we used to demand the consulship when the consulship was stood for and not begged for.",
    "XXXI.",
    "But mark now the trifling character of the fellow.",
    "When about the tenth hour of the day he had arrived at Red Rocks, he skulked into a little petty wine-shop, and, hiding there, kept on drinking till evening.",
    "And from thence getting into a gig and being driven rapidly to the city, he came to his own house with his head veiled.",
    "\"Who are you?\" says the porter.",
    "\"An express from Marcus.\"",
    "He is at once taken to the woman for whose sake he had come; and he delivered the letter to her.",
    "And when she had read it with tears, (for it was written in a very amorous style, but the main subject of the letter was that he would have nothing to do with that actress for the future; that he had discarded all his love for her, and transferred it to his correspondent,) when she, I say, wept plentifully, this soft-hearted man could bear it no longer; he uncovered his head and threw himself on her neck.",
    "Oh the worthless man!",
    "(for what else can I call him?",
    "there is no more suitable expression for me to use,) was it for this that you disturbed the city by nocturnal alarms, and Italy with fears of many days' duration, in order that you might show yourself unexpectedly, and that a woman might see you before she hoped to do so?",
    "And he had at home a pretence of love; but out of doors a cause more discreditable still, namely, lest Lucius Plancus should sell up his sureties.",
    "But after you had been produced in the assembly by one of the tribunes of the people, and had replied that you had come on your own private business, you made even the people full of jokes against you.",
    "But, however, we have said too much about trifles.",
    "Let us come to more important subjects.",
    "XXXII.",
    "You went a great distance to meet Caesar on his return from Spain.",
    "You went rapidly, you returned rapidly in order that we might see that, if you were not brave, you were at least active.",
    "You again became intimate with him; I am sure I do not know how.",
    "Caesar had this peculiar characteristic; whoever he knew to be utterly ruined by debt, and needy, even if he knew him also to be an audacious and worthless man, he willingly admitted him to his intimacy.",
    "You then, being admirably recommended to him by these circumstances, were ordered to be appointed consul, and that too as his own colleague.",
    "I do not make any complaint against Dolabella, who was at that time acting under compulsion, and was cajoled and deceived.",
    "But who is there who does not know with what great perfidy both of you treated Dolabella in that business?",
    "Caesar induced him to stand for the consulship.",
    "After having promised it to him, and pledged himself to aid him, he prevented his getting it, and transferred it to himself.",
    "And you endorsed his treachery with your own eagerness.",
    "The first of January arrives.",
    "We are convened in the senate.",
    "Dolabella inveighed against him with much more fluency and premeditation than I am doing now.",
    "And what things were they which he said in his anger, O ye good gods!",
    "First of all, after Caesar had declared that before he departed he would order Dolabella to be made consul, (and they deny that he was a king who was always doing and saying something of this sort,)--but after Caesar had said this, then this virtuous augur said that he was invested with a pontificate of that sort that he was able, by means of the auspices, either to hinder or to vitiate the comitia, just as he pleased; and he declared that he would do so.",
    "And here, in the first place, remark the incredible stupidity of the man.",
    "For what do you mean?",
    "Could you not just as well have done what you said you had now the power to do by the privileges with which that pontificate had invested you, even if you were not an augur, if you were consul?",
    "Perhaps you could even do it more easily.",
    "For we augurs have only the power of announcing that the auspices are being observed, but the consuls and other magistrates have the right also of observing them whenever they choose.",
    "Be it so.",
    "You said this out of ignorance.",
    "For one must not demand prudence from a man who is never sober.",
    "But still remark his impudence.",
    "Many months before, he said in the senate that he would either prevent the comitia from assembling for the election of Dolabella by means of the auspices, or that he would do what he actually did do.",
    "Can any one divine beforehand what defect there will be in the auspices, except the man who has already determined to observe the heavens?",
    "which in the first place it is forbidden by law to do at the time of the comitia.",
    "And if any one has been observing the heavens, he is bound to give notice of it, not after the comitia are assembled, but before they are held.",
    "But this man's ignorance is joined to impudence, nor does he know what an augur ought to know, nor do what a modest man ought to do.",
    "And just recollect the whole of his conduct during his consulship from that day up to the ides of March.",
    "What lictor was ever so humble, so abject?",
    "He himself had no power at all; he begged everything of others; and thrusting his head into the hind part of his litter, he begged favours of his colleagues, to sell them himself afterwards.",
    "XXXIII.",
    "Behold, the day of the comitia for the election of Dolabella arrives.",
    "The prerogative century draws its lot.",
    "He is quiet.",
    "The vote is declared; he is still silent.",
    "The first class is called.[19] Its vote is declared.",
    "Then, as is the usual course, the votes are announced.",
    "Then the second class.",
    "And all this is done faster than I have told it.",
    "When the business is over, that excellent augur (you would say he must be Caius Laelius,) says,--\"We adjourn it to another day.\"",
    "Oh the monstrous impudence of such a proceeding!",
    "What had you seen?",
    "what had you perceived?",
    "what had you heard?",
    "For you did not say that you had been observing the heavens, and indeed you do not say so this day.",
    "That defect then has arisen, which you on the first of January had already foreseen would arise, and which you had predicted so long before.",
    "Therefore, in truth, you have made a false declaration respecting the auspices, to your own great misfortune, I hope, rather than to that of the republic.",
    "You laid the Roman people under the obligations of religion; you as augur interrupted an augur; you as consul interrupted a consul by a false declaration concerning the auspices.",
    "I will say no more, lest I should seem to be pulling to pieces the acts of Dolabella; which must inevitably sometime or other be brought before our college.",
    "But take notice of the arrogance and insolence of the fellow.",
    "As long as you please, Dolabella is a consul irregularly elected; again, while you please, he is a consul elected with all proper regard to the auspices.",
    "If it means nothing when an augur gives this notice in those words in which you gave notice, then confess that you, when you said,--\"We adjourn this to another day,\" were not sober.",
    "But if those words have any meaning, then I, an augur, demand of my colleague to know what that meaning is.",
    "But lest by any chance, while enumerating his numerous exploits, our speech should pass over the finest action of Marcus Antonius, let us come to the Lupercalia.",
    "XXXIV.",
    "He does not dissemble, O conscript fathers; it is plain that he is agitated; he perspires; he turns pale.",
    "Let him do what he pleases, provided he is not sick, and does not behave as he did in the Minucian colonnade.",
    "What defence can be made for such beastly behaviour?",
    "I wish to hear, that I may see the fruit of those high wages of that rhetorician, of that land given in Leontini.",
    "Your colleague was sitting in the rostra, clothed in purple robe, on a golden chair, wearing a crown.",
    "You mount the steps; you approach his chair; (if you were a priest of Pan, you ought to have recollected that you were consul too;)",
    "you display a diadem.",
    "There is a groan over the whole forum.",
    "Where did the diadem come from?",
    "For you had not picked it up when lying on the ground, but you had brought it from home with you, a premeditated and deliberately planned wickedness.",
    "You placed the diadem on his head amid the groans of the people; he rejected it amid great applause.",
    "You then alone, O wicked man, were found, both to advise the assumption of kingly power, and to wish to have him for your master who was your colleague; and also to try what the Roman people might be able to bear and to endure.",
    "Moreover, you even sought to move his pity; you threw yourself at his feet as a suppliant; begging for what?",
    "to be a slave?",
    "You might beg it for yourself, when you had lived in such a way from the time that you were a boy that you could bear everything, and would find no difficulty in being a slave; but certainly you had no commission from the Roman people to try for such a thing for them.",
    "Oh how splendid was that eloquence of yours, when you harangued the people stark naked!",
    "What could be more foul than this?",
    "more shameful than this?",
    "more deserving of every sort of punishment?",
    "Are you waiting for me to prick you more?",
    "This that I am saying must tear you and bring blood enough if you have any feeling at all.",
    "I am afraid that I may be detracting from the glory of some most eminent men.",
    "Still my indignation shall find a voice.",
    "What can be more scandalous than for that man to live who placed a diadem on a man's head, when every one confesses that that man was deservedly slain who rejected it?",
    "And, moreover, he caused it to be recorded in the annals, under the head of Lupercalia, \"That Marcus Antonius, the consul, by command of the people, had offered the kingdom to Caius Caesar, perpetual dictator; and that Caesar had refused to accept it.\"",
    "I now am not much surprised at your seeking to disturb the general tranquillity; at your hating not only the city but the light of day; and at your living with a pack of abandoned robbers, disregarding the day, and yet regarding nothing beyond the day.[20] For where can you be safe in peace?",
    "What place can there be for you where laws and courts of justice have sway, both of which",
    "you, as far as in you lay, destroyed by the substitution of kingly power? Was it for this that Lucius Tarquinius was driven out; that Spurius Cassius, and Spurius Maelius, and Marcus Manlius were slain; that many years afterwards a king might be established at Rome by Marcus Antonius, though the bare idea was impiety?",
    "However, let us return to the auspices.",
    "XXXV.",
    "With respect to all the things which Caesar was intending to do in the senate on the ides of March, I ask whether you have done anything?",
    "I heard, indeed, that you had come down prepared, because you thought that I intended to speak about your having made a false statement respecting the auspices, though it was still necessary for us to respect them.",
    "The fortune of the Roman people saved us from that day.",
    "Did the death of Caesar also put an end to your opinion respecting the auspices?",
    "But I have come to mention that occasion which must be allowed to precede those matters which I had begun to discuss.",
    "What a flight was that of yours!",
    "What alarm was yours on that memorable day!",
    "How, from the consciousness of your wickedness, did you despair of your life!",
    "How, while flying, were you enabled secretly to get home by the kindness of those men who wished to save you, thinking you would show more sense than you do!",
    "O how vain have at all times been my too true predictions of the future!",
    "I told those deliverers of ours in the Capitol, when they wished me to go to you to exhort you to defend the republic, that as long as you were in fear you would promise everything, but that as soon as you had emancipated yourself from alarm you would be yourself again.",
    "Therefore, while the rest of the men of consular rank were going backwards and forwards to you, I adhered to my opinion, nor did I see you at all that day, or the next; nor did I think it possible for an alliance between virtuous citizens and a most unprincipled enemy to be made, so as to last, by any treaty or engagement whatever.",
    "The third day I came into the temple of Tellus, even then very much against my will, as armed men were blockading all the approaches.",
    "What a day was that for you, O Marcus Antonius!",
    "Although you showed yourself all on a sudden an enemy to me; still I pity you for having envied yourself.",
    "XXXVI.",
    "What a man, O ye immortal gods!",
    "and how great a man might you have been, if you had been able to preserve the inclination you displayed that day;--we should still have peace which was made then by the pledge of a hostage, a boy of noble birth, the grandson of Marcus Bambalio.",
    "Although it was fear that was then making you a good citizen, which is never a lasting teacher of duty; your own audacity, which never departs from you as long as you are free from fear, has made you a worthless one.",
    "Although even at that time, when they thought you an excellent man, though I indeed differed from that opinion, you behaved with the greatest wickedness while presiding at the funeral of the tyrant, if that ought to be called a funeral.",
    "All that fine panegyric was yours, that commiseration was yours, that exhortation was yours.",
    "It was you--you, I say--who hurled those firebrands, both those with which your friend himself was nearly burnt, and those by which the house of Lucius Bellienus was set on fire and destroyed.",
    "It was you who let loose those attacks of abandoned men, slaves for the most part, which we repelled by violence and our own personal exertions; it was you who set them on to attack our houses.",
    "And yet you, as if you had wiped off all the soot and smoke in the ensuing days, carried those excellent resolutions in the Capitol, that no document conferring any exemption, or granting any favour, should be published after the ides of March.",
    "You recollect yourself, what you said about the exiles; you know what you said about the exemption; but the best thing of all was, that you for ever abolished the name of the dictatorship in the republic.",
    "Which act appeared to show that you had conceived such a hatred of kingly power that you took away all fear of it for the future, on account of him who had been the last dictator.",
    "To other men the republic now seemed established, but it did not appear so at all to me, as I was afraid of every sort of shipwreck, as long as you were at the helm.",
    "Have I been deceived?",
    "or, was it possible for that man long to continue unlike himself?",
    "While you were all looking on, documents were fixed up over the whole Capitol, and exemptions were being sold, not merely to individuals, but to entire states.",
    "The freedom of the city was also being given now not to single persons only, but to whole provinces.",
    "Therefore, if these acts are to stand,--and stand they cannot if the republic stands too,--then, O conscript fathers, you have lost whole provinces; and not the revenues only, but the actual empire of the Roman people has been diminished by a market this man held in his own house.",
    "XXXVII.",
    "Where are the seven hundred millions of sesterces which were entered in the account-books which are in the temple of Ops?",
    "a sum lamentable indeed, as to the means by which it was procured, but still one which, if it were not restored to those to whom it belonged, might save us from taxes.",
    "And how was it, that when you owed forty millions of sesterces on the fifteenth of March, you had ceased to owe them by the first of April?",
    "Those things are quite countless which were purchased of different people, not without your knowledge; but there was one excellent decree posted up in the Capitol affecting king Deiotarus, a most devoted friend to the Roman people.",
    "And when that decree was posted up, there was no one who, amid all his indignation, could restrain his laughter.",
    "For who ever was a more bitter enemy to another than Caesar was to Deiotarus?",
    "He was as hostile to him as he was to this order, to the equestrian order, to the people of Massilia, and to all men whom he knew to look on the republic of the Roman people with attachment.",
    "But this man, who neither present nor absent could ever obtain from him any favour or justice while he was alive, became quite an influential man with him when he was dead.",
    "When present with him in his house he had called for him though he was his host, he had made him give in his accounts of his revenue, he had exacted money from him; he had established one of his Greek retainers in his tetrarchy, and he had taken Armenia from him, which had been given to him by the senate.",
    "While he was alive he deprived him of all these things; now that he is dead, he gives them back again.",
    "And in what words?",
    "At one time he says, \"that it appears to him to be just, ...\" at another, \"that it appears not to be unjust....\"",
    "What a strange combination of words!",
    "But while alive, (I know this, for I always supported Deiotarus, who was at a distance,) he never said that anything which we were asking for, for him, appeared just to him.",
    "A bond for ten millions of sesterces was entered into in the women's apartment, (where many things have been sold, and are still being sold,) by his ambassadors, well-meaning men, but timid and inexperienced in business, without my advice or that of the rest of the hereditary friends of the monarch.",
    "And I advise you to consider carefully what you intend to do with reference to this bond.",
    "For the king himself, of his own accord, without waiting for any of Caesar's memoranda, the moment that he heard of his death, recovered his own rights by his own courage and energy.",
    "He, like a wise man, knew that this was always the law, that those men from whom the things which tyrants had taken away had been taken, might recover them when the tyrants were slain.",
    "No lawyer, therefore, not even he who is your lawyer and yours alone, and by whose advice you do all these things, will say that anything is due to you by virtue of that bond for those things which had been recovered before that bond was executed.",
    "For he did not purchase them of you; but, before you undertook to sell him his own property, he had taken possession of it.",
    "He was a man--we, indeed, deserve to be despised, who hate the author of the actions, but uphold the actions themselves.",
    "XXXVIII.",
    "Why need I mention the countless mass of papers, the innumerable autographs which have been brought forward?",
    "writings of which there are imitators who sell their forgeries as openly as if they were gladiators' playbills.",
    "Therefore, there are now such heaps of money piled up in that man's house, that it is weighed out instead of being counted.[21] But how blind is avarice!",
    "Lately, too, a document has been posted up by which the most wealthy cities of the Cretans are released from tribute; and by which it is ordained that after the expiration of the consulship of Marcus Brutus, Crete shall cease to be a province.",
    "Are you in your senses?",
    "Ought you not to be put in confinement?",
    "Was it possible for there really to be a decree of Caesar's exempting Crete after the departure of Marcus Brutus, when Brutus had no connexion whatever with Crete while Caesar was alive?",
    "But by the sale of this decree (that you may not, O conscript fathers, think it wholly ineffectual) you have lost the province of Crete.",
    "There was nothing in the whole world which any one wanted to buy that this fellow was not ready to sell.",
    "Caesar too, I suppose, made the law about the exiles which you have posted up.",
    "I do not wish to press upon any one in misfortune; I only complain, in the first place, that the return of those men has had discredit thrown upon it, whose cause Caesar judged to be different from that of the rest; and in the second place, I do not know why you do not mete out the same measure to all.",
    "For there can not be more than three or four left.",
    "Why do not they who are in similar misfortune enjoy a similar degree of your mercy?",
    "Why do you treat them as you treated your uncle?",
    "about whom you refused to pass a law when you were passing one about all the rest; and whom at the same time you encouraged to stand for the censorship, and instigated him to a canvass, which excited the ridicule and the complaint of every one.",
    "But why did you not hold that comitia?",
    "Was it because a tribune of the people announced that there had been an ill-omened flash of lightning seen?",
    "When you have any interest of your own to serve, then auspices are all nothing; but when it is only your friends who are concerned, then you become scrupulous.",
    "What more?",
    "Did you not also desert him in the matter of the septemvirate?[22] \"Yes, for he interfered with me.\"",
    "What were you afraid of?",
    "I suppose you were afraid that you would be able to refuse him nothing if he were restored to the full possession of his rights.",
    "You loaded him with every species of insult, a man whom you ought to have considered in the place of a father to you, if you had had any piety or natural affection at all.",
    "You put away his daughter, your own cousin, having already looked out and provided yourself beforehand with another.",
    "That was not enough.",
    "You accused a most chaste woman of misconduct.",
    "What can go beyond this?",
    "Yet you were not content with this.",
    "In a very full senate held on the first of January, while your uncle was present, you dared to say that this was your reason for hatred of Dolabella, that you had ascertained that he had committed adultery with your cousin and your wife.",
    "Who can decide whether it was more shameless of you to make such profligate and such impious statements against that unhappy woman in the senate, or more wicked to make them against Dolabella, or more scandalous to make them in the presence of her father, or more cruel to make them at all?",
    "XXXIX.",
    "However, let us return to the subject of Caesar's written papers.",
    "How were they verified by you?",
    "For the acts of Caesar were for peace's sake confirmed by the senate; that is to say, the acts which Caesar had really done, not those which Antonius said that Caesar had done.",
    "Where do all these come from?",
    "By whom are they produced and vouched for?",
    "If they are false, why are they ratified?",
    "If they are true, why are they sold?",
    "But the vote which was come to enjoined you, after the first of June, to make an examination of Caesar's acts with the assistance of a council.",
    "What council did you consult?",
    "Whom did you ever invite to help you?",
    "What was the first of June that you waited for?",
    "Was it that day on which you, having travelled all through the colonies where the veterans were settled, returned escorted by a band of armed men?",
    "Oh what a splendid progress of yours was that in the months of April and May, when you attempted even to lead a colony to Capua!",
    "How you made your escape from thence, or rather how you barely made your escape, we all know.",
    "And now you are still threatening that city.",
    "I wish you would try, and we should not then be forced to say \"barely.\"",
    "However, what a splendid progress of yours that was!",
    "Why need I mention your preparations for banquets, why your frantic hard-drinking?",
    "Those things are only an injury to yourself; these are injuries to us.",
    "We thought that a great blow was inflicted on the republic when the Campanian district was released from the payment of taxes, in order to be given to the soldiery; but you have divided it among your partners in drunkenness and gambling.",
    "I tell you, O conscript fathers, that a lot of buffoons and actresses have been settled in the district of Campania.",
    "Why should I now complain of what has been done in the district of Leontini?",
    "Although formerly these lands of Campania and Leontini were considered part of the patrimony of the Roman people, and were productive of great revenue, and very fertile.",
    "You gave your physician three thousand acres; what would you have done if he had cured you?",
    "and two thousand to your master of oratory; what would you have done if he had been able to make you eloquent?",
    "However, let us return to your progress, and to Italy.",
    "XL.",
    "You led a colony to Casilinum, a place to which Caesar had previously led one.",
    "You did indeed consult me by letter about the colony of Capua, (but I should have given you the same answer about Casilinum,) whether you could legally lead a new colony to a place where there was a colony already.",
    "I said that a new colony could not be legally conducted to an existing colony, which had been established with a due observance of the auspices, as long as it remained in a flourishing state; but I wrote you word that new colonists might be enrolled among the old ones.",
    "But you, elated and insolent, disregarding all the respect due to the auspices, led a colony to Casilinum, whither one had been previously led a few years before; in order to erect your standard there, and to mark out the line of the new colony with a plough.",
    "And by that plough you almost grazed the gate of Capua, so as to diminish the territory of that flourishing colony.",
    "After this violation of all religious observances, you hasten off to the estate of Marcus Varro, a most conscientious and upright man, at Casinum.",
    "By what right?",
    "with what face do you do this?",
    "By just the same, you will say, as that by which you entered on the estates of the heirs of Lucius Rubrius, or of the heirs of Lucius Turselius, or on other innumerable possessions.",
    "If you got the right from any auction, let the auction have all the force to which it is entitled; let writings be of force, provided they are the writings of Caesar, and not your own; writings by which you are bound, not those by which you have released yourself from obligation.",
    "But who says that the estate of Varro at Casinum was ever sold at all?",
    "who ever saw any notice of that auction?",
    "Who ever heard the voice of the auctioneer?",
    "You say that you sent a man to Alexandria to buy it of Caesar.",
    "It was too long to wait for Caesar himself to come!",
    "But whoever heard (and there was no man about whose safety more people were anxious) that any part whatever of Varro's property had been confiscated?",
    "What?",
    "what shall we say if Caesar even wrote you that you were to give it up?",
    "What can be said strong enough for such enormous impudence?",
    "Remove for a while those swords which we see around us.",
    "You shall now see that the cause of Caesar's auctions is one thing, and that of your confidence and rashness is another.",
    "For not only shall the owner drive you from that estate, but any one of his friends, or neighbours, or hereditary connexions, and any agent, will have the right to do so.",
    "XLI.",
    "But how many days did he spend revelling in the most scandalous manner in that villa!",
    "From the third hour there was one scene of drinking, gambling, and vomiting.",
    "Alas for the unhappy house itself!",
    "how different a master from its former one has it fallen to the share of!",
    "Although, how is he the master at all?",
    "but still by how different a person has it been occupied!",
    "For Marcus Varro used it as a place of retirement for his studies, not as a theatre for his lusts.",
    "What noble discussions used to take place in that villa!",
    "what ideas were originated there!",
    "what writings were composed there!",
    "The laws of the Roman people, the memorials of our ancestors, the consideration of all wisdom, and all learning, were the topics that used to be dwelt on then;--but now, while you were the intruder there, (for I will not call you the master,) every place was resounding with the voices of drunken men; the pavements were floating with wine; the walls were dripping; nobly-born boys were mixing with the basest hirelings; prostitutes with mothers of families.",
    "Men came from Casinum, from Aquinum, from Interamna to salute him.",
    "No one was admitted.",
    "That, indeed, was proper.",
    "For the ordinary marks of respect were unsuited to the most profligate of men.",
    "When going from thence to Rome he approached Aquinum, a pretty numerous company (for it is a populous municipality) came out to meet him.",
    "But he was carried through the town in a covered litter, as if he had been dead.",
    "The people of Aquinum acted foolishly, no doubt; but still they were in his road.",
    "What did the people of Anagnia do?",
    "who, although they were out of his line of road, came down to meet him, in order to pay him their respects, as if he were consul.",
    "It is an incredible thing to say, but still it was only too notorious at the time, that he returned nobody's salutation; especially as he had two men of Anagnia with him, Mustela and Laco; one of whom had the care of his swords, and the other of his drinking cups.",
    "Why should I mention the threats and insults with which he inveighed against the people of Teanum Sidicinum, with which he harassed the men of Puteoli, because they had adopted Caius Cassius and the Bruti as their patrons?",
    "a choice dictated, in truth, by great wisdom, and great zeal, benevolence, and affection for them; not by violence and force of arms, by which men have been compelled to choose you, and Basilus, and others like you both,--men whom no one would choose to have for his own clients, much less to be their client himself.",
    "XLII.",
    "In the mean time, while you yourself were absent, what a day was that for your colleague when he overturned that tomb in the forum, which you were accustomed to regard with veneration!",
    "And when that action was announced to you, you--as is agreed upon by all who were with you at the time--fainted away.",
    "What happened afterwards I know not.",
    "I imagine that terror and arms got the mastery.",
    "At all events, you dragged your colleague down from his heaven; and you rendered him, not even now like yourself, but at all events very unlike his own former self.",
    "After that what a return was that of yours to Rome!",
    "How great was the agitation of the whole city!",
    "We recollected Cinna being too powerful; after him we had seen Sylla with absolute authority, and we had lately beheld Caesar acting as king.",
    "There were perhaps swords, but they were sheathed, and they were not very numerous.",
    "But how great and how barbaric a procession is yours!",
    "Men follow you in battle array with drawn swords; we see whole litters full of shields borne along.",
    "And yet by custom, O conscript fathers, we have become inured and callous to these things.",
    "When on the first of June we wished to come to the senate, as it had been ordained, we were suddenly frightened and forced to flee.",
    "But he, as having no need of a senate, did not miss any of us, and rather rejoiced at our departure, and immediately proceeded to those marvellous exploits of his.",
    "He who had defended the memoranda of Caesar for the sake of his own profit, overturned the laws of Caesar--and good laws too--for the sake of being able to agitate the republic.",
    "He increased the number of years that magistrates were to enjoy their provinces; moreover, though he was bound to be the defender of the acts of Caesar, he rescinded them both with reference to public and private transactions.",
    "In public transactions nothing is more authoritative than law; in private affairs the most valid of all deeds is a will.",
    "Of the laws, some he abolished without giving the least notice; others he gave notice of bills to abolish.",
    "Wills he annulled; though they have been at all times held sacred even in the case of the very meanest of the citizens.",
    "As for the statues and pictures which Caesar bequeathed to the people, together with his gardens, those he carried away, some to the house which belonged to Pompeius, and some to Scipio's villa.",
    "XLIII.",
    "And are you then diligent in doing honour to Caesar's memory?",
    "Do you love him even now that he is dead?",
    "What greater honour had he obtained than that of having a holy cushion, an image, a temple, and a priest?",
    "As then Jupiter, and Mars, and Quirinus have priests, so Marcus Antonius is the priest of the god Julius.",
    "Why then do you delay?",
    "why are not you inaugurated?",
    "Choose a day; select some one to inaugurate you; we are colleagues; no one will refuse O you detestable man, whether you are the priest of a tyrant, or of a dead man!",
    "I ask you then, whether you are ignorant what day this is?",
    "Are you ignorant that yesterday was the fourth day of the Roman games in the Circus?",
    "and that you yourself submitted a motion to the people, that a fifth day should be added besides, in honour of Caesar?",
    "Why are we not all clad in the praetexta?",
    "Why are we permitting the honour which by your law was appointed for Caesar to be deserted?",
    "Had you no objection to so holy a day being polluted by the addition of supplications, while you did not choose it to be so by the addition of ceremonies connected with a sacred cushion?",
    "Either take away religion in every case, or preserve it in every case.",
    "You will ask whether I approve of his having a sacred cushion, a temple and a priest?",
    "I approve of none of those things.",
    "But you, who are defending the acts of Caesar, what reason can you give for defending some, and disregarding others?",
    "unless, indeed, you choose to admit that you measure everything by your own gain, and not by his dignity.",
    "What will you now reply to these arguments?--(for I am waiting to witness your eloquence; I knew your grandfather, who was a most eloquent man, but I know you to be a more undisguised speaker than he was; he never harangued the people naked; but we have seen your breast, man, without disguise as you are.)",
    "Will you make any reply to these statements?",
    "will you dare to open your mouth at all?",
    "Can you find one single article in this long speech of mine, to which you trust that you can make any answer?",
    "However, we will say no more of what is past.",
    "XLIV.",
    "But this single day, this very day that now is, this very moment while I am speaking, defend your conduct during this very moment, if you can.",
    "Why has the senate been surrounded with a belt of armed men?",
    "Why are your satellites listening to me sword in hand?",
    "Why are not the folding-doors of the temple of Concord open?",
    "Why do you bring men of all nations the most barbarous, Ityreans, armed with arrows, into the forum?",
    "He says, that he does so as a guard.",
    "Is it not then better to perish a thousand times than to be unable to live in one's own city without a guard of armed men?",
    "But believe me, there is no protection in that;--a man must be defended by the affection and good-will of his fellow citizens, not by arms.",
    "The Roman people will take them from you, will wrest them from your hands, I wish that they may do so while we are still safe.",
    "But however you treat us, as long as you adopt those counsels, it is impossible for you, believe me, to last long.",
    "In truth, that wife of yours, who is so far removed from covetousness, and whom I mention without intending any slight to her, has been too long owing[23] her third payment to the state.",
    "The Roman people has men to whom it can entrust the helm of the state, and wherever they are, there is all the defence of the republic, or rather, there is the republic itself, which as yet has only avenged, but has not reestablished itself.",
    "Truly and surely has the republic most high born youths ready to defend it,--though they may for a time keep in the background from a desire for tranquillity, still they can be recalled by the republic at any time.",
    "The name of peace is sweet, the thing itself is most salutary.",
    "But between peace and slavery there is a wide difference.",
    "Peace is liberty in tranquillity, slavery is the worst of all evils,--to be repelled, if need be, not only by war, but even by death.",
    "But if those deliverers of ours have taken themselves away out of our sight, still they have left behind the example of their conduct.",
    "They have done what no one else had done.",
    "Brutus pursued Tarquinius with war, who was a king when it was lawful for a king to exist in Rome.",
    "Spurius Cassius, Spurius Maelius, and Marcus Manlius were all slain because they were suspected of aiming at regal power.",
    "These are the first men who have ever ventured to attack, sword in hand, a man who was not aiming at regal power, but actually reigning.",
    "And their action is not only of itself a glorious and godlike exploit, but it is also one put forth for our imitation, especially since by it they have acquired such glory as appears hardly to be bounded by heaven itself.",
    "For although in the very consciousness of a glorious action there is a certain reward, still I do not consider immortality of glory a thing to be despised by one who is himself mortal.",
    "XLV.",
    "Recollect then, O Marcus Antonius, that day on which you abolished the dictatorship.",
    "Set before you the joy of the senate and people of Rome, compare it with this infamous market held by you and by your friends, and then you will understand how great is the difference between praise and profit.",
    "But in truth, just as some people, through some disease which has blunted the senses, have no conception of the niceness of food, so men who are lustful, avaricious, and criminal, have no taste for true glory.",
    "But if praise cannot allure you to act rightly, still cannot even fear turn you away from the most shameful actions?",
    "You are not afraid of the courts of justice.",
    "If it is because you are innocent I praise you, if because you trust in your power of overbearing them by violence, are you ignorant of what that man has to fear, who on such an account as that does not fear the courts of justice?",
    "But if you are not afraid of brave men and illustrious citizens, because they are prevented from attacking you by your armed retinue, still, believe me, your own fellows will not long endure you.",
    "And what a life is it, day and night to be fearing danger from one's own people!",
    "Unless, indeed, you have men who are bound to you by greater kindnesses than some of those men by whom he was slain were bound to Caesar, or unless there are points in which you can be compared with him.",
    "In that man were combined genius, method, memory, literature, prudence, deliberation, and industry.",
    "He had performed exploits in war which, though calamitous for the republic, were nevertheless mighty deeds.",
    "Having for many years aimed at being a king, he had with great labour, and much personal danger, accomplished what he intended.",
    "He had conciliated the ignorant multitude by presents, by monuments, by largesses of food, and by banquets, he had bound his own party to him by rewards, his adversaries by the appearances of clemency.",
    "Why need I say much on such a subject?",
    "He had already brought a free city, partly by fear, partly by patience, into a habit of slavery.",
    "XLVI.",
    "With him I can, indeed, compare you as to your desire to reign, but in all other respects you are in no degree to be compared to him.",
    "But from the many evils which by him have been burnt into the republic, there is still this good, that the Roman people has now learnt how much to believe every one, to whom to trust itself, and against whom to guard.",
    "Do you never think on these things?",
    "And do you not understand that it is enough for brave men to have learnt how noble a thing it is as to the act, how grateful it is as to the benefit done, how glorious as to the fame acquired, to slay a tyrant?",
    "When men could not bear him, do you think they will bear you?",
    "Believe me, the time will come when men will race with one another to do this deed, and when no one will wait for the tardy arrival of an opportunity.",
    "Consider, I beg you, Marcus Antonius, do some time or other consider the republic: think of the family of which you are born, not of the men with whom you are living.",
    "Be reconciled to the republic.",
    "However, do you decide on your conduct.",
    "As to mine, I myself will declare what that shall be.",
    "I defended the republic as a young man, I will not abandon it now that I am old.",
    "I scorned the sword of Catiline, I will not quail before yours.",
    "No, I will rather cheerfully expose my own person, if the liberty of the city can be restored by my death.",
    "May the indignation of the Roman people at last bring forth what it has been so long labouring with.",
    "In truth, if twenty years ago in this very temple I asserted that death could not come prematurely upon a man of consular rank, with how much more truth must I now say the same of an old man?",
    "To me, indeed, O conscript fathers, death is now even desirable, after all the honours which I have gained, and the deeds which I have done.",
    "I only pray for these two things: one, that dying I may leave the Roman people free.",
    "No greater boon than this can be granted me by the immortal gods.",
    "The other, that every one may meet with a fate suitable to his deserts and conduct towards the republic.",
    "THE THIRD PHILIPPIC, OR THIRD SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO AGAINST MARCUS ANTONIUS.",
    "THE ARGUMENT.",
    "After the composition of the last speech, Octavius, considering that he had reason to be offended with Antonius, formed a plot for his assassination by means of some slaves, which however was discovered.",
    "In the mean time Antonius began to declare more and more openly against the conspirators.",
    "He erected a statue in the forum to Caesar, with the inscription, \"To the most worthy Defender of his Country.\"",
    "Octavius at the same time was trying to win over the soldiers of his uncle Julius, and out-bidding Antonius in all his promises to them, so that he soon collected a formidable army of veterans.",
    "But as he had no public office to give him any colour for this conduct, he paid great court to the republican party, in hopes to get his proceedings authorized by the senate; and he kept continually pressing Cicero to return to Rome and support him.",
    "Cicero, however, for some time kept aloof, suspecting partly his abilities, on account of his exceeding youth, and partly his sincerity in reconciling himself to his uncle's murderers; however, at last he returned, after expressly stipulating that Octavius should employ all his forces in defence of Brutus and his accomplices.",
    "Antonius left Rome about the end of September, in order to engage in his service four legions of Caesar's, which were on their return from Macedonia.",
    "But when they arrived at Brundusium three of them refused to follow him, on which he murdered all their centurions, to the number of three hundred, who were all put to death in his lodgings, in the sight of himself and Fulvia his wife, and then returned to Rome with the one legion which he had prevailed on; while the other three legions declared as yet for neither party.",
    "On his arrival in Rome he published many very violent edicts, and summoned the senate to meet on the twenty-fourth of October; then he adjourned it to the twenty-eighth; and a day or two before it met, he heard that two out of the three legions had declared for Octavius, and encamped at Alba.",
    "And this news alarmed him so much, that he abandoned his intention of proposing to the senate a decree to declare Octavius a public enemy, and after distributing some provinces among his friends, he put on his military robes, and left the city to take possession of Cisalpine Gaul, which had been assigned to him by a pretended law of the people, against the will of the senate.",
    "On the news of his departure Cicero returned to Rome, where he arrived on the ninth of December.",
    "He immediately conferred with Pansa, one of the consuls elect, (Hirtius his colleague was ill,) as to the measures to be taken.",
    "He was again addressed with earnest solicitations by the friends of Octavius, who, to confirm his belief in his good intentions, allowed Casca, who had been one of the slayers of Caesar, and had himself given him the first blow, to enter on his office as tribune of the people on the tenth of December.",
    "The new tribunes convoked the senate for the nineteenth, on which occasion Cicero had intended to be absent, but receiving the day before the edict of Decimus Brutus, by which he forbade Antonius to enter his province (immediately after the death of Caesar he had taken possession of Cisalpine Gaul, which had been conferred on him by Caesar), and declared that he would defend it against him by force and preserve it in its duty to the senate, he thought it necessary to procure for Brutus a resolution of the senate in his favour.",
    "He went down therefore very early, and, in a very full house, delivered the following speech.",
    "I.",
    "We have been assembled at length, O conscript fathers, altogether later than the necessities of the republic required; but still we are assembled, a measure which I, indeed, have been every day demanding, inasmuch as I saw that a nefarious war against our altars and our hearths, against our lives and our fortunes was, I will not say being prepared, but being actually waged by a profligate and desperate man.",
    "People are waiting for the first of January.",
    "But Antonius is not waiting for that day, who is now attempting with an army to invade the province of Decimus Brutus, a most illustrious and excellent man.",
    "And when he has procured reinforcements and equipments there, he threatens that he will come to this city.",
    "What is the use then of waiting, or of even a delay for the very shortest time?",
    "For although the first of January is at hand, still a short time is a long one for people who are not prepared.",
    "For a day, or I should rather say an hour, often brings great disasters, if no precautions are taken.",
    "And it is not usual to wait for a fixed day for holding a council, as it is for celebrating a festival.",
    "But if the first of January had fallen on the day when Antonius first fled from the city, or if people had not waited for it, we should by this time have no war at all.",
    "For we should easily have crushed the audacity of that frantic man by the authority of the senate and the unanimity of the Roman people.",
    "And now, indeed, I feel confident that the consuls elect will do so, as soon as they enter on their magistracy.",
    "For they are men of the highest courage, of the most consummate wisdom, and they will act in perfect harmony with each other.",
    "But my exhortations to rapid and instant action are prompted by a desire not merely for victory, but for speedy victory.",
    "For how long are we to trust to the prudence of an individual to repel so important, so cruel, and so nefarious a war?",
    "Why is not the public authority thrown into the scale as quickly as possible?",
    "II.",
    "Caius Caesar, a young man, or, I should rather say, almost a boy, endued with an incredible and godlike degree of wisdom and valour, at the time when the frenzy of Antonius was at its height, and when his cruel and mischievous return from Brundusium was an object of apprehension to all, while we neither desired him to do so, nor thought of such a measure, nor ventured even to wish it, (because it did not seem practicable,) collected a most trustworthy army from the invincible body of veteran soldiers, and has spent his own patrimony in doing so.",
    "Although I have not used the expression which I ought,--for he has not spent it,--he has invested it in the safety of the republic.",
    "And although it is not possible to requite him with all the thanks to which he is entitled, still we ought to feel all the gratitude towards him which our minds are capable of conceiving.",
    "For who is so ignorant of public affairs, so entirely indifferent to all thoughts of the republic, as not to see that, if Marcus Antonius could have come with those forces which he made sure that he should have, from Brundusium to Rome, as he threatened, there would have been no description of cruelty which he would not have practised?",
    "A man who in the house of his entertainer at Brundusium ordered so many most gallant men and virtuous citizens to be murdered, and whose wife's face was notoriously besprinkled with the blood of men dying at his and her feet.",
    "Who is there of us, or what good man is there at all, whom a man stained with this barbarity would ever have spared; especially as he was coming hither much more angry with all virtuous men than he had been with those whom he had massacred there?",
    "And from this calamity Caesar has delivered the republic by his own individual prudence, (and, indeed, there were no other means by which it could have been done.)",
    "And if he had not been born in this republic we should, owing to the wickedness of Antonius, now have no republic at all.",
    "For this is what I believe, this is my deliberate opinion, that if that one young man had not checked the violence and inhuman projects of that frantic man, the republic would have been utterly destroyed.",
    "And to him we must, O conscript fathers, (for this is the first time, met in such a condition, that, owing to his good service, we are at liberty to say freely what we think and feel,) we must, I say, this day give authority, so that he may be able to defend the republic, not because that defence has been voluntarily undertaken by him but also because it has been entrusted to him by us.",
    "III.",
    "Nor (since now after a long interval we are allowed to speak concerning the republic) is it possible for us to be silent about the Martial legion.",
    "For what single man has ever been braver, what single man has ever been more devoted to the republic than the whole of the Martial legion?",
    "which, as soon as it had decided that Marcus Antonius was an enemy of the Roman people, refused to be a companion of his insanity; deserted him though consul; which, in truth, it would not have done if it had considered him as consul, who, as it saw, was aiming at nothing and preparing nothing but the slaughter of the citizens, and the destruction of the state.",
    "And that legion has encamped at Alba.",
    "What city could it have selected either more suitable for enabling it to act, or more faithful, or full of more gallant men, or of citizens more devoted to the republic?",
    "The fourth legion, imitating the virtue of this legion, under the leadership of Lucius Egnatuleius, the quaestor, a most virtuous and intrepid citizen, has also acknowledged the authority and joined the army of Caius Caesar.",
    "We, therefore, O conscript fathers, must take care that those things which this most illustrious young man, this most excellent of all men has of his own accord done, and still is doing, be sanctioned by our authority; and the admirable unanimity of the veterans, those most brave men, and of the Martial and of the fourth legion, in their zeal for the reestablishment of the republic, be encouraged by our praise and commendation.",
    "And let us pledge ourselves this day that their advantage, and honours, and rewards shall be cared for by us as soon as the consuls elect have entered on their magistracy.",
    "IV.",
    "And the things which I have said about Caesar and about his army, are, indeed, already well known to you.",
    "For by the admirable valour of Caesar, and by the firmness of the veteran soldiers, and by the admirable discernment of those legions which have followed our authority, and the liberty of the Roman people, and the valour of Caesar, Antonius has been repelled from his attempts upon our lives.",
    "But these things, as I have said, happened before; but this recent edict of Decimus Brutus, which has just been issued, can certainly not be passed over in silence.",
    "For he promises to preserve the province of Gaul in obedience to the senate and people of Rome.",
    "O citizen, born for the republic; mindful of the name he bears; imitator of his ancestors!",
    "Nor, indeed, was the acquisition of liberty so much an object of desire to our ancestors when Tarquinius was expelled, as, now that Antonius is driven away, the preservation of it is to us.",
    "Those men had learnt to obey kings ever since the foundation of the city, but we from the time when the kings were driven out have forgotten how to be slaves.",
    "And that Tarquinius, whom our ancestors expelled, was not either considered or called cruel or impious, but only The Proud.",
    "That vice which we have often borne in private individuals, our ancestors could not endure even in a king.",
    "Lucius Brutus could not endure a proud king.",
    "Shall Decimus Brutus submit to the kingly power of a man who is wicked and impious?",
    "What atrocity did Tarquinius ever commit equal to the innumerable acts of the sort which Antonius has done and is still doing?",
    "Again, the kings were used to consult the senate; nor, as is the case when Antonius holds a senate, were armed barbarians ever introduced into the council of the king.",
    "The kings paid due regard to the auspices, which this man, though consul and augur, has neglected, not only by passing laws in opposition to the auspices, but also by making his colleague (whom he himself had appointed irregularly, and had falsified the auspices in order to do so) join in passing them.",
    "Again, what king was ever so preposterously impudent as to have all the profits, and kindnesses, and privileges of his kingdom on sale?",
    "But what immunity is there, what rights of citizenship, what rewards that this man has not sold to individuals, and to cities, and to entire provinces?",
    "We have never heard of anything base or sordid being imputed to Tarquinius.",
    "But at the house of this man gold was constantly being weighed out in the spinning room, and money was being paid, and in one single house every soul who had any interest in the business was selling the whole empire of the Roman people.",
    "We have never heard of any executions of Roman citizens by the orders of Tarquinius, but this man both at Suessa murdered the man whom he had thrown into prison, and at Brundusium massacred about three hundred most gallant men and most virtuous citizens.",
    "Lastly, Tarquinius was conducting a war in defence of the Roman people at the very time when he was expelled.",
    "Antonius was leading an army against the Roman people at the time when, being abandoned by the legions, he cowered at the name of Caesar and at his army, and neglecting the regular sacrifices, he offered up before daylight vows which he could never mean to perform, and at this very moment he is endeavouring to invade a province of the Roman people.",
    "The Roman people, therefore, has already received and is still looking for greater services at the hand of Decimus Brutus than our ancestors received from Lucius Brutus, the founder of this race and name which we ought to be so anxious to preserve.",
    "V. But, while all slavery is miserable, to be slave to a man who is profligate, unchaste, effeminate, never, not even while in fear, sober, is surely intolerable.",
    "He, then, who keeps this man out of Gaul, especially by his own private authority, judges, and judges most truly, that he is not consul at all.",
    "We must take care, therefore, O conscript fathers, to sanction the private decision of Decimus Brutus by public authority.",
    "Nor, indeed, ought you to have thought Marcus Antonius consul at any time since the Lupercalia.",
    "For on the day when he, in the sight of the Roman people, harangued the mob, naked, perfumed, and drunk, and laboured moreover to put a crown on the head of his colleague, on that day he abdicated not only the consulship, but also his own freedom.",
    "At all events he himself must at once have become a slave, if Caesar had been willing to accept from him that ensign of royalty.",
    "Can I then think him a consul, can I think him a Roman citizen, can I think him a freeman, can I even think him a man, who on that shameful and wicked day showed what he was willing to endure while Caesar lived, and what he was anxious to obtain himself after he was dead?",
    "Nor is it possible to pass over in silence the virtue and the firmness and the dignity of the province of Gaul.",
    "For that is the flower of Italy, that is the bulwark of the empire of the Roman people, that is the chief ornament of our dignity.",
    "But so perfect is the unanimity of the municipal towns and colonies of the province of Gaul, that all men in that district appear to have united together to defend the authority of this order, and the majesty of the Roman people.",
    "Wherefore, O tribunes of the people, although you have not actually brought any other business before us beyond the question of protection, in order that the consuls may be able to hold the senate with safety on the first of January, still you appear to me to have acted with great wisdom and great prudence in giving an opportunity of debating the general circumstances of the republic.",
    "For when you decided that the senate could not be held with safety without some protection or other, you at the same time asserted by that decision that the wickedness and audacity of Antonius was still continuing its practices within our walls.",
    "VI.",
    "Wherefore, I will embrace every consideration in my opinion which I am now going to deliver, a course to which you, I feel sure, have no objection, in order that authority may be conferred by us on admirable generals, and that hope of reward may be held out by us to gallant soldiers, and that a formal decision may be come to, not by words only, but also by actions, that Antonius is not only not a consul, but is even an enemy.",
    "For if he be consul, then the legions which have deserted the consul deserve beating[24] to death.",
    "Caesar is wicked, Brutus is impious, since they of their own heads have levied an army against the consul.",
    "But if new honours are to be sought out for the soldiers on account of their divine and immortal merits, and if it is quite impossible to show gratitude enough to the generals, who is there who must not think that man a public enemy, whose conduct is such that those who are in arms against him are considered the saviours of the republic?",
    "Again, how insulting is he in his edicts!",
    "how ignorant!",
    "How like a barbarian!",
    "In the first place, how has he heaped abuse on Caesar, in terms drawn from his recollection of his own debauchery and profligacy.",
    "For where can we find any one who is chaster than this young man?",
    "who is more modest?",
    "where have we among our youth a more illustrious example of the old-fashioned strictness?",
    "Who, on the other hand, is more profligate than the man who abuses him?",
    "He reproaches the son of Caius Caesar with his want of noble blood, when even his natural[25] father, if he had been alive, would have been made consul.",
    "His mother is a woman of Aricia.",
    "You might suppose he was saying a woman of Tralles, or of Ephesus.",
    "Just see how we all who come from the municipal towns--that is to say, absolutely all of us--are looked down upon; for how few of us are there who do not come from those towns?",
    "and what municipal town is there which he does not despise who looks with such contempt on Aricia; a town most ancient as to its antiquity; if we regard its rights, united with us by treaty; if we regard its vicinity, almost close to us; if we regard the high character of its inhabitants, most honourable?",
    "It is from Aricia that we have received the Voconian and Atinian laws; from Aricia have come many of those magistrates who have filled our curule chairs, both in our fathers' recollection and in our own; from Aricia have sprung many of the best and bravest of the Roman knights.",
    "But if you disapprove of a wife from Aricia, why do you approve of one from Tusculum?",
    "Although the father of this most virtuous and excellent woman, Marcus Atius Balbus, a man of the highest character, was a man of praetorian rank; but the father of your wife,--a good woman, at all events a rich one,--a fellow of the name of Bambalio, was a man of no account at all.",
    "Nothing could be lower than he was, a fellow who got his surname as a sort of insult, derived[26] from the hesitation of his speech and the stolidity of his understanding.",
    "Oh, but your grandfather was nobly born.",
    "Yes, he was that Tuditanus who used to put on a cloak and buskins, and then go and scatter money from the rostra among the people.",
    "I wish he had bequeathed his contempt of money to his descendants!",
    "You have, indeed, a most glorious nobility of family!",
    "But how does it happen that the son of a woman of Aricia appears to you to be ignoble, when you are accustomed to boast of a descent on the mother's side which is precisely the same?[27] Besides, what insanity is it for that man to say anything about the want of noble birth in men's wives, when his father married Numitoria of Fregellae, the daughter of a traitor, and when he himself has begotten children of the daughter of a freedman.",
    "However, those illustrious men Lucius Philippus, who has a wife who came from Aricia, and Caius Marcellus, whose wife is the daughter of an Arician, may look to this; and I am quite sure that they have no regrets on the score of the dignity of those admirable women.",
    "VII.",
    "Moreover, Antonius proceeds to name Quintus Cicero, my brother's son, in his edict; and is so mad as not to perceive that the way in which he names him is a panegyric on him.",
    "For what could happen more desirable for this young man, than to be known by every one to be the partner of Caesar's counsels, and the enemy of the frenzy of Antonius?",
    "But this gladiator has dared to put in writing that he had designed the murder of his father and of his uncle.",
    "Oh the marvellous impudence, and audacity, and temerity of such an assertion!",
    "to dare to put this in writing against that young man, whom I and my brother, on account of his amiable manners, and pure character, and splendid abilities, vie with one another in loving, and to whom we incessantly devote our eyes, and ears, and affections!",
    "And as to me, he does not know whether he is injuring or praising me in those same edicts.",
    "When he threatens the most virtuous citizens with the same punishment which I inflicted on the most wicked and infamous of men, he seems to praise me as if he were desirous of copying me; but when he brings up again the memory of that most illustrious exploit, then he thinks that he is exciting some odium against me in the breasts of men like himself.",
    "VIII.",
    "But what is it that he has done himself?",
    "When he had published all these edicts, he issued another, that the senate was to meet in a full house on the twenty-fourth of November.",
    "On that day he himself was not present.",
    "But what were the terms of his edict?",
    "These, I believe, are the exact words of the end of it: \"If any one fails to attend, all men will be at liberty to think him the adviser of my destruction and of most ruinous counsels\".",
    "What are ruinous counsels?",
    "those which relate to the recovery of the liberty of the Roman people?",
    "Of those counsels I confess that I have been and still am an adviser and prompter to Caesar.",
    "Although he did not stand in need of any one's advice, but still I spurned on the willing horse, as it is said.",
    "For what good man would not have advised putting you to death, when on your death depended the safety and life of every good man, and the liberty and dignity of the Roman people?",
    "But when he had summoned us all by so severe an edict, why did he not attend himself?",
    "Do you suppose that he was detained by any melancholy or important occasion?",
    "He was detained drinking and feasting.",
    "If, indeed, it deserves to be called a feast, and not rather gluttony.",
    "He neglected to attend on the day mentioned in his edict, and he adjourned the meeting to the twenty-eighth.",
    "He then summoned us to attend in the Capitol, and at that temple he did arrive himself, coming up through some mine left by the Gauls.",
    "Men came, having been summoned, some of them indeed men of high distinction, but forgetful of what was due to their dignity.",
    "For the day was such, the report of the object of the meeting such, such too the man who had convened the senate, that it was discreditable for a senate to feel no fear for the result.",
    "And yet to those men who had assembled he did not dare to say a single word about Caesar, though he had made up his mind[28] to submit a motion respecting him to the senate.",
    "There was a man of consular rank who had brought a resolution ready drawn up.",
    "Is it not now admitting that he is himself an enemy, when he does not dare to make a motion respecting a man who is leading an army against him while he is consul?",
    "For it is perfectly plain that one of the two must be an enemy, nor is it possible to come to a different decision respecting adverse generals.",
    "If then Caius Caesar be an enemy, why does the consul submit no motion to the senate?",
    "If he does not deserve to be branded by the senate, then what can the consul say, who, by his silence respecting him, has confessed that he himself is an enemy?",
    "In his edicts he styles him Spartacus, while in the senate he does not venture to call him even a bad citizen.",
    "IX.",
    "But in the most melancholy circumstances what mirth does he not provoke?",
    "I have committed to memory some short phrases of one edict, which he appears to think particularly clever, but I have not as yet found any one who has understood what he intended by them.",
    "\"That is no insult which a worthy man does.\"",
    "Now, in the first place, what is the meaning of \"worthy?\"",
    "For there are many men worthy of punishment, as he himself is.",
    "Does he mean what a man does who is invested with any dignity?[29] if so, what insult can be greater?",
    "Moreover, what is the meaning of \"doing an insult?\"",
    "Who ever uses such an expression?",
    "Then comes, \"Nor any fear which an enemy threatens\" What then?",
    "is fear usually threatened by a friend?",
    "Then came many similar sentences.",
    "Is it not better to be dumb, than to say what no one can understand?",
    "Now see why his tutor, exchanging pleas for ploughs, has had given to him in the public domain of the Roman people two thousand acres of land in the Leontine district, exempt from all taxes, for making a stupid man still stupider at the public expense.",
    "However, these perhaps are trifling matters.",
    "I ask now, why all on a sudden he became so gentle in the senate, after having been so fierce in his edicts?",
    "For what was the object of threatening Lucius Cassius, a most fearless tribune of the people, and a most virtuous and loyal citizen, with death if he came to the Senate?",
    "of expelling Decimus Caifulenus, a man thoroughly attached to the republic, from the senate by violence and threats of death?",
    "of interdicting Titus Canutius, by whom he had been repeatedly and deservedly harassed by most legitimate attacks, not only from the temple itself but from all approach to it?",
    "What was the resolution of the senate which he was afraid that they would stop by the interposition of their veto?",
    "That, I suppose, respecting the supplication in honour of Marcus Lepidus, a most illustrious man!",
    "Certainly there was a great danger of our hindering an ordinary compliment to a man on whom we were every day thinking of conferring some extraordinary honour.",
    "However, that he might not appear to have had no reason at all for ordering the senate to meet, he was on the point of bringing forward some motion about the republic, when the news about the fourth legion came; which entirely bewildered him, and hastening to flee away, he took a division on the resolution for decreeing this supplication, though such a proceeding had never been heard of before.[30] X. But what a setting out was his after this!",
    "what a journey when he was in his robe as a general!",
    "How did he shun all eyes, and the light of day, and the city, and the forum!",
    "How miserable was his flight!",
    "how shameful!",
    "how infamous!",
    "Splendid, too, were the decrees of the senate passed on the evening of that very day; very religiously solemn was the allotment of the provinces; and heavenly indeed was the opportunity, when everyone got exactly what he thought most desirable.",
    "You are acting admirably, therefore, O tribunes of the people, in bringing forward a motion about the protection of the senate and consuls, and most deservedly are we all bound to feel and to prove to you the greatest gratitude for your conduct.",
    "For how can we be free from fear and danger while menaced by such covetousness and audacity?",
    "And as for that ruined and desperate man, what more hostile decision can be passed upon him than has already been passed by his own friends?",
    "His most intimate friend, a man connected with me too, Lucius Lentulus, and also Publius Naso, a man destitute of covetousness, have shown that they think that they have no provinces assigned them, and that the allotments of Antonius are invalid.",
    "Lucius Philippus, a man thoroughly worthy of his father and grandfather and ancestors, has done the same.",
    "The same is the opinion of Marcus Turanius, a man of the greatest integrity and purity of life.",
    "The same is the conduct of Publius Oppius; and those very men,--who, influenced by their friendship for Marcus Antonius, have attributed to him more power than they would perhaps really approve of,--Marcus Piso, my own connexion, a most admirable man and virtuous citizen, and Marcus Vehilius, a man of equal respectability, have both declared that they would obey the authority of the senate.",
    "Why should I speak of Lucius Cinna?",
    "whose extraordinary integrity, proved under many trying circumstances, makes the glory of his present admirable conduct less remarkable; he has altogether disregarded the province assigned to him; and so has Caius Cestius, a man of great and firm mind.",
    "Who are there left then to be delighted with this heavensent allotment?",
    "Lucius Antonius and Marcus Antonius!",
    "O happy pair!",
    "for there is nothing that they wished for more.",
    "Caius Antonius has Macedonia.",
    "Happy, too, is he!",
    "For he was constantly talking about this province.",
    "Caius Calvisius has Africa.",
    "Nothing could be more fortunate, for he had only just departed from Africa, and, as if he had divined that he should return, he left two lieutenants at Utica.",
    "Then Marcus Iccius has Sicily, and Quintus Cassius Spain.",
    "I do not know what to suspect.",
    "I fancy the lots which assigned these two provinces, were not quite so carefully attended to by the gods.",
    "XI.",
    "O Caius Caesar, (I am speaking of the young man,) what safety have you brought to the republic!",
    "How unforeseen has it been!",
    "how sudden!",
    "for if he did these things when flying, what would he have done when he was pursuing?",
    "In truth, he had said in a harangue that he would be the guardian of the city; and that he would keep his army at the gates of the city till the first of May.",
    "What a fine guardian (as the proverb goes) is the wolf of the sheep!",
    "Would Antonius have been a guardian of the city, or its plunderer and destroyer?",
    "And he said too that he would come into the city and go out as he pleased.",
    "What more need I say?",
    "Did he not say, in the hearing of all the people, while sitting in front of the temple of Castor, that no one should remain alive but the conqueror?",
    "On this day, O conscript fathers, for the first time after a long interval do we plant our foot and take possession of liberty.",
    "Liberty, of which, as long as I could be, I was not only the defender, but even the saviour.",
    "But when I could not be so, I rested; and I bore the misfortunes and misery of that period without abjectness, and not without some dignity.",
    "But as for this most foul monster, who could endure him, or how could any one endure him?",
    "What is there in Antonius except lust, and cruelty, and wantonness, and audacity?",
    "Of these materials he is wholly made up.",
    "There is in him nothing ingenuous, nothing moderate, nothing modest, nothing virtuous.",
    "Wherefore, since the matter has come to such a crisis that the question is whether he is to make atonement to the republic for his crimes, or we are to become slaves, let us at last, I beseech you, by the immortal gods, O conscript fathers, adopt our fathers' courage, and our fathers' virtue, so as either to recover the liberty belonging to the Roman name and race, or else to prefer death to slavery.",
    "We have borne and endured many things which ought not to be endured in a free city, some of us out of a hope of recovering our freedom, some from too great a fondness for life.",
    "But if we have submitted to these things, which necessity and a sort of force which may seem almost to have been put on us by destiny have compelled us to endure, though, in point of fact, we have not endured them, are we also to bear with the most shameful and inhuman tyranny of this profligate robber?",
    "XII.",
    "What will he do in his passion, if ever he has the power, who, when he is not able to show his anger against any one, has been the enemy of all good men?",
    "What will he not dare to do when victorious, who, without having gained any victory, has committed such crimes as these since the death of Caesar? has emptied his well filled house?",
    "has pillaged his gardens?",
    "has transferred to his own mansion all their ornaments?",
    "has sought to make his death a pretext for slaughter and conflagration?",
    "who, while he has carried two or three resolutions of the senate which have been advantageous to the republic, has made everything else subservient to his own acquisition of gain and plunder?",
    "who has put up exemptions and annuities to sale?",
    "who has released cities from obligations?",
    "who has removed whole provinces from subjection to the Roman empire?",
    "who has restored exiles?",
    "who has passed forged laws in the name of Caesar, and has continued to have forged decrees engraved on brass and fixed up in the Capitol, and has set up in his own house a domestic market for all things of that sort?",
    "who has imposed laws on the Roman people?",
    "and who, with armed troops and guards, has excluded both the people and the magistrates from the forum?",
    "who has filled the senate with armed men?",
    "and has introduced armed men into the temple of Concord when he was holding a senate there?",
    "who ran down to Brundusium to meet the legions, and then murdered all the centurions in them who were well affected to the republic?",
    "who endeavoured to come to Rome with his army to accomplish our massacre and the utter destruction of the city?",
    "And he, now that he has been prevented from succeeding in this attempt by the wisdom and forces of Caesar, and the unanimity of the veterans, and the valour of the legions, even now that his fortunes are desperate, does not diminish his audacity, nor, mad that he is, does he cease proceeding in his headlong career of fury.",
    "He is leading his mutilated army into Gaul, with one legion, and that too wavering in its fidelity to him, he is waiting for his brother Lucius, as he cannot find any one more nearly like himself than him.",
    "But now what slaughter is this man, who has thus become a captain instead of a matador, a general instead of a gladiator, making, wherever he sets his foot!",
    "He destroys stores, he slays the flocks and herds, and all the cattle, wherever he finds them, his soldiers revel in their spoil, and he himself, in order to imitate his brother, drowns himself in wine.",
    "Fields are laid waste, villas are plundered, matrons, virgins, well born boys are carried off and given up to the soldiery, and Marcus Antonius has done exactly the same wherever he has led his army.",
    "XIII.",
    "Will you open your gates to these most infamous brothers?",
    "will you ever admit them into the city?",
    "will you not rather, now that the opportunity is offered to you, now that you have generals ready, and the minds of the soldiers eager for the service, and all the Roman people unanimous, and all Italy excited with the desire to recover its liberty,--will you not, I say, avail yourself of the kindness of the immortal gods?",
    "You will never have an opportunity if you neglect this one.",
    "He will be hemmed in in the rear, in the front, and in flank, if he once enters Gaul.",
    "Nor must he be attacked by arms alone, but by our decrees also.",
    "Mighty is the authority, mighty is the name of the senate when all its members are inspired by one and the same resolution.",
    "Do you not see how the forum is crowded?",
    "how the Roman people is on tiptoe with the hope of recovering its liberty?",
    "which now, beholding us, after a long interval, meeting here in numbers, hopes too that we are also met in freedom.",
    "It was in expectation of this day that I avoided the wicked army of Marcus Antonius, at a time when he, while inveighing against me, was not aware for what an occasion I was reserving myself and my strength.",
    "If at that time I had chosen to reply to him, while he was seeking to begin the massacre with me, I should not now be able to consult the welfare of the republic.",
    "But now that I have this opportunity, I will never, O conscript fathers, neither by day nor by night, cease considering what ought to be thought concerning the liberty of the Roman people, and concerning your dignity.",
    "And whatever ought to be planned or done, I not only will never shrink from, but I will offer myself for, and beg to have entrusted to me.",
    "This is what I did before while it was in my power; when it was no longer in my power to do so, I did nothing.",
    "But now it is not only in my power, but it is absolutely necessary for me, unless we prefer being slaves to fighting with all our strength and courage to avoid being slaves.",
    "The immortal gods have given us these protectors, Caesar for the city, Brutus for Gaul.",
    "For if he had been able to oppress the city we must have become slaves at once; if he had been able to get possession of Gaul, then it would not have been long before every good man must have perished and all the rest have been enslaved.",
    "XIV.",
    "Now then that this opportunity is afforded to you, O conscript fathers, I entreat you in the name of the immortal gods, seize upon it; and recollect at last that you are the chief men of the most honourable council on the whole face of the earth.",
    "Give a token to the Roman people that your wisdom shall not fail the republic, since that too professes that its valour shall never desert it either.",
    "There is no need for my warning you: there is no one so foolish as not to perceive that if we go to sleep over this opportunity we shall have to endure a tyranny which will be not only cruel and haughty, but also ignominious and flagitious.",
    "You know the insolence of Antonius; you know his friends; you know his whole household.",
    "To be slaves to lustful, wanton, debauched, profligate, drunken gamblers, is the extremity of misery combined with the extremity of infamy.",
    "And if now (but may the immortal gods avert the omen!)",
    "that worst of fates shall befall the republic, then, as brave gladiators take care to perish with honour, let us too, who are the chief men of all countries and nations, take care to fall with dignity rather than to live as slaves with ignominy.",
    "There is nothing more detestable than disgrace; nothing more shameful than slavery.",
    "We have been born to glory and to liberty; let us either preserve them or die with dignity.",
    "Too long have we concealed what we have felt: now at length it is revealed: every one has plainly shown what are his feelings to both sides, and what are his inclinations.",
    "There are impious citizens, measured by the love I bear my country, too many; but in proportion to the multitude of well-affected ones, very few; and the immortal gods have given the republic an incredible opportunity and chance for destroying them.",
    "For, in addition to the defences which we already have, there will soon be added consuls of consummate prudence, and virtue, and concord, who have already deliberated and pondered for many months on the freedom of the Roman people.",
    "With these men for our advisers and leaders, with the gods assisting us, with ourselves using all vigilance and taking great precautions for the future, and with the Roman people acting with unanimity, we shall indeed be free in a short time, and the recollection of our present slavery will make liberty sweeter.",
    "XV.",
    "Moved by these considerations, since the tribunes of the people have brought forward a motion to ensure that the senate shall be able to meet in safety on the first of January, and that we may be able to deliver our sentiments on the general welfare of the state with freedom, I give my vote that Caius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius, the consuls elect, do take care that the senate be enabled to meet in safety on the first of January; and, as an edict has been published by Decimus Brutus, imperator and consul elect, I vote that the senate thinks that Decimus Brutus, imperator and consul, deserves excellently well of the republic, inasmuch as he is upholding the authority of the senate, and the freedom and empire of the Roman people; and as he is also retaining the province of Gallia Citerior, a province full of most virtuous and brave men, and of citizens most devoted to the republic, and his army, in obedience to the senate, I vote that the senate judges that he, and his army, and the municipalities and colonies of the province of Gaul, have acted and are acting properly, and regularly, and in a manner advantageous to the republic.",
    "And the senate thinks that it will be for the general interests of the republic that the provinces which are at present occupied by Decimus Brutus and by Lucius Plancus, both imperators, and consuls elect, and also by the officers who are in command of provinces, shall continue to be held by them in accordance with the provisions of the Julian law, until each of these officers has a successor appointed by a resolution of the senate; and that they shall take care to maintain those provinces and armies in obedience to the senate and people of Rome, and as a defence to the republic.",
    "And since, by the exertions and valour and wisdom of Caius Caesar, and by the admirable unanimity of the veteran soldiers, who, obeying his authority, have been and are a protection to the republic, the Roman people has been defended, and is at this present time being defended, from the most serious dangers.",
    "And as the Martial legion has encamped at Alba, in a municipal town of the greatest loyalty and courage, and has devoted itself to the support of the authority of the senate, and of the freedom of the Roman people; and as the fourth legion, behaving with equal wisdom and with the same virtue, under the command of Lucius Egnatuleius the quaestor, an illustrious citizen, has defended and is still defending the authority of the senate and the freedom of the Roman people; I give my vote, That it is and shall be an object of anxious care to the senate to pay due honour and to show due gratitude to them for their exceeding services to the republic: and that the senate hereby orders that when Caius Pausa and Aulus Hirtius, the consuls elect, have entered on their office, they take the earliest opportunity of consulting this body on these matters, as shall seem to them expedient for the republic, and worthy of their own integrity and loyalty.",

    "CALLED ALSO THE FOURTH PHILIPPIC.",
    "*",
    "* *",
    "* *",
    "THE ARGUMENT.",
    "After delivering the preceding speech in the senate, Cicero proceeded to the forum, where he delivered the following speech to the people, to give them information of what had been done.",
    "I.",
    "The great numbers in which you are here met this day, O Romans, and this assembly, greater than, it seems to me, I ever remember, inspires me with both an exceeding eagerness to defend the republic, and with a great hope of reestablishing it.",
    "Although my courage indeed has never failed; what has been unfavourable is the time; and the moment that that has appeared to show any dawn of light, I at once have been the leader in the defence of your liberty.",
    "And if I had attempted to have done so before, I should not be able to do so now.",
    "For this day, O Romans, (that you may not think it is but a trifling business in which we have been engaged,) the foundations have been laid for future actions.",
    "For the senate has no longer been content with styling Antonius an enemy in words, but it has shown by actions that it thinks him one.",
    "And now I am much more elated still, because you too with such great unanimity and with such a clamour have sanctioned our declaration that he is an enemy.",
    "And indeed, O Romans, it is impossible but that either the men must be impious who have levied armies against the consul, or else that he must be an enemy against whom they have rightly taken arms.",
    "And this doubt the senate has this day removed--not indeed that there really was any; but it has prevented the possibility of there being any.",
    "Caius Caesar, who has upheld and who is still upholding the republic and your freedom by his seal and wisdom, and at the expense of his patrimonial estate, has been complimented with the highest praises of the senate.",
    "I praise you,--yes, I praise you greatly, O Romans, when you follow with the most grateful minds the name of that most illustrious youth, or rather boy; for his actions belong to immortality, the name of youth only to his age.",
    "I can recollect many things; I have heard of many things; I have read of many things; but in the whole history of the whole world I have never known anything like this.",
    "For, when we were weighed down with slavery, when the evil was daily increasing, when we had no defence, while we were in dread of the pernicious and fatal return of Marcus Antonius from Brundusium, this young man adopted the design which none of us had ventured to hope for, which beyond all question none of us were acquainted with, of raising an invincible army of his father's soldiers, and so hindering the frenzy of Antonius, spurred on as it was by the most inhuman counsels, from the power of doing mischief to the republic.",
    "II.",
    "For who is there who does not see clearly that, if Caesar had not prepared an army, the return of Antonius must have been accompanied by our destruction?",
    "For, in truth, he returned in such a state of mind, burning with hatred of you all, stained with the blood of the Roman citizens, whom he had murdered at Suessa and at Brundusium, that he thought of nothing but the utter destruction of the republic.",
    "And what protection could have been found for your safety and for your liberty if the army of Caius Caesar had not been composed of the bravest of his father's soldiers?",
    "And with respect to his praises and honours,--and he is entitled to divine and everlasting honours for his godlike and undying services,--the senate has just consented to my proposals, and has decreed that a motion be submitted to it at the very earliest opportunity.",
    "Now who is there who does not see that by this decree Antonius has been adjudged to be an enemy?",
    "For what else can we call him, when the senate decides that extraordinary honours are to be devised for those men who are leading armies against him?",
    "What?",
    "did not the Martial legion (which appears to me by some divine permission to have derived its name from that god from whom we have heard that the Roman people descended) decide by its resolutions that Antonius was an enemy before the senate had come to any resolution?",
    "For if he be not an enemy, we must inevitably decide that those men who have deserted the consul are enemies.",
    "Admirably and seasonably, O Romans, have you by your cries sanctioned the noble conduct of the men of the Martial legion, who have come over to the authority of the senate, to your liberty, and to the whole republic; and have abandoned that enemy and robber and parricide of his country.",
    "Nor did they display only their spirit and courage in doing this, but their caution and wisdom also.",
    "They encamped at Alba, in a city convenient, fortified, near, full of brave men and loyal and virtuous citizens.",
    "The fourth legion imitating the virtue of this Martial legion, under the leadership of Lucius Egnatuleius, whom the senate deservedly praised a little while ago, has also joined the army of Caius Caesar.",
    "III.",
    "What more adverse decisions, O Marcus Antonius, can you want?",
    "Caesar, who has levied an army against you, is extolled to the skies.",
    "The legions are praised in the most complimentary language, which have abandoned you, which were sent for into Italy by you; and which, if you had chosen to be a consul rather than an enemy, were wholly devoted to you.",
    "And the fearless and honest decision of those legions is confirmed by the senate, is approved of by the whole Roman people,--unless, indeed, you to-day, O Romans, decide that Antonius is a consul and not an enemy.",
    "I thought, O Romans, that you did think as you show you do.",
    "What?",
    "do you suppose that the municipal towns, and the colonies, and the prefectures have any other opinion?",
    "All men are agreed with one mind; so that every one who wishes the state to be saved must take up every sort of arms against that pestilence.",
    "What?",
    "does, I should like to know, does the opinion of Decimus Brutus, O Romans, which you can gather from his edict, which has this day reached us, appear to any one deserving of being lightly esteemed?",
    "Rightly and truly do you say No, O Romans.",
    "For the family and name of Brutus has been by some especial kindness and liberality of the immortal gods given to the republic, for the purpose of at one time establishing, and at another of recovering, the liberty of the Roman people.",
    "What then has been the opinion which Decimus Brutus has formed of Marcus Antonius?",
    "He excludes him from his province.",
    "He opposes him with his army.",
    "He rouses all Gaul to war, which is already used of its own accord, and in consequence of the judgment which it has itself formed.",
    "If Antonius be consul, Brutus is an enemy.",
    "Can we then doubt which of these alternatives is the fact?",
    "IV.",
    "And just as you now with one mind and one voice affirm that you entertain no doubt, so did the senate just now decree that Decimus Brutus deserved excellently well of the republic, inasmuch as he was defending the authority of the senate and the liberty and empire of the Roman people.",
    "Defending it against whom?",
    "Why, against an enemy.",
    "For what other sort of defence deserves praise?",
    "In the next place the province of Gaul is praised, and is deservedly complimented in most honourable language by the senate for resisting Antonius.",
    "But if that province considered him the consul, and still refused to receive him, it would be guilty of great wickedness.",
    "For all the provinces belong to the consul of right, and are bound to obey him.",
    "Decimus Brutus, imperator and consul elect, a citizen born for the republic, denies that he is consul; Gaul denies it; all Italy denies it; the senate denies it; you deny it.",
    "Who then think that he is consul except a few robbers?",
    "Although even they themselves do not believe what they say; nor is it possible that they should differ from the judgment of all men, impious and desperate men though they be.",
    "But the hope of plunder and booty blinds their minds; men whom no gifts of money, no allotment of land, nor even that interminable auction has satisfied; who have proposed to themselves the city, the properties and fortunes of all the citizens as their booty; and who, as long as there is something for them to seize and carry off, think that nothing will be wanting to them; among whom Marcus Antonius (O ye immortal gods, avert, I pray you, and efface this omen,) has promised to divide this city.",
    "May things rather happen, O Romans, as you pray that they should, and may the chastisement of this frenzy fall on him and on his friend.",
    "And, indeed, I feel sure that it will be so.",
    "For I think that at present not only men but the immortal gods have all united together to preserve this republic.",
    "For if the immortal gods foreshow us the future, by means of portents and prodigies, then it has been openly revealed to us that punishment is near at hand to him, and liberty to us.",
    "Or if it was impossible for such unanimity on the part of all men to exist without the inspiration of the gods, in either case how can we doubt as to the inclinations of the heavenly deities?",
    "It only remains, O Romans, for you to persevere in the sentiments which you at present display.",
    "V. I will act, therefore, as commanders are in the habit of doing when their army is ready for battle, who, although they see their soldiers ready to engage, still address an exhortation to them; and in like manner I will exhort you who are already eager and burning to recover your liberty.",
    "You have not--you have not, indeed, O Romans, to war against an enemy with whom it is possible to make peace on any terms whatever.",
    "For he does not now desire your slavery, as he did before, but he is angry now and thirsts for your blood.",
    "No sport appears more delightful to him than bloodshed, and slaughter, and the massacre of citizens before his eyes.",
    "You have not, O Romans, to deal with a wicked and profligate man, but with an unnatural and savage beast.",
    "And, since he has fallen into a well, let him be buried in it.",
    "For if he escapes out of it, there will be no inhumanity of torture which it will be possible to avoid.",
    "But he is at present hemmed in, pressed, and besieged by those troops which we already have, and will soon be still more so by those which in a few days the new consuls will levy.",
    "Apply yourselves then to this business, as you are doing.",
    "Never have you shown greater unanimity in any cause; never have you been so cordially united with the senate.",
    "And no wonder.",
    "For the question now is not in what condition we are to live, but whether we are to live at all, or to perish with torture and ignominy.",
    "Although nature, indeed, has appointed death for all men: but valour is accustomed to ward off any cruelty or disgrace in death.",
    "And that is an inalienable possession of the Roman race and name.",
    "Preserve, I beseech you, O Romans, this attribute which your ancestors have left you as a sort of inheritance.",
    "Although all other things are uncertain, fleeting, transitory; virtue alone is planted firm with very deep roots; it cannot be undermined by any violence; it can never be moved from its position.",
    "By it your ancestors first subdued the whole of Italy; then destroyed Carthage, overthrew Numantia, and reduced the most mighty kings and most warlike nations under the dominion of this empire.",
    "VI.",
    "And your ancestors, O Romans, had to deal with an enemy who had also a republic, a senate-house, a treasury, harmonious and united citizens, and with whom, if fortune had so willed it, there might have been peace and treaties on settled principles.",
    "But this enemy of yours is attacking your republic, but has none himself; is eager to destroy the senate, that is to say, the council of the whole world, but has no public council himself; he has exhausted your treasury, and has none of his own.",
    "For how can a man be supported by the unanimity of his citizens, who has no city at all?",
    "And what principles of peace can there be with that man who is full of incredible cruelty, and destitute of faith?",
    "The whole then of the contest, O Romans, which is now before the Roman people, the conqueror of all nations, is with an assassin, a robber, a Spartacus.[31] For as to his habitual boast of being like Catilina, he is equal to him in wickedness, but inferior in energy.",
    "He, though he had no army, rapidly levied one.",
    "This man has lost that very army which he had.",
    "As, therefore, by my diligence, and the authority of the senate, and your own zeal and valour, you crushed Catilina, so you will very soon hear that this infamous piratical enterprise of Antonius has been put down by your own perfect and unexampled harmony with the senate, and by the good fortune and valour of your armies and generals.",
    "I, for my part, as far as I am able to labour, and to effect anything by my care, and exertions, and vigilance, and authority, and counsel, will omit nothing which I may think serviceable to your liberty.",
    "Nor could I omit it without wickedness after all your most ample and honourable kindness to me.",
    "However, on this day, encouraged by the motion of a most gallant man, and one most firmly attached to you, Marcus Servilius, whom you see before you, and his colleagues also, most distinguished men, and most virtuous citizens; and partly, too, by my advice and my example, we have, for the first time after a long interval, fired up again with a hope of liberty.",

    "OTHERWISE CALLED THE FIFTH PHILIPPIC.",
    "*",
    "* *",
    "* *",
    "THE ARGUMENT.",
    "The new consuls Hirtius and Pansa were much attached to Cicero, had consulted him a great deal, and professed great respect for his opinion; but they were also under great obligations to Julius Caesar and, consequently, connected to some extent with his party and with Antonius, on which account they wished, if possible, to employ moderate measures only against him.",
    "As soon as they had entered on their office, they convoked the senate to meet for the purpose of deliberating on the general welfare of the republic.",
    "They both spoke themselves with great firmness, promising to be the leaders in defending the liberties of Rome, and exhorting the senate to act with courage.",
    "And then they called on Quintus Fufius Calenus, who had been consul A.U.C. 707, and who was Pansa's father-in-law, to deliver his opinion first.",
    "He was known to be a firm friend of Antonius.",
    "Cicero wished to declare Antonius a public enemy at once, but Calenus proposed that before they proceeded to acts of open hostility against him, they should send an embassy to him to admonish him to desist from his attempts upon Gaul, and to submit to the authority of the senate.",
    "Piso and others supported this motion, on the ground that it was cruel and unjust to condemn a man without giving him a fair chance of submitting, and without hearing what he had to say.",
    "It was in opposition to Calenus's motion that Cicero made the following speech, substituting for his proposition one to declare Antonius an enemy, and to offer pardon to those of his army who returned to their duty by the first of February, to thank Decimus Brutus for his conduct in Gaul, to decree a statue to Marcus Lepidus[32] for his services to the republic and his loyalty, to thank Caius Caesar (Octavius) and to grant him a special commission as general, to make him a senator and propraetor and to enable him to stand for any subsequent magistracy as if he had been quaestor, to thank Lucius Egnatuleius, and to vote thanks and promise rewards to the Martial and the fourth legion.",
    "I. Nothing, O conscript fathers, has ever seemed to me longer than these calends of January, and I think that for the last few days you have all been feeling the same thing.",
    "For those who are waging war against the republic have not waited for this day.",
    "But we, while it would have been most especially proper for us to come to the aid of the general safety with our counsel, were not summoned to the senate.",
    "However, the speech just addressed to us by the consuls has removed our complaints as to what is past, for they have spoken in such a manner that the calends of January seem to have been long wished for rather than really to have arrived late.",
    "And while the speeches of the consuls have encouraged my mind, and have given me a hope, not only of preserving our safety, but even of recovering our former dignity, on the other hand, the opinion of the man who has been asked for his opinion first would have disturbed me, if I had not confidence in your virtue and firmness.",
    "For this day, O conscript fathers, has dawned upon you, and this opportunity has been afforded you of proving to the Roman people how much virtue, how much firmness and how much dignity exists in the counsels of this order.",
    "Recollect what a day it was thirteen days ago, how great was then your unanimity, and virtue, and firmness, and what great praise, what great glory, and what great gratitude you gained from the Roman people.",
    "And on that day, O conscript fathers, you resolved that no other alternative was in your power, except either an honourable peace, or a necessary war.",
    "Is Marcus Antonius desirous of peace?",
    "Let him lay down his arms, let him implore our pardon, let him deprecate our vengeance; he will find no one more reasonable than me, though, while seeking to recommend himself to impious citizens, he has chosen to be an enemy instead of a friend to me.",
    "There is, in truth, nothing which can be given to him while waging war, there will perhaps be something which may be granted to him if he comes before us as a suppliant.",
    "II.",
    "But to send ambassadors to a man respecting whom you passed a most dignified and severe decision only thirteen days ago, is not an act of lenity, but, if I am to speak my real opinion, of downright madness.",
    "In the first place, you praised those generals who, of their own head, had undertaken war against him, in the next place, you praised the veterans who, though they had been settled in those colonies by Antonius, preferred the liberty of the Roman people to the obligations which they were under to him.",
    "Is it not so?",
    "Why was the Martial legion?",
    "why was the fourth legion praised?",
    "For if they have deserted the consul, they ought to be blamed; if they have abandoned an enemy to the republic, then they are deservedly praised.",
    "But as at that time you had not yet got any consuls, you passed a decree that a motion concerning the rewards for the soldiers and the honours to be conferred on the generals should be submitted to you at the earliest opportunity.",
    "Are you then going now to arrange rewards for those men who have taken arms against Antonius, and to send ambassadors to Antonius?",
    "so as to deserve to be ashamed that the legions should have come to more honourable resolutions than the senate if, indeed, the legions have resolved to defend the senate against Antonius, but the senate decrees to send ambassadors to Antonius.",
    "Is this encouraging the spirit of the soldiers, or damping their virtue?",
    "This is what we have gained in the last twelve days, that the man whom no single person except Cotyla was then found to defend, has now advocates even of consular rank.",
    "Would that they had all been asked their opinion before me, (although I have my suspicions as to what some of those men who will be asked after me, are intending to say)",
    "I should find it easier to speak against them if any argument appeared to have been advanced.",
    "For there is an opinion in some quarters that some one intends to propose to decree Antonius that further Gaul, which Plancus is at present in possession of.",
    "What else is that but supplying an enemy with all the arms necessary for civil war; first of all with the sinews of war, money in abundance, of which he is at present destitute, and secondly, with as much cavalry as he pleases?",
    "Cavalry do I say?",
    "He is a likely man to hesitate, I suppose, to bring with him the barbarian nations,--a man who does not see this is senseless, he who does see it, and still advocates such a measure, is impious.",
    "Will you furnish a wicked and desperate citizen with an army of Gauls and Germans, with money, and infantry, and cavalry, and all sorts of resources?",
    "All these excuses are no excuse at all.--\"He is a friend of mine.\"",
    "Let him first be a friend of his country.--\"He is a relation of mine.\"",
    "Can any relationship be nearer than that of one's country, in which even one's parents are comprised?",
    "\"He has given me money:\"--I should like to see the man who will dare to say that.",
    "But when I have explained what is the real object aimed at, it will be easy for you to decide which opinion you ought to agree with and adopt.",
    "III.",
    "The matter at issue is, whether power is to be given to Marcus Antonius of oppressing the republic, of massacring the virtuous citizens, of plundering the city, of distributing the lands among his robbers, of overwhelming the Roman people in slavery; or, whether he is not to be allowed to do all this.",
    "Do you doubt what you are to do?",
    "\"Oh, but all this does not apply to Antonius.\"",
    "Even Cotyla would not venture to say that.",
    "For what does not apply to him?",
    "A man who, while he says that he is defending the acts of another, perverts all those laws of his which we might most properly praise.",
    "Caesar wished to drain the marshes: this man has given all Italy to that moderate man Lucius Antonius to distribute.--What?",
    "has the Roman people adopted this law?--What?",
    "could it be passed with a proper regard for the auspices?",
    "But this conscientious augur acts in reference to the auspices without his colleagues.",
    "Although those auspices do not require any interpretation;--for who is there who is ignorant that it is impious to submit any motion to the people while it is thundering?",
    "The tribunes of the people carried laws respecting the provinces in opposition to the acts of Caesar; Caesar had extended the provisions of his law over two years; Antonius over six years.",
    "Has then the Roman people adopted this law?",
    "What?",
    "was it ever regularly promulgated?",
    "What? was it not passed before it was even drawn up?",
    "Did we not see the deed done before we even suspected that it was going to be done?",
    "Where is the Caecilian and Didian law?",
    "What is become of the law that such bills should be published on three market days?",
    "What is become of the penalty appointed by the recent Junian and Licinian law?",
    "Can these laws be ratified without the destruction of all other laws?",
    "Has any one had a right of entering the forum?",
    "Moreover, what thunder, and what a storm that was!",
    "so that even if the consideration of the auspices had no weight with Marcus Antonius, it would seem strange that he could endure and bear such exceeding violence of tempest, and rain, and whirlwind.",
    "When therefore he, as augur, says that he carried a law while Jupiter was not only thundering, but almost uttering an express prohibition of it by his clamour from heaven, will he hesitate to confess that it was carried in violation of the auspices?",
    "What? does the virtuous augur think that it has nothing to do with the auspices, that he carried the law with the aid of that colleague whose election he himself vitiated by giving notice of the auspices?",
    "IV.",
    "But perhaps we, who are his colleagues, may be the interpreters of the auspices?",
    "Do we also want interpreters of arms?",
    "In the first place, all the approaches to the forum were so fenced round, that even if no armed men were standing in the way, still it would have been impossible to enter the forum except by tearing down the barricades.",
    "But the guards were arranged in such a manner, that, as the access of an enemy to a city is prevented, so you might in this instance see the burgesses and the tribunes of the people cut off by forts and works from all entrance to the forum.",
    "On which account I give my vote that those laws which Marcus Antonius is said to have carried were all carried by violence, and in violation of the auspices; and that the people is not bound by them.",
    "If Marcus Antonius is said to have carried any law about confirming the acts of Caesar and abolishing the dictatorship for ever, and of leading colonies into any lands, then I vote that those laws be passed over again, with a due regard to the auspices, so that they may bind the people.",
    "For although they may be good measures which he passed irregularly and by violence, still they are not to be accounted laws, and the whole audacity of this frantic gladiator must be repudiated by our authority.",
    "But that squandering of the public money cannot possibly be endured by which he got rid of seven hundred millions of sesterces by forged entries and deeds of gifts, so that it seems an absolute miracle that so vast a sum of money belonging to the Roman people can have disappeared in so short a time.",
    "What? are those enormous profits to be endured which the household of Marcus Antonius has swallowed up?",
    "He was continually selling forged decrees; ordering the names of kingdoms and states, and grants of exemptions to be engraved on brass, having received bribes for such orders.",
    "And his statement always was, that he was doing these things in obedience to the memoranda of Caesar, of which he himself was the author.",
    "In the interior of his house there was going on a brisk market of the whole republic.",
    "His wife, more fortunate for herself than for her husband, was holding an auction of kingdoms and provinces: exiles were restored without any law, as if by law: and unless all these acts are rescinded by the authority of the senate, now that we have again arrived at a hope of recovering the republic, there will be no likeness of a free city left to us.",
    "Nor is it only by the sale of forged memoranda and autographs that a countless sum of money was collected together in that house, while Antonius, whatever he sold, said that he was acting in obedience to the papers of Caesar; but he even took bribes to make false entries of the resolutions of the senate; to seal forged contracts; and resolutions of the senate that had never been passed were entered on the records of that treasury.",
    "Of all this baseness even foreign nations were witnesses.",
    "In the meantime treaties were made; kingdoms given away; nations and provinces released from the burdens of the state; and false memorials of all these transactions were fixed up all over the Capitol, amid the groans of the Roman people.",
    "And by all these proceedings so vast a sum of money was collected in one house, that if it were all made available, the Roman people would never want money again.",
    "V. Moreover, he passed a law to regulate judicial proceedings, this chaste and upright man, this upholder of the tribunals and the law.",
    "And in this he deceived us.",
    "He used to say that he appointed men from the front ranks of the army, common soldiers, men of the Alauda,[33] as judges.",
    "But he has in reality selected gamesters; he has selected exiles; he has selected Greeks.",
    "Oh the fine bench of judges!",
    "Oh the admirable dignity of that council!",
    "I do long to plead in behalf of some defendant before that tribunal--Cyda of Crete; a prodigy even in that island; the most audacious and abandoned of men.",
    "But even suppose he were not so.",
    "Does he understand Latin?",
    "Is he qualified by birth and station to be a judge?",
    "Does he--which is most important--does he know anything about our laws and manners?",
    "Is he even acquainted with any of the citizens?",
    "Why, Crete is better known to you than Rome is to Cyda.",
    "In fact, the selection and appointment of the judges has usually been confined to our own citizens.",
    "But who ever knew, or could possibly have known this Gortynian judge?",
    "For Lysiades, the Athenian, we most of us do know.",
    "For he is the son of Phaedrus, an eminent philosopher.",
    "And, besides, he is a witty man, so that he will be able to get on very well with Marcus Curius, who will be one of his colleagues, and with whom he is in the habit of playing.",
    "I ask if Lysiades, when summoned as a judge, should not answer to his name, and should have an excuse alleged for him that he is an Areopagite, and that he is not bound to act as a judge at both Rome and Athens at the same time, will the man who presides over the investigation admit the excuse of this Greekling judge, at one time a Greek, and at another a Roman?",
    "Or will he disregard the most ancient laws of the Athenians?",
    "And what a bench will it be, O ye good gods!",
    "A Cretan judge, and he the most worthless of men.",
    "Whom can a defendant employ to propitiate him?",
    "How is he to get at him?",
    "He comes of a hard nation.",
    "But the Athenians are merciful.",
    "I dare say that Curius, too, is not cruel, inasmuch as he is a man who is himself at the mercy of fortune every day.",
    "There are besides other chosen judges who will perhaps be excused.",
    "For they have a legitimate excuse, that they have left their country in banishment, and that they have not been restored since.",
    "And would that madman have chosen these men as judges, would he have entered their names as such in the treasury, would he have trusted a great portion of the republic to them, if he had intended to leave the least semblance of a republic?",
    "VI.",
    "And I have been speaking of those judges who are known.",
    "Those whom you are less acquainted with I have been unwilling to name.",
    "Know then that dancers, harp-players, the whole troop, in fact, of Antonius's revellers, have all been pitchforked into the third decury of judges.",
    "Now you see the object of passing so splendid and admirable a law, amid excessive rain, storm, wind, tempest, and whirlwind, amid thunder and lightning; it was that we might have those men for our judges whom no one would like to have for guests.",
    "It is the enormity of his wickedness, the consciousness of his crimes, the plunder of that money of which the account was kept in the temple of Ops, which have been the real inventors of this third decury.",
    "And infamous judges were not sought for, till all hope of safety for the guilty was despaired of, if they came before respectable ones.",
    "But what must have been the impudence, what must have been the iniquity of a man who dared to select those men as judges, by the selection of whom a double disgrace was stamped on the republic: one, because the judges were so infamous; the other, because by this step it was revealed and published to the world how many infamous citizens we had in the republic?",
    "These then, and all other similar laws, I should vote ought to be annulled, even if they had been passed without violence, and with all proper respect for the auspices.",
    "But now why need I vote that they ought to be annulled, when I do not consider that they were ever legally passed?",
    "Is not this, too, to be marked with the deepest ignominy, and with the severest animadversion of this order, so as to be recollected by all posterity, that Marcus Antonius (the first man who has ever done so since the foundation of the city) has openly taken armed men about with him in this city?",
    "A thing which the kings never did, nor those men who, since the kings have been banished, have endeavoured to seize on kingly power.",
    "I can recollect Cinna; I have seen Sylla; and lately Caesar.",
    "For these three men are the only ones since the city was delivered by Lucius Brutus, who have had more power than the entire republic.",
    "I cannot assert that no man in their trains had weapons.",
    "This I do say, that they had not many, and that they concealed them.",
    "But this pest was attended by an army of armed men.",
    "Classitius, Mustela, and Tiro, openly displaying their swords, led troops of fellows like themselves through the forum.",
    "Barbarian archers occupied their regular place in the army.",
    "And when they arrived at the temple of Concord, the steps were crowded, the litters full of shields were arranged; not because he wished the shields to be concealed, but that his friends might not be fatigued by carrying the shields themselves.",
    "VII.",
    "And what was most infamous not only to see, but even to hear of, armed men, robbers, assassins were stationed in the temple of Concord; the temple was turned into a prison; the doors of the temple were closed, and the conscript fathers delivered their opinions while robbers were standing among the benches of the senators.",
    "And if I did not come to a senate-house in this state, he, on the first of September, said that he would send carpenters and pull down my house.",
    "It was an important affair, I suppose, that was to be discussed.",
    "He made some motion about a supplication.",
    "I attended the day after.",
    "He himself did not come.",
    "I delivered my opinion about the republic, not indeed with quite so much freedom as usual, but still with more than the threats of personal danger to myself made perhaps advisable.",
    "But that violent and furious man (for Lucius Piso had done the same thing with great credit thirty days before) threatened me with his enmity, and ordered me to attend the senate on the nineteenth of September.",
    "In the meantime he spent the whole of the intervening seventeen days in the villa of Scipio, at Tibur, declaiming against me to make himself thirsty.",
    "For this is his usual object in declaiming.",
    "When the day arrived on which he had ordered me to attend, then he came with a regular army in battle array to the temple of Concord, and out of his impure mouth vomited forth an oration against me in my absence.",
    "On which day, if my friends had not prevented me from attending the senate as I was anxious to do, he would have begun a massacre by the slaughter of me.",
    "For that was what he had resolved to do.",
    "And when once he had dyed his sword in blood, nothing would have made him leave off but pure fatigue and satiety.",
    "In truth, his brother, Lucius Antonius, was present, an Asiatic gladiator, who had fought as a Mirmillo,[34] at Mylasa; he was thirsting for my blood, and had shed much of his own in that gladiatorial combat.",
    "He was now valuing our property in his mind, taking notice of our possessions in the city and in the country; his indigence united with his covetousness was threatening all our fortunes; he was distributing our lands to whomsoever and in whatever shares he pleased; no private individual could get access to him, or find any means to propitiate him, and induce him to act with justice.",
    "Every former proprietor had just so much property as Antonius left him after the division of his estate.",
    "And although all these proceedings cannot be ratified, if you annul his laws, still I think that they ought all to be separately taken note of, article by article; and that we ought formally to decide that the appointment of septemvirs was null and void; and that nothing is ratified which is said to have been done by them.",
    "VIII.",
    "But who is there who can consider Marcus Antonius a citizen, rather than a most foul and barbarous enemy, who, while sitting in front of the temple of Castor, in the hearing of the Roman people, said that no one should survive except those who were victorious?",
    "Do you suppose, O conscript fathers, that he spoke with more violence than he would act?",
    "And what are we to think of his having ventured to say that, after he had given up his magistracy, he should still be at the city with his army?",
    "that he should enter the city as often as he pleased?",
    "What else was this but threatening the Roman people with slavery?",
    "And what was the object of his journey to Brundusium?",
    "and of that great haste?",
    "What was his hope, except to lead that vast army to the city, or rather into the city?",
    "What a proceeding was that selection of the centurions!",
    "What unbridled fury of an intemperate mind!",
    "For when those gallant legions had raised an outcry against his promises, he ordered those centurions to come to him to his house, whom he perceived to be loyally attached to the republic, and then he had them all murdered before his own eyes and those of his wife, whom this noble commander had taken with him to the army.",
    "What disposition do you suppose that this man will display towards us whom he hates, when he was so cruel to those men whom he had never seen?",
    "And how covetous will he be with respect to the money of rich men, when he thirsted for even the blood of poor men?",
    "whose property, such as it was, he immediately divided among his satellites and boon companions.",
    "And he in a fury was now moving his hostile standards against his country from Brundusium, when Caius Caesar, by the kind inspiration of the immortal gods, by the greatness of his own heavenly courage, and wisdom, and genius, of his own accord, indeed, and prompted by his own admirable virtue, but still with the approbation of my authority, went down to the colonies which had been founded by his father; convoked the veteran soldiery; in a few days raised an army; and checked the furious advance of this bandit.",
    "But after the Martial legion saw this admirable leader, it had no other thoughts but those of securing our liberty.",
    "And the fourth legion followed its example.",
    "IX.",
    "And Antonius, on hearing of this news, after he had summoned the senate, and provided a man of consular rank to declare his opinion that Caius Caesar was an enemy of his country, immediately fainted away.",
    "And afterwards, without either performing the usual sacrifices, or offering the customary vows, he, I will not say went forth, but took to flight in his robe as a general.",
    "But which way did he flee?",
    "To the province of our most resolute and bravest citizens; men who could never have endured him if he had not come bringing war in his train, an intemperate, passionate, insolent, proud man, always making demands, always plundering, always drunk.",
    "But he, whose worthlessness even when quiet was more than any one could endure, has declared war upon the province of Gaul; he is besieging Mutina, a valiant and splendid colony of the Roman people; he is blockading Decimus Brutus, the general, the consul elect, a citizen born not for himself, but for us and the republic.",
    "Was then Hannibal an enemy, and is Antonius a citizen?",
    "What did the one do like an enemy, that the other has not done, or is not doing, or planning, and thinking of?",
    "What was there in the whole of the journey of the Antonii; except depopulation, devastation, slaughter, and rapine?",
    "Actions which Hannibal never did, because he was reserving many things for his own use, these men do, as men who live merely for the present hour; they never have given a thought not only to the fortunes and welfare of the citizens, but not even to their own advantage.",
    "Are we then, O ye good gods, to resolve to send ambassadors to this man?",
    "Are those men who propose this acquainted with the constitution of the republic, with the laws of war, with the precedents of our ancestors?",
    "Do they give a thought to what the majesty of the Roman people and the severity of the senate requires?",
    "Do you resolve to send ambassadors?",
    "If to beg his mercy, he will despise you; if to declare your commands he will not listen to them; and last of all, however severe the message may be which we give the ambassadors, the very name of ambassadors will extinguish this ardour of the Roman people which we see at present, and break the spirit of the municipal towns and of Italy.",
    "To say nothing of these arguments, though they are weighty, at all events that sending of an embassy will cause delay and slowness to the war.",
    "Although those who propose it should say, as I hear that some intend to say,--\"Let the ambassadors go, but let war be prepared for all the same.\"",
    "Still the very name of ambassadors will damp men's courage, and delay the rapidity of the war.",
    "X.",
    "The most important events, O conscript fathers, are often determined by very trivial moving influences in every circumstance that can happen in the republic, and also in war, and especially in civil war, which is usually governed a great deal by men's opinions and by reports.",
    "No one will ask what is the commission with which we have sent the ambassadors; the mere name of an embassy, and that sent by us of our own accord, will appear an indication of fear.",
    "Let him depart from Mutina; let him cease to attack Brutus; let him retire from Gaul.",
    "He must not be begged in words to do so; he must be compelled by arms.",
    "For we are not sending to Hannibal to desire him to retire from before Saguntum; to whom the senate formerly sent Publius Valerius Flaccus and Quintus Baebius Tampilus; who, if Hannibal did not comply, were ordered to proceed to Carthage.",
    "Whither do we order our ambassadors to proceed, if Antonius does not comply?",
    "Are we sending an embassy to our own citizen, to beg him not to attack a general and a colony of the Roman people?",
    "Is it so?",
    "Is it becoming to us to beg this by means of ambassadors?",
    "What is the difference, in the name of the immortal gods, whether he attacks this city itself, or whether he attacks an outpost of this city, a colony of the Roman people, established for the sake of its being a bulwark and protection to us?",
    "The siege of Saguntum was the cause of the second Punic war, which Hannibal carried on against our ancestors.",
    "It was quite right to send ambassadors to him.",
    "They were sent to a Carthaginian, they were sent on behalf of those who were the enemies of Hannibal, and our allies.",
    "What is there resembling that case here?",
    "We are sending to one of our own citizens to beg him not to blockade a general of the Roman army, not to attack our army and our colony,--in short, not to be an enemy of ours.",
    "Come; suppose he obeys, shall we either be inclined, or shall we be able by any possibility, to treat him as one of our citizens?",
    "XI.",
    "On the nineteenth of December, you overwhelmed him with your decrees; you ordained that this motion should be submitted to you on the first of January, which you see is submitted now, respecting the honours and rewards to be conferred on those who have deserved or do deserve well of the republic.",
    "And the chief of those men you have adjudged to be the man who really has done so, Caius Caesar, who had diverted the nefarious attacks of Marcus Antonius against this city, and compelled him to direct them against Gaul; and next to him you consider the veteran soldiers who first followed Caesar; then those excellent and heavenly-minded legions the Martial and the fourth, to whom you have promised honours and rewards, for having not only abandoned their consul, but for having even declared war against him.",
    "And on the same day, having a decree brought before you and published on purpose, you praised the conduct of Decimus Brutus, a most excellent citizen, and sanctioned with your public authority this war which he had undertaken of his own head.",
    "What else, then, did you do on that day except pronounce Antonius a public enemy?",
    "After these decrees of yours, will it be possible for him to look upon you with equanimity, or for you to behold him without the most excessive indignation?",
    "He has been excluded and cut off and wholly separated from the republic, not merely by his own wickedness, as it seems to me, but by some especial good fortune of the republic.",
    "And if he should comply with the demands of the ambassadors and return to Rome, do you suppose that abandoned citizens will ever be in need of a standard around which to rally?",
    "But this is not what I am so much afraid of.",
    "There are other things which I am more apprehensive of and more alarmed at.",
    "He never will comply with the demands of the ambassadors.",
    "I know the man's insanity and arrogance; I know the desperate counsels of his friends, to which he is wholly given up.",
    "Lucius his brother, as being a man who has fought abroad, leads on his household.",
    "Even suppose him to be in his senses himself, which he never will be; still he will not be allowed by these men to act as if he were so.",
    "In the mean time, time will be wasted.",
    "The preparations for war will cool.",
    "How is it that the war has been protracted as long as this, if it be not by procrastination and delay?",
    "From the very first moment after the departure, or rather after the hopeless flight of that bandit, that the senate could have met in freedom, I have always been demanding that we should be called together.",
    "The first day that we were called together, when the consuls elect were not present, I laid, in my opinion, amid the greatest unanimity on your part, the foundations of the republic, later, indeed, than they should have been laid, for I could not do so before, but still if no time had been lost after that day, we should have no war at all now.",
    "Every evil is easily crushed at its birth, when it has become of long standing, it usually gets stronger.",
    "But then everybody was waiting for the first of January, perhaps not very wisely.",
    "XII",
    "However, let us say no more of what is past.",
    "Are we still to allow any further delay while the ambassadors are on their road to him?",
    "and while they are coming back again?",
    "and the time spent in waiting for them will make men doubt about the war.",
    "And while the fact of the war is in doubt, how can men possibly be zealous about the levies for the army?",
    "Wherefore, O conscript fathers, I give my vote that there should be no mention made of ambassadors I think that the business that is to be done must be done without any delay, and instantly.",
    "I say that it is necessary that we should decree that there is sedition abroad, that we should suspend the regular courts of justice, order all men to wear the garb of war, and enlist men in all quarters, suspending all exemptions from military service in the city and in all Italy, except in Gaul.",
    "And if this be done, the general opinion and report of your severity will overwhelm the insanity of that wicked gladiator.",
    "He will feel that he has undertaken a war against the republic, he will experience the sinews and vigour of a unanimous senate For at present he is constantly saying that it is a mere struggle between parties.",
    "Between what parties?",
    "One party is defeated, the other is the heart of Caius Caesar's party.",
    "Unless, indeed, we believe that the party of Caesar is attacked by Pansa and Hirtius the consuls, and by Caius Caesar's son.",
    "But this war has been kindled, not by a struggle between parties, but by the nefarious hopes of the most abandoned citizens, by whom all our estates and properties have been marked down, and already distributed according as every one has thought them desirable.",
    "I have read the letter of Antonius which he sent to one of the septemviri, a thoroughpaced scoundrel, a colleague of his own, \"Look out, and see what you take a fancy to, what you do fancy you shall certainly have\".",
    "See to what a man we are sending ambassadors, against what a man we are delaying to make war, a man who does not even let us draw lots for our fortunes, but hands us over to each man's caprice in such a way, that he has not left even himself anything untouched, or which has not been promised to somebody.",
    "With this man, O conscript fathers, we must wage war,--war, I say, and that instantly.",
    "We must reject the slow proceedings of ambassadors.",
    "Therefore, that we may not have a number of decrees to pass every day, I give my vote that the whole republic should be committed to the consuls, and that they should have a charge given them to defend the republic, and to take care \"that the republic suffer no injury.\"",
    "And I give my vote that those men who are in the army of Antonius be not visited with blame, if they leave him before the first of February.",
    "If you adopt these proposals of mine, O conscript fathers, you will in a short time recover the liberty of the Roman people and our own authority.",
    "But if you act with more mildness, still you will pass those resolutions, but perhaps you will pass them too late.",
    "As to the general welfare of the republic, on which you, O consuls, have consulted us, I think that I have proposed what is sufficient.",
    "XIII.",
    "The next question is about honours.",
    "And to this point I perceive that I must speak next.",
    "But I will preserve the same order in paying respect to brave men, that is usually preserved in asking their opinions.",
    "Let us, therefore, according to the usages of our ancestors, begin with Brutus, the consul elect, and, to say nothing of his former conduct,--which has indeed been most admirable, but still such as has been praised by the individual judgments of men, rather than by public",
    "authority,--what words can we find adequate to his praise at this very time?",
    "For such great virtue requires no reward except this one of praise and glory; and even if it were not to receive that, still it would be content with itself, and would rejoice at being laid up in the recollection of grateful citizens, as if it were placed in the full light.",
    "The praise then of our deliberate opinion, and of our testimony in his favour, must be given to Brutus.",
    "Therefore, O conscript fathers, I give my vote that a resolution of the senate be passed in these words: \"As Decimus Brutus, imperator, consul elect is maintaining the province of Gaul in obedience to the senate and people of Rome, and as he has enlisted and collected in so short a time a very numerous army, being aided by the admirable zeal of the municipal towns and colonies of the province of Gaul, which has deserved and still does deserve admirably well of the republic, he has acted rightly and virtuously, and greatly for the advantage of the republic.",
    "And that most excellent service done by Decimus Brutus to the republic, is and always will be grateful to the senate and people of Rome.",
    "Therefore, the senate and the Roman people is of opinion that the exertions, and prudence, and virtue of Decimus Brutus, imperator and consul elect, and the incredible zeal and unanimity of the province of Gaul, have been a great assistance to the republic, at a most critical time.\"",
    "What honour, O conscript fathers, can be too great to be due to such a mighty service as this of Brutus, and to such important aid as he has afforded the republic?",
    "For if Gaul had been open to Marcus Antonius--if after having overwhelmed the municipal towns and colonies unprepared to resist him, he had been able to penetrate into that further Gaul--what great danger would have hung over the republic!",
    "That most insane of men, that man so headlong and furious in all his courses, would have been likely, I suppose, to hesitate at waging war against us, not only with his own army, but with all the savage troops of barbarism, so that even the wall of the Alps would not have enabled us to check his frenzy.",
    "These thanks then will be deservedly paid to Decimus Brutus, who, before any authority of yours had been interposed, acting on his own judgment and responsibility, refused to receive him as consul, but repelled him from Gaul as an enemy, and preferred to be besieged himself rather than to allow this city to be so.",
    "Let him therefore have, by your decree, an everlasting testimony to this most important and glorious action, and let Gaul,[35] which always is and has been a protection to this empire and to the general liberty, be deservedly and truly praised for not having surrendered herself and her power to Antonius, but for having opposed him with them.",
    "XIV.",
    "And, furthermore, I give my vote that the most ample honours be decreed to Marcus Lepidus, as a reward for his eminent services to the republic.",
    "He has at all times wished the Roman people to be free, and he gave the greatest proof of his inclination and opinion on that day, when, while Antonius was placing the diadem on Caesar's head, he turned his face away, and by his groans and sorrow showed plainly what a hatred of slavery he had, how desirous he was for the Roman people to be free, and how he had endured those things which he had endured more because of the necessity of the times, than because they harmonised with his sentiments.",
    "And who of us can forget with what great moderation he behaved during that crisis of the city which ensued after the death of Caesar?",
    "These are great merits, but I hasten to speak of greater still.",
    "For, (O ye immortal gods!)",
    "what could happen more to be admired by foreign nations or more to be desired by the Roman people, than, at a time when there was a most important civil war, the result of which we were all dreading, that it should be extinguished by prudence rather than that arms and violence should be able to put everything to the hazard of a battle?",
    "And if Caesar had been guided by the same principles in that odious and miserable war, we should have--to say nothing of their father--the two sons of Cnaeus Pompeius, that most illustrious and virtuous man, safe among us, men whose piety and filial affection certainly ought not to have been their ruin.",
    "Would that Marcus Lepidus had been able to save them all!",
    "He showed that he would have done so, by his conduct in cases where he had the power, when he restored Sextus Pompeius to the state, a great ornament to the republic, and a most illustrious monument of his clemency.",
    "Sad was that picture, melancholy was the destiny then of the Roman people.",
    "For after Pompeius the father was dead, he who was the light of the Roman people, the son too, who was wholly like his father, was also slain.",
    "But all these calamities appear to me to have been effaced by the kindness of the immortal gods, Sextus Pompeius being preserved to the republic.",
    "XV.",
    "For which cause, reasonable and important as it is and because Marcus Lepidus, by his humanity and wisdom, has changed a most dangerous and extensive civil war into peace and concord, I give my vote, that a resolution of the senate be drawn up in these words: \"Since the affairs of the republic have repeatedly been well and prosperously conducted by Marcus Lepidus, imperator, and Pontifex Maximus, and since the Roman people is fully aware that kingly power is very displeasing to him; and since by his exertions, and virtue, and prudence, and singular clemency and humanity, a most bitter civil war has been extinguished; and Sextus Pompeius Magnus, the son of Cnaeus, having submitted to the authority of this order and laid down his arms, and, in accordance with the perfect good-will of the senate and people of Rome, has been restored to the state by Marcus Lepidus, imperator, and Pontifex Maximus; the senate and people of Rome, in return for the important and numerous services of Marcus Lepidus to the republic, declares that it places great hopes of future tranquillity and peace and concord, in his virtue, authority, and good fortune; and the senate and people of Rome will ever remember his services to the republic; and it is decreed by the vote of this order, That a gilt equestrian statue be erected to him in the Rostra, or in whatever other place in the forum he pleases.\"",
    "And this honour, O conscript fathers, appears to me a very great one, in the first place, because it is just;--for it is not merely given on account of our hopes of the future, but it is paid, as it were, in requital of his ample services already done.",
    "Nor are we able to mention any instance of this honour having been conferred on any one by the senate by their own free and voluntary judgment before.",
    "XVI.",
    "I come now to Caius Caesar, O conscript fathers; if he had not existed, which of us could have been alive now?",
    "That most intemperate of men, Antonius, was flying from Brundusium to the city, burning with hatred, with a disposition hostile to all good men, with an army.",
    "What was there to oppose to his audacity and wickedness?",
    "We had not as yet any generals, or any forces.",
    "There was no public council, no liberty; our necks were at the mercy of his nefarious cruelty; we were all preparing to have recourse to flight, though flight itself had no escape for us.",
    "Who was it--what god was it, who at that time gave to the Roman people this godlike young man, who, while every means for completing our destruction seemed open to that most pernicious citizen, rising up on a sudden, beyond every one's hope, completed an army fit to oppose to the fury of Marcus Antonius before any one suspected that he was thinking of any such step?",
    "Great honours were paid to Cnaeus Pompeius when he was a young man, and deservedly; for he came to the assistance of the republic; but he was of a more vigorous age, and more calculated to meet the eager requirements of soldiers seeking a general.",
    "He had also been already trained in other kinds of war.",
    "For the cause of Sylla was not agreeable to all men.",
    "The multitude of the proscribed, and the enormous calamities that fell on so many municipal towns, show this plainly.",
    "But Caesar, though many years younger, armed veterans who were now eager to rest; he has embraced that cause which was most agreeable to the senate, to the people, to all Italy,--in short, to gods and men.",
    "And Pompeius came as a reinforcement to the extensive command and victorious army of Lucius Sylla; Caesar had no one to join himself to.",
    "He, of his own accord, was the author and executor of his plan of levying an army, and arraying a defence for us.",
    "Pompeius found the whole Picene district hostile to the party of his adversaries; but Caesar has levied an army against Antonius from men who were Antonius's own friends, but still greater friends to liberty.",
    "It was owing to the influence of Pompeius that Sylla was enabled to act like a king.",
    "It is by the protection afforded us by Caesar that the tyranny of Antonius has been put down.",
    "Let us then confer on Caesar a regular military command, without which the military affairs cannot be directed, the army cannot be held together, war cannot be waged.",
    "Let him be made proprietor with all the privileges which have ever been attached to that appointment.",
    "That honour, although it is a great one for a man of his age, still is not merely of influence as giving dignity, but it confers powers calculated to meet the present emergency.",
    "Therefore, let us seek for honours for him which we shall not easily find at the present day.",
    "XVII.",
    "But I hope that we and the Roman people shall often have an opportunity of complimenting and honouring this young man.",
    "But at the present moment I give my vote that we should pass a decree in this form: \"As Caius Caesar, the son of Caius, Pontiff and Propraetor, has at a most critical period of the republic exhorted the veteran soldiers to defend the liberty of the Roman people, and has enlisted them in his army, and as the Martial legion and the fourth legion, with great zeal for the republic, and with admirable unanimity, under the guidance and authority of Caius Caesar, have defended and are defending the republic and the liberty of the Roman people, and as Caius Caesar, propraetor, has gone with his army as a reinforcement to the province of Gaul, has made cavalry, and archers, and elephants, obedient to himself and to the Roman people, and has, at a most critical time for the republic, come to the aid of the safety and dignity of the Roman people,--on these accounts, it seems good to the senate that Caius Caesar, the son of Caius, pontiff and propraetor, shall be a senator, and shall deliver his opinions from the bench occupied by men of praetorian rank, and that, on occasion of his offering himself for any magistracy, he shall be considered of the same legal standing and qualification as if he had been quaestor the preceding year.\"",
    "For what reason can there be, O conscript fathers, why we should not wish him to arrive at the highest honours at as early an age as possible?",
    "For when, by the laws fixing the age at which men might be appointed to the different magistracies our ancestors fixed a more mature age for the consulship, they were influenced by fears of the precipitation of youth, Caius Caesar, at his first entrance into life, has shown us that, in the case of his eminent and unparalleled virtue, we have no need to wait for the progress of age.",
    "Therefore our ancestors, those old men, in the most ancient times, had no laws regulating the age for the different offices, it was ambition which caused them to be passed many years afterwards, in order that there might be among men of the same age different steps for arriving at honours.",
    "And it has often happened that a disposition of great natural virtue has been lost before it had any opportunity of benefiting the republic.",
    "But among the ancients, the Rulii, the Decii, the Corvim, and many others, and in more modern times the elder Africanus and Titus Flaminius were made consuls very young, and performed such exploits as greatly to extend the empire of the Roman people, and to embellish its name.",
    "What more?",
    "Did not the Macedonian Alexander, having begun to perform mighty deeds from his earliest youth, die when he was only in his thirty-third year?",
    "And that age is ten years less than that fixed by our laws for a man to be eligible for the consulship.",
    "From which it may be plainly seen that the progress of virtue is often swifter than that of age.",
    "XVIII.",
    "For as to the fear which those men, who are enemies of Caesar, pretend to entertain, there is not the slightest reason to apprehend that he will be unable to restrain and govern himself, or that he will be so elated by the honours which he receives from us as to use his power with out moderation.",
    "It is only natural, O conscript fathers, that the man who has learnt to appreciate real glory, and who feels that he is considered by the senate and by the Roman knights and the whole Roman people a citizen who is dear to, and a blessing to the republic, should think nothing whatever deserving of being compared to this glory.",
    "Would that it had happened to Caius Caesar--the father, I mean--when he was a young man, to be beloved by the senate and by every virtuous citizen, but, having neglected to aim at that, he wasted all the power of genius which he had in a most brilliant degree, in a capricious pursuit of popular favour.",
    "Therefore, as he had not sufficient respect for the senate and the virtuous part of the citizens, he opened for himself that path for the extension of his power, which the virtue of a free people was unable to bear.",
    "But the principles of his son are widely different; who is not only beloved by every one, but in the greatest degree by the most virtuous men.",
    "In him is placed all our hope of liberty, from him already has our safety been received, for him the highest honours are sought out and prepared.",
    "While therefore we are admiring his singular prudence, can we at the same time fear his folly?",
    "For what can be more foolish than to prefer useless power, such influence as brings envy in its train, and a rash and slippery ambition of reigning, to real, dignified, solid glory?",
    "Has he seen this truth as a boy, and when he has advanced in age will he cease to see it?",
    "\"But he is an enemy to some most illustrious and excellent citizens.\"",
    "That circumstance ought not to cause any fear Caesar has sacrificed all those enmities to the republic; he had made the republic his judge; he has made her the directress of all his counsels and actions.",
    "For he is come to the service of the republic in order to strengthen her, not to overturn her.",
    "I am well acquainted with all the feelings of the young man: there is nothing dearer to him than the republic, nothing which he considers of more weight than your authority; nothing which he desires more than the approbation of virtuous men; nothing which he accounts sweeter than genuine glory.",
    "Wherefore you not only ought not to fear anything from him, but you ought to expect greater and better things still.",
    "Nor ought you to apprehend with respect to a man who has already gone forward to release Decimus Brutus from a siege, that the recollection of his domestic injury will dwell in his bosom, and have more weight with him than the safety of the city.",
    "I will venture even to pledge my own faith, O conscript fathers, to you, and to the Roman people, and to the republic, which in truth, if no necessity compelled me to do so, I would not venture to do, and in doing which on slight grounds, I should be afraid of giving rise to a dangerous opinion of my rashness in a most important business; but I do promise, and pledge myself, and undertake, O conscript fathers, that Caius Caesar will always be such a citizen as he is this day, and as we ought above all things to wish and desire that he may turn out.",
    "XIX.",
    "And as this is the case, I shall consider that I have said enough at present about Caesar.",
    "Nor do I think that we ought to pass over Lucius Egnatuleius, a most gallant and wise and firm citizen, and one thoroughly attached to the republic, in silence; but that we ought to give him our testimony to his admirable virtue, because it was he who led the fourth legion to Caesar, to be a protection to the consuls, and senate, and people of Rome, and the republic.",
    "And for these acts I give my vote: \"That it be made lawful for Lucius Egnatuleius to stand for, and be elected to, and discharge the duties of any magistracy, three years before the legitimate time.\"",
    "And by this motion, O conscript fathers, Lucius Egnatuleius does not get so much actual advantage as honour.",
    "For in a case like this it is quite sufficient to be honourably mentioned.",
    "But concerning the army of Caius Caesar, I give my vote for the passing of a decree in this form: \"The senate decrees that the veteran soldiers who have defended and are defending [lacuna] of Caesar, pontiff [lacuna] and the authority of this order, should, and their children after them, have an exemption from military service.",
    "And that Caius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius the consuls, one or both of them, as they think fit, shall inquire what land there is in those colonies in which the veteran soldiers have been settled, which is occupied in defiance of the provisions of the Julian law, in order that that may be divided among these veterans.",
    "That they shall institute a separate inquiry about the Campanian district, and devise a plan for increasing the advantages enjoyed by these veteran soldiers; and with respect to the Martial legion, and to the fourth legion, and to those soldiers of the second and thirty-fifth legions who have come over to Caius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius the consuls, and have given in their names, because the authority of the senate and the liberty of the Roman people is and always has been most dear to them, the senate decrees that they and their children shall have exemption from military service, except in the case of any Gallic and Italian sedition; and decrees further, that those legions shall have their discharge when this war is terminated; and that whatever sum of money Caius Caesar, pontiff and propraetor, has promised to the soldiers of those legions individually, shall be paid to them.",
    "And that Caius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius the consuls, one or both of them, as it seems good to them, shall make an estimate of the land which can be distributed without injury to private individuals; and that land shall be given and assigned to the soldiers of the Martial legion and of the fourth legion, in the largest shares in which land has ever been given and assigned to soldiers.\"",
    "I have now spoken, O consuls, on every point concerning which you have submitted a motion to us; and if the resolutions which I have proposed be decreed without delay, and seasonably, you will the more easily prepare those measures which the present time and emergency demand.",
    "But instant action is necessary.",
    "And if we had adopted that earlier, we should, as I have often said, now have no war at all.",
    "THE SIXTH ORATION OF M. T CICERO AGAINST MARCUS ANTONIUS CALLED ALSO THE SIXTH PHILIPPIC.",
    "ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE.",
    "THE ARGUMENT",
    "In respect of the honours proposed by Cicero in the last speech the senate agreed with him, voting to Octavius honours beyond any that Cicero had proposed.",
    "But they were much divided about the question of sending an embassy to Antonius, and the consuls, seeing that a majority agreed with Cicero, adjourned the debate till the next day.",
    "The discussion lasted three days, and the senate would at last have adopted all Cicero's measures if one of the tribunes, Salvius, had not put his veto on them.",
    "So that at last the embassy was ordered to be sent, and Servius Sulpicius, Lucius Piso, and Lucius Philippus, appointed as the ambassadors, but they were charged merely to order Antonius to abandon the siege of Mutina, and to desist from hostilities against the province of Gaul, and further, to proceed to Decimus Brutus in Mutina, and to give him and his army the thanks of the senate and people.",
    "The length of the debates roused the curiosity of the people, who, being assembled in the forum to learn the result, called on Cicero to come forth and give them an account of what had been done--on which he went to the rostra, accompanied by Publius Appuleius the tribune, and related to them all that had passed in the following speech:",
    "I. I imagine that you have heard, O Romans, what has been done in the senate, and what has been the opinion delivered by each individual.",
    "For the matter which has been in discussion ever since the first of January, has been just brought to a conclusion, with less severity indeed than it ought to have been, but still in a manner not altogether unbecoming.",
    "The war has been subjected to a delay, but the cause has not been removed.",
    "Wherefore, as to the question which Publius Appuleius--a man united to me by many kind offices and by the closest intimacy, and firmly attached to your interests--has asked me, I will answer in such a manner that you may be acquainted with the transactions at which you were not present.",
    "The cause which prompted our most fearless and excellent consuls to submit a motion on the first of January, concerning the general state of the republic, arose from the decree which the senate passed by my advice on the nineteenth of December.",
    "On that day, O Romans, were the foundations of the republic first laid.",
    "For then, after a long interval, the senate was free in such a manner that you too might become free.",
    "On which day, indeed,--even if it had been to bring to me the end of my life,--I received a sufficient reward for my exertions, when you all with one heart and one voice cried out together, that the republic had been a second time saved by me.",
    "Stimulated by so important",
    "and so splendid a decision of yours in my favour, I came into the senate on the first of January, with the feeling that I was bound to show my recollection of the character which you had imposed upon me, and which I had to sustain.",
    "Therefore, when I saw that a nefarious war was waged against the republic, I thought that no delay ought to be interposed to our pursuit of Marcus Antonius; and I gave my vote that we ought to pursue with war that most audacious man, who, having committed many atrocious crimes before, was at this moment attacking a general of the Roman people, and besieging your most faithful and gallant colony; and that a state of civil war ought to be proclaimed; and I said further, that my opinion was that a suspension of the ordinary forms of justice should be declared, and that the garb of war should be assumed by the citizens, in order that all men might apply themselves with more activity and energy to avenging the injuries of the republic, if they saw that all the emblems of a regular war had been adopted by the senate.",
    "Therefore, this opinion of mine, O Romans, prevailed so much for three days, that although no division was come to, still all, except a very few, appeared inclined to agree with me.",
    "But to-day--I know not owing to what circumstance--the senate was more indulgent.",
    "For the majority decided on our making experiment, by means of ambassadors, how much influence the authority of the senate and your unanimity will have upon Antonius.",
    "II.",
    "I am well aware, O Romans, that this decision is disapproved of by you; and reasonably too.",
    "For to whom are we sending ambassadors?",
    "Is it not to him who, after having dissipated and squandered the public money, and imposed laws on the Roman people by violence and in violation of the auspices,--after having put the assembly of the people to flight and besieged the senate, sent for the legions from Brundusium to oppress the republic?",
    "who, when deserted by them, has invaded Gaul with a troop of banditti?",
    "who is attacking Brutus?",
    "who is besieging Mutina?",
    "How can you offer conditions to, or expect equity from, or send an embassy to, or, in short, have anything in common with, this gladiator?",
    "although, O Romans, it is not an embassy, but a denunciation of war if he does not obey.",
    "For the decree has been drawn up as if ambassadors were being sent to Hannibal.",
    "For men are sent to order him not to attack the consul elect, not to besiege Mutina, not to lay waste the province, not to enlist troops, but to submit himself to the power of the senate and people of Rome.",
    "No doubt he is a likely man to obey this injunction, and to submit to the power of the conscript fathers and to yours, who has never even had any mastery over himself.",
    "For what has he ever done that showed any discretion, being always led away wherever his lust, or his levity, or his frenzy, or his drunkenness has hurried him?",
    "He has always been under the dominion of two very dissimilar classes of men, pimps and robbers; he is so fond of domestic adulteries and forensic murders, that he would rather obey a most covetous woman than the senate and people of Rome.",
    "III.",
    "Therefore, I will do now before you what I have just done in the senate.",
    "I call you to witness, I give notice, I predict beforehand, that Marcus Antonius will do nothing whatever of those things which the ambassadors are commissioned to command him to do; but that he will lay waste the lands, and besiege Mutina and enlist soldiers, wherever he can.",
    "For he is a man who has at all times despised the judgment and authority of the senate, and your inclinations and power.",
    "Will he do what it has been just now decreed that he shall do,--lead his army back across the Rubicon, which is the frontier of Gaul, and yet at the same time not come nearer Rome than two hundred miles?",
    "will he obey this notice?",
    "will he allow himself to be confined by the river Rubicon and by the limit of two hundred miles?",
    "Antonius is not that sort of man.",
    "For if he had been, he would never have allowed matters to come to such a pass, as for the senate to give him notice, as it did to Hannibal at the beginning of the Punic war not to attack Saguntum.",
    "But what ignominy it is to be called away from Mutina, and at the same time to be forbidden to approach the city as if he were some fatal conflagration!",
    "what an opinion is this for the senate to have of a man!",
    "What?",
    "As to the commission which is given to the ambassadors to visit Decimus Brutus and his soldiers, and to inform them that their excellent zeal in behalf of, and services done to the republic, are acceptable to the senate and people of Rome, and that that conduct shall tend to their great glory and to their great honour; do you think that Antonius will permit the ambassadors to enter Mutina?",
    "and to depart from thence in safety?",
    "He never will allow it, believe me.",
    "I know the violence of the man, I know his impudence, I know his audacity.",
    "Nor, indeed, ought we to think of him as of a human being, but as of a most ill-omened beast.",
    "And as this is the case, the decree which the senate has passed is not wholly improper.",
    "The embassy has some severity in it; I only wish it had no delay.",
    "For as in the conduct of almost every affair slowness and procrastination are hateful, so above all things does this war require promptness of action.",
    "We must assist Decimus Brutus; we must collect all our forces from all quarters; we cannot lose a single hour in effecting the deliverance of such a citizen without wickedness.",
    "Was it not in his power, if he had considered Antonius a consul, and Gaul the province of Antonius, to have given over the legions and the province to Antonius? and to return home himself?",
    "and to celebrate a triumph?",
    "and to be the first man in this body to deliver his opinion, until he entered on his magistracy?",
    "What was the difficulty of doing that?",
    "But as he remembered that he was Brutus, and that he was born for your freedom, not for his own tranquillity, what else did he do but--as I may almost say--put his own body in the way to prevent Antonius from entering Gaul?",
    "Ought we then to send ambassadors to this man, or legions?",
    "However, we will say nothing of what is past.",
    "Let the ambassadors hasten, as I see that they are about to do.",
    "Do you prepare your robes of war.",
    "For it has been decreed, that, if he does not obey the authority of the senate, we are all to betake our selves to our military dress.",
    "And we shall have to do so.",
    "He will never obey.",
    "And we shall lament that we have lost so many days, when we might have been doing something.",
    "IV I have no fear, O Romans, that when Antonius hears that I have asserted, both in the senate and in the assembly of the people, that he never will submit himself to the power of the senate, he will, for the sake of disproving my words, and making me to appeal to have had no foresight, alter his behaviour and obey the senate.",
    "He will never do so.",
    "He will not grudge me this part of my reputation, he will prefer letting me be thought wise by you to being thought modest himself.",
    "Need I say more?",
    "Even if he were willing to do so himself, do you think that his brother Lucius would permit him?",
    "It has been reported that lately at Tibur, when Marcus Antonius appeared to him to be wavering, he, Lucius, threatened his brother with death.",
    "And do we suppose that the orders of the senate, and the words of the ambassadors, will be listened to by this Asiatic gladiator?",
    "It will be impossible for him to be separated from a brother, especially from one of so much authority.",
    "For he is another Africanus among them.",
    "He is considered of more influence than Lucius Trebellius, of more than Titus Plancus",
    "[lacuna] a noble young man.",
    "As for Plancus, who, having been condemned by the unanimous vote of every one, amid the overpowering applause of you yourselves, somehow or other got mixed up in this crowd, and returned with a countenance so sorrowful, that he appeared to have been dragged back rather than to have returned, he despises him to such degree, as if he were interdicted from fire and water.",
    "At times he says that that man who set the senate house on fire has no right to a place in the senate house.",
    "For at this moment he is exceedingly in love with Trebellius.",
    "He hated him some time ago, when he was opposing an abolition of debts, but now he delights in him, ever since he has seen that Trebellius himself cannot continue in safety without an abolition of debts.",
    "For I think that you have heard, O Romans, what indeed you may possibly have seen, that the sureties and creditors of Lucius Trebellius meet every day.",
    "Oh confidence!",
    "for I imagine that Trebellius has taken this surname, what can be greater confidence than defrauding one's creditors?",
    "than flying from one's house?",
    "than, because of one's debts, being forced to go to war?",

    "Some pretend that his demand is that all the armies be disbanded.",
    "I suppose then we sent ambassadors to him, not that he should submit and obey this our body, but that he should offer us conditions, impose laws upon us, order us to open Italy to foreign nations, especially while we were to leave him in safety from whom there is more danger to be feared than from any nation whatever.",

    "Is not this the way in which they argue?",
    "\"Antonius ought not to have been irritated, he is a reckless and a bold man, there are many bad men besides him.\"",
    "(No doubt, and they may begin and count themselves first).",
    "And they warn us to be on our guard against them.",
    "Which conduct then is it which shows the more prudent caution chastising wicked citizens when one is able to do so, or fearing them?",
    "II.",
    "And these men speak in this way, who on account of their trifling disposition used to be considered friends of the people.",
    "From which it may be understood that they in their hearts have at all times been disinclined to a good constitution of the state, and they were not friends of the people from inclination.",
    "For how comes it to pass that those men who were anxious to gratify the people in evil things, now, on an occasion which above all others concerns the people's interests, because the same thing would be also salutary for the republic, now prefer being wicked to being friends of the people?",
    "This noble cause of which I am the advocate has made me popular, a man who (as you know) have always opposed the rashness of the people.",
    "And those men are called, or rather they call themselves, consulars; though no man is worthy of that name except those who can support so high an honour.",
    "Will you favour an enemy?",
    "Will you let him send you letters about his hopes of success?",
    "Will you be glad to produce them?",
    "to read them?",
    "Will you even give them to wicked citizens to take copies of?",
    "Will you thus raise their courage?",
    "Will you thus damp the hopes and valour of the good?",
    "And then will you think yourself a consular, or a senator, or even a citizen?",
    "Caius Pansa, a most fearless and virtuous consul, will take what I say in good part.",
    "For I will speak with a disposition most friendly to him; but I should not consider him himself a consul, though a man with whom I am most intimate, unless he was such a consul as to devote all his vigilance, and cares, and thoughts to the safety of the republic.",
    "Although long acquaintance, and habit, and a fellowship and resemblance in the most honourable pursuits, has bound us together from his first entrance into life; and his incredible diligence, proved at the time of the most formidable dangers of the civil war, showed that he was a favourer not only of my safety, but also of my dignity; still, as I said before, if he were not such a consul as I have described, I should venture to deny that he was a consul at all.",
    "But now I call him not only a consul, but the most excellent and virtuous consul within my recollection; not but that there have been others of equal virtue and equal inclination, but still they have not had an equal opportunity of displaying that virtue and inclination.",
    "But the opportunity of a time of most formidable change has been afforded to his magnanimity, and dignity, and wisdom.",
    "And that is the time when the consulship is displayed to the greatest advantage, when it governs the republic during a time which, if not desirable, is at all events critical and momentous.",
    "And a more critical time than the present, O conscript fathers, never was.",
    "III.",
    "Therefore I, who have been at all times an adviser of peace, and who, though all good men always considered peace, and especially internal peace, desirable, have desired it more than all of them;--for the whole of the career of my industry has been passed in the forum and in the senate-house, and in warding off dangers from my friends; it is by this course that I have arrived at the highest honours, at moderate wealth, and at any dignity which we may be thought to have: I therefore, a nursling of peace, as I may call myself, I who, whatever I am, (for I arrogate nothing to myself,) should undoubtedly not have been such without internal peace: I am speaking in peril: I shudder to think how you will receive it, O conscript fathers: but still, out of regard for my unceasing desire to support and increase your dignity, I beg and entreat you, O conscript fathers, although it may be a bitter thing to hear, or an incredible thing that it should be said by Marcus Cicero, still to receive at first, without offence, what I am going to say, and not to reject it before I have fully explained what it is;--I, who, I will say so over and over again, have always been a panegyrist, have always been an adviser of peace, do not wish to have peace with Marcus Antonius.",
    "I approach the rest of my speech with great hope, O conscript fathers, since I have now passed by that perilous point amid your silence.",
    "Why then do I not wish for peace?",
    "Because it would be shameful; because it would be dangerous; because it cannot possibly be real.",
    "And while I explain these three points to you, I beg of you, O conscript fathers, to listen to my words with the same kindness which you usually show to me.",
    "What is more shameful than inconsistency, fickleness, and levity, both to individuals, and also to the entire senate?",
    "Moreover, what can be more inconsistent than on a sudden to be willing to be united in peace with a man whom you have lately adjudged to be an enemy, not by words, but by actions and by many formal decrees?",
    "Unless, indeed, when you were decreeing honours to Caius Caesar, well-deserved indeed by and fairly due to him, but still unprecedented and never to be forgotten, for one single reason,--because he had levied an army against Marcus Antonius,--you were not judging Marcus Antonius to be an enemy; and unless Antonius was not pronounced an enemy by you, when the veteran soldiers were praised by your authority, for having followed Caesar; and unless you did not declare Antonius an enemy when you promised exemptions and money and lands to those brave legions, because they had deserted him who was consul while he was an enemy.",
    "IV.",
    "What?",
    "when you distinguished with the highest praises Brutus, a man born under some omen, as it were, of his race and name, for the deliverance of the republic, and his army, which was waging war against Antonius on behalf of the liberty of the Roman people, and the most loyal and admirable province of Gaul, did you not then pronounce Antonius an enemy?",
    "What?",
    "when you decreed that the consuls, one or both of them, should go to the war, what war was there if Antonius was not an enemy?",
    "Why then was it that most gallant man, my own colleague and intimate friend, Aulus Hirtius the consul, has set out?",
    "And in what delicate health he is; how wasted away!",
    "But the weak state of his body could not repress the vigour of his mind.",
    "He thought it fair, I suppose, to expose to danger in defence of the Roman people that life which had been preserved to him by their prayers.",
    "What?",
    "when you ordered levies of troops to be made throughout all Italy, when you suspended all exemptions from service, was he not by those steps declared to be an enemy?",
    "You see manufactories of arms in the city; soldiers, sword in hand, are following the consul; they are in appearance a guard to the consul, but in fact and reality to us; all men are giving in their names, not only without any shirking, but with the greatest eagerness; they are acting in obedience to your authority.",
    "Has not Antonius been declared an enemy by such acts?",
    "\"Oh, but we have sent ambassadors to him.\"",
    "Alas, wretched that I am!",
    "why am I compelled to find fault with the senate whom I have always praised?",
    "Why?",
    "Do you think, O conscript fathers, that you have induced the Roman people to approve of the sending ambassadors?",
    "Do you not perceive, do you not hear, that the adoption of my opinion is demanded by them?",
    "that opinion which you, in a full house, agreed to the day before, though the day after you allowed yourselves to be brought down to a groundless hope of peace.",
    "Moreover, how shameful it is for the legions to send out ambassadors to the senate, and the senate to Antonius!",
    "Although that is not an embassy; it is a denunciation that destruction is prepared for him if he do not submit to this order.",
    "What is the difference?",
    "At all events, men's opinions are unfavourable to the measure; for all men see that ambassadors have been sent, but it is not all who are acquainted with the terms of your decree.",
    "V. You must, therefore, preserve your consistency, your wisdom, your firmness, your perseverance.",
    "You must go back to the old-fashioned severity, if at least the authority of the senate is anxious to establish its credit, its honour, its renown, and its dignity, things which this order has been too long deprived of.",
    "But there was some time ago some excuse for it, as being oppressed; a miserable excuse indeed, but still a fair one; now there is none.",
    "We appeared to have been delivered from kingly tyranny; and afterwards we were oppressed much more severely by domestic enemies.",
    "We did indeed turn their arms aside; we must now wrest them from their hands.",
    "And if we cannot do so, (I will say what it becomes one who is both a senator and a Roman to say,) let us die.",
    "For how just will be the shame, how great will be the disgrace, how great the infamy to the republic, if Marcus Antonius can deliver his opinion in this assembly from the consular bench.",
    "For, to say nothing of the countless acts of wickedness committed by him while consul in the city, during which time he has squandered a vast amount of public money, restored exiles without any law, sold our revenues to all sorts of people, removed provinces from the empire of the Roman people, given men kingdoms for bribes, imposed laws on the city by violence, besieged the senate, and, at other times, excluded it from the senate-house by force of arms;--to say nothing, I say, of all this, do you not consider this, that he who has attacked Mutina, a most powerful colony of the Roman people--who has besieged a general of the Roman people, who is consul elect--who has laid waste the lands,--do you not consider, I say, how shameful and iniquitous a thing it would be for that man to be received into this order, by which he has been so repeatedly pronounced an enemy for these very reasons?",
    "I have said enough of the shamefulness of such a proceeding; I will now speak next, as I proposed, of the danger of it; which, although it is not so important to avoid as shame, still offends the minds of the greater part of mankind even more.",
    "VI.",
    "Will it then be possible for you to rely on the certainty of any peace, when you see Antonius, or rather the Antonii, in the city?",
    "Unless, indeed, you despise Lucius: I do not despise even Caius.",
    "But, as I think, Lucius will be the dominant spirit,--for he is the patron of the five-and-thirty tribes, whose votes he took away by his law, by which he divided the magistracies in conjunction with Caius Caesar.",
    "He is the patron of the centuries of the Roman knights, which also he thought fit to deprive of the suffrages: he is the patron of the men who have been military tribunes; he is the patron of the middle of Janus.",
    "O ye gods!",
    "who will be able to support this man's power?",
    "especially when he has brought all his dependants into the lands.",
    "Who ever was the patron of all the tribes?",
    "and of the Roman knights?",
    "and of the military tribunes?",
    "Do you think that the power of even the Gracchi was greater than that of this gladiator will be?",
    "whom I have called gladiator, not in the sense in which sometimes Marcus Antonius too is called gladiator, but as men call him who are speaking plain Latin.",
    "He has fought in Asia as a mirmillo.",
    "After having equipped his own companion and intimate friend in the armour of a Thracian, he slew the miserable man as he was flying; but he himself received a palpable wound, as the scar proves.",
    "What will the man who murdered his friend in this way, when he has an opportunity, do to an enemy?",
    "and if he did such a thing as this for the fun of the thing, what do you think he will do when tempted by the hope of plunder?",
    "Will he not again meet wicked men in the decuries?",
    "will he not again tamper with those men who have received lands?",
    "will he not again seek those who have been banished?",
    "will he not, in short, be Marcus Antonius; to whom, on the occasion of every commotion, there will be a rush of all profligate citizens?",
    "Even if there be no one else except those who are with him now, and these who in this body now openly speak in his favour, will they be too small in number?",
    "especially when all the protection which we might have had from good men is lost, and when those men are prepared to obey his nod?",
    "But I am afraid, if at this time we fail to adopt wise counsels, that that party will in a short time appear too numerous for us.",
    "Nor have I any dislike to peace; only I do dread war disguised under the name of peace.",
    "Wherefore, if we wish to enjoy peace we must first wage war.",
    "If we shrink from war, peace we shall never have.",
    "VII.",
    "But it becomes your prudence, O conscript fathers, to provide as far forward as possible for posterity.",
    "That is the object for which we were placed in this garrison, and as it were on this watch-tower; that by our vigilance and foresight we might keep the Roman people free from fear.",
    "It would be a shameful thing, especially in so clear a case as this, for it to be notorious that wisdom was wanting to the chief council of the whole world.",
    "We have such consuls, there is such eagerness on the part of the Roman people, we have such an unanimous feeling of all Italy in our favour, such generals, and such armies, that the republic cannot possibly suffer any disaster without the senate being in fault.",
    "I, for my part, will not be wanting.",
    "I will warn you, I will forewarn you, I will give you notice, I will call gods and men to witness what I do really believe.",
    "Nor will I display my good faith alone, which perhaps may seem to be enough, but which in a chief citizen is not enough; I will exert all my care, and prudence, and vigilance.",
    "I have spoken about the danger.",
    "I will now proceed to prove to you that it is not possible for peace to be firmly cemented; for of the propositions which I promised to establish this is the last.",
    "VIII.",
    "What peace can there be between Marcus Antonius and (in the first place) the senate?",
    "with what face will he be able to look upon you, and with what eyes will you, in turn, look upon him?",
    "Which of you does not hate him?",
    "which of you does not he hate?",
    "Come, are you the only people who hate him; and whom he hates?",
    "What?",
    "what do you think of those men who are besieging Mutina, who are levying troops in Gaul, who are threatening your fortunes?",
    "will they ever be friends to you, or you to them?",
    "Will he embrace the Roman knights?",
    "For, suppose their inclinations respecting, and their opinions of Antonius were very much concealed, when they stood in crowds on the steps of the temple of Concord, when they stimulated you to endeavour to recover your liberty, when they demanded arms, the robe of war, and war, and who, with the Roman people, invited me to meet in the assembly of the people, will these men ever become friends to Antonius?",
    "will Antonius ever maintain peace with them?",
    "For why should I speak of the whole Roman people?",
    "which, in a full and crowded forum, twice, with one heart and one voice, summoned me into the assembly, and plainly showed their excessive eagerness for the recovery of their liberty.",
    "So, desirable as it was before to have the Roman people for our comrade, we now have it for our leader.",
    "What hope then is there that there ever can be peace between the Roman people and the men who are besieging Mutina and attacking a general and army of the Roman people?",
    "Will there be peace with the municipal towns, whose great zeal is shown by the decrees which they pass, by the soldiers whom they furnish, by the sums which they promise, so that in each town there is such a spirit as leaves no one room to wish for a senate of the Roman people?",
    "The men of Firmium deserve to be praised by a resolution of our order, who set the first example of promising money; we ought to return a complimentary answer to the Marrucini, who have passed a vote that all who evade military service are to be branded with infamy.",
    "These measures are adopted all over Italy.",
    "There is great peace between Antonius and these men, and between them and him!",
    "What greater discord can there possibly be?",
    "And in discord civil peace cannot by any possibility exist.",
    "To say nothing of the mob, look at Lucius Nasidius, a Roman knight, a man of the very highest accomplishments and honour, a citizen always eminent, whose watchfulness and exertions for the protection of my life I felt in my consulship; who not only exhorted his neighbours to become soldiers, but also assisted them from his own resources; will it be possible ever to reconcile Antonius to such a man as this, a man whom we ought to praise by a formal resolution of the senate?",
    "What? will it be possible to reconcile him to Caius Caesar, who prevented him from entering the city, or to Decimus Brutus, who has refused him entrance into Gaul?",
    "Moreover, will he reconcile himself to, or look mercifully on the province of Gaul, by which he has been excluded and rejected?",
    "You will see everything, O conscript fathers, if you do not take care, full of hatred and full of discord, from which civil wars arise.",
    "Do not then desire that which is impossible: and beware, I entreat you by the immortal gods, O conscript fathers, that out of hope of present peace you do not lose perpetual peace.",
    "What now is the object of this oration?",
    "For we do not yet know what the ambassadors have done.",
    "But still we ought to be awake, erect, prepared, armed in our minds, so as not to be deceived by any civil or supplicatory language, or by any pretence of justice.",
    "He must have complied with all the prohibitions and all the commands which we have sent him, before he can demand anything.",
    "He must have desisted from attacking Brutus and his army, and from plundering the cities and lands of the province of Gaul; he must have permitted the ambassadors to go to Brutus, and led his army back on this side of the Rubicon, and yet not come within two hundred miles of this city.",
    "He must have submitted himself to the power of the senate and of the Roman people.",
    "If he does this, then we shall have an opportunity of deliberating without any decision being forced upon us either way.",
    "If he does not obey the senate, then it will not be the senate that declares war against him, but he who will have declared it against the senate.",
    "But I warn you, O conscript fathers, the liberty of the Roman people, which is entrusted to you, is at stake.",
    "The life and fortune of every virtuous man is at stake, against which Antonius has long been directing his insatiable covetousness, united to his savage cruelty.",
    "Your authority is at stake, which you will wholly lose if you do not maintain it now.",
    "Beware how you let that foul and deadly beast escape now that you have got him confined and chained.",
    "You too, Pansa, I warn, (although you do not need counsel, for you have plenty of wisdom yourself: but still, even the most skilful pilots receive often warnings from the passengers in terrible storms,) not to allow this vast and noble preparation which you have made to fall away to nothing.",
    "You have such an opportunity as no one ever had.",
    "It is in your power so to avail yourself of this wise firmness of the senate, of this zeal of the equestrian order, of this ardour of the Roman people, as to release the Roman people from fear and danger for ever.",
    "As to the matters to which your motion before the senate refers, I agree with Publius Servilius.",

    "THE ARGUMENT",
    "After the embassy to Antonius had left Rome the consuls zealously exerted themselves in preparing for war, in case he should reject the demands of the ambassador.",
    "Hirtius, though in bad health, left Rome first, at the head of an army containing, among others, the Martial and the fourth legions, intending to join Octavius and hoping with his assistance to prevent his gaining any advantage over Brutus till Pansa could join them.",
    "And he gained some advantages over Antonius at once.",
    "About the beginning of February the two remaining ambassadors (for Servius Sulpicius had died just as they arrived at Antonius's camp) returned, bringing word that Antonius would comply with none of the commands of the senate, nor allow them to proceed to Decimus Brutus, and bringing also (contrary to their duty) demands from him, of which the principal were, that his troops were to be rewarded, all the acts of himself and Dolabella to be ratified as also all that he had done respecting Caesar's papers, that no account was to be required of him of the money; in the temple of Ops and that he should have the further Gaul with an army of six legions.",
    "Pansa summoned the senate to receive the report of the ambassador, when Cicero made a severe speech, proposing very vigorous measures against Antonius, which, however, Galenus and his party were still numerous enough to mitigate very greatly; and even Pansa voted against him and in favour of the milder measures though they could not prevail against Cicero to have a second embassy sent to Antonius, and though Cicero carried his point of ordering the citizens to assume the _sagum_, or robe of war which he also (waving his privilege as a man of consular rank) wore himself.",
    "The next day the senate met again, to draw upon form the decrees on which they had resolved the day before, when Cicero addressed the following speech to them, expostulating with them for their wavering the day before.",
    "I. Matters were carried on yesterday, O Caius Pansa, in a more irregular manner than the beginning of your consulship required.",
    "You did not appear to me to make sufficient resistance to those men, to whom you are not in the habit of yielding.",
    "For while the virtue of the senate was such as it usually is, and while all men saw that there was war in reality, and some thought that the name ought to be kept back, on the division, your inclination inclined to lenity.",
    "The course which we proposed therefore was defeated, at your instigation, on account of the harshness of the word war.",
    "That urged by Lucius Caesar, a most honourable man, prevailed, which, taking away that one harsh expression, was gentler in its language than in its real intention.",
    "Although he, indeed, before he delivered his opinion at all, pleaded his relationship to Antonius in excuse for it.",
    "He had done the same in my consulship, in respect of his sister's husband, as he did now in respect of his sister's son, so that he was moved by the grief of his sister, and at the same time he wished to provide for the safety of the republic.",
    "And yet Caesar himself in some degree recommended you, O conscript fathers, not to agree with him, when he said that he should have expressed quite different sentiments, worthy both of himself and of the republic, if he had not been hampered by his relationship to Antonius.",
    "He, then, is his uncle, are you his uncles too, you who voted with him?",
    "But on what did the dispute turn?",
    "Some men, in delivering their opinion, did not choose to insert the word \"war\".",
    "They preferred calling it \"tumult,\" being ignorant not only of the state of affairs, but also of the meaning of words.",
    "For there can be a \"war\" without a \"tumult,\" but there cannot be a \"tumult\" without a \"war.\"",
    "For what is a \"tumult,\" but such a violent disturbance that an unusual alarm is engendered by it? from which indeed the name \"tumult\"[39] is derived.",
    "Therefore, our ancestors spoke of the Italian \"tumult,\" which was a domestic one, of the Gallic \"tumult,\" which was on the frontier of Italy, but they never spoke of any other.",
    "And that a \"tumult\" is a more serious thing than a \"war\" may be seen from this, that during a war exemptions from military service are valid, but in a tumult they are not.",
    "So that it is the fact, as I have said, that war can exist without a tumult, but a tumult cannot exist without a war.",
    "In truth, as there is no medium between war and peace, it is quite plain that a tumult, if it be not a sort of war, must be a sort of peace; and what more absurd can be said or imagined?",
    "However, we have said too much about a word; let us rather look to the facts, O conscript fathers, the appreciation of which, I know, is at times injured by too much attention being paid to words.",
    "II.",
    "We are unwilling that this should appear to be a war.",
    "What is the object, then, of our giving authority to the municipal towns and colonies to exclude Antonius? of our authorizing soldiers to be enlisted without any force, without the terror of any fine, of their own inclination and eagerness?",
    "of permitting them to promise money for the assistance of the republic?",
    "For if the name of war be taken away, the zeal of the municipal towns will be taken away too.",
    "And the unanimous feeling of the Roman people which at present pours itself into our cause, if we cool upon it, must inevitably be damped.",
    "But why need I say more?",
    "Decimus Brutus is attacked.",
    "Is not that war?",
    "Mutina is besieged.",
    "Is not even that war?",
    "Gaul is laid waste.",
    "What peace can be more assured than this?",
    "Who can think of calling that war?",
    "We have sent forth a consul, a most gallant man, with an army, who, though he was in a weak state from a long and serious illness, still thought he ought not to make any excuse when he was summoned to the protection of the republic.",
    "Caius Caesar, indeed, did not wait for our decrees; especially as that conduct of his was not unsuited to his age.",
    "He undertook war against Antonius of his own accord; for there was not yet time to pass a decree; and he saw that, if he let slip the opportunity of waging war, when the republic was crushed it would be impossible to pass any decrees at all.",
    "They and their arms, then, are now at peace.",
    "He is not an enemy whose garrison Hirtius has driven from Claterna; he is not an enemy who is in arms resisting a consul, and attacking a consul elect; and those are not the words of an enemy, nor is that warlike language, which Pansa read just now out of his colleague's letters: \"I drove out the garrison.\"",
    "\"I got possession of Claterna.\"",
    "\"The cavalry were routed.\"",
    "\"A battle was fought.\"",
    "\"A good many men were slain.\"",
    "What peace can be greater than this?",
    "Levies of troops are ordered throughout all Italy; all exemptions from service are suspended; the robe of war is to be assumed to-morrow, the consul has said that he shall come down to the senate house with an armed guard.",
    "Is not this war?",
    "Ay, it is such a war as has never been.",
    "For in all other wars, and most especially in civil wars, it was a difference as to the political state of the republic which gave rise to the contest.",
    "Sylla contended against Sulpicius about the force of laws which Sylla said had been passed by violence.",
    "Cinna warred against Octavius because of the votes of the new citizens.",
    "Again, Sylla was at variance with Cinna and Marius, in order to prevent unworthy men from attaining power, and to avenge the cruel death of most illustrious men.",
    "The causes of all these wars arose from the zeal of different parties, for what they considered the interest of the republic.",
    "Of the last civil war I cannot bear to speak.",
    "I do not understand the cause of it, I detest the result.",
    "III.",
    "This is the fifth civil war, (and all of them have fallen upon our times,) the first which has not only not brought dissensions and discord among the citizens, but which has been signalised by extraordinary unanimity and incredible concord.",
    "All of them have the same wish, all defend the same objects, all are inspired with the same sentiments.",
    "When I say all, I except those whom no one thinks worthy of being citizens at all.",
    "What, then, is the cause of war, and what is the object aimed at?",
    "We are defending the temples of the immortal gods, we are defending the walls of the city, we are defending the homes and habitations of the Roman people, the household gods, the altars, the hearths and the sepulchres of our forefathers, we are defending our laws, our courts of justice, our freedom, our wives, our children, and our country.",
    "On the other hand, Marcus Antonius labours and fights in order to throw into confusion and overturn all these things, and hopes to have reason to think the plunder of the republic sufficient cause for the war, while he squanders part of our fortunes, and distributes the rest among his parricidal followers.",
    "While, then, the motives for war are so different, a most miserable circumstance is what that fellow promises to his band of robbers.",
    "In the first place our houses, for he declares that he will divide the city among them, and after that he will lead them out at whatever gate and settle them on whatever lands they please.",
    "All the Caphons,[40] all the Saxas, and the other plagues which attend Antonius, are marking out for themselves in their own minds most beautiful houses, and gardens, and villas, at Tusculum and Alba; and those clownish men--if indeed they are men, and not rather brute beasts--are borne on in their empty hopes as far as the waters and Puteoli.",
    "So Antonius has something to promise to his followers.",
    "What can we do?",
    "Have we anything of the sort?",
    "May the gods grant us a better fate!",
    "for our express object is to prevent any one at all from hereafter making similar promises.",
    "I say this against my will, still I must say it;--the auction sanctioned by Caesar, O conscript fathers, gives many wicked men both hope and audacity.",
    "For they saw some men become suddenly rich from having been beggars.",
    "Therefore, those men who are hanging over our property, and to whom Antonius promises everything, are always longing to see an auction.",
    "What can we do?",
    "What do we promise our soldiers?",
    "Things much better and more honourable.",
    "For promises to be earned by wicked actions are pernicious both to those who expect them, and to those who promise them.",
    "We promise to our soldiers freedom, rights, laws, justice, the empire of the world, dignity, peace, tranquillity.",
    "The promises then of Antonius are bloody, polluted, wicked, odious to gods and men, neither lasting nor salutary; ours, on the other hand, are honourable, upright, glorious, full of happiness, and full of piety.",
    "IV.",
    "Here also Quintus Fufius, a brave and energetic man, and a friend of mine, reminds me of the advantages of peace.",
    "As if, if it were necessary to praise peace, I could not do it myself quite as well as he.",
    "For is it once only that I have defended peace?",
