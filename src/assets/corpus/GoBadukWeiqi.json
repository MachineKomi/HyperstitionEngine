    "Accelerating Self-Play Learning in Go David J. Wu∗ Jane Street Group November 10, 2020",
    "Abstract By introducing several improvements to the AlphaZero process and architecture, we greatly accelerate self-play learning in Go, achieving a 50x reduction in computation over comparable methods.",
    "LikeAlphaZeroandreplicationssuchasELFOpenGoandLeelaZero,ourbotKataGo only learns from neural-net-guided Monte Carlo tree search self-play.",
    "But whereas AlphaZero required thousands of TPUs over several days and ELF required thousands of GPUs over two weeks, KataGo surpasses ELF’s final model after only 19 days on fewer than 30 GPUs.",
    "Much of the speedup involves non-domain-specific improvements that might directly transfer to other problems.",
    "Further gains from domain-specific techniques reveal the remaining efficiency gap between the best methods and purely general methods such as AlphaZero.",
    "Our work is a step towardsmakinglearninginstatespacesaslargeasGopossiblewithoutlarge-scalecomputational resources.",
    "1 Introduction In2017,DeepMind’sAlphaGoZerodemonstratedthatitwaspossibletoachievesuperhumanperfor- manceinGowithoutrelianceonhumanstrategicknowledgeorpreexistingdata[18].",
    "Subsequently, DeepMind’s AlphaZero achieved comparable results in Chess and Shogi.",
    "However, the amount of computation required was large, with DeepMind’s main reported run for Go using 5000 TPUs for several days, totaling about 41 TPU-years",
    "[17].",
    "Similarly ELF OpenGo, a replication by Face- book, used 2000 V100 GPUs for about 13-14 days1, or about 74 GPU-years, to reach top levels of performance [19].",
    "In this paper, we introduce several new techniques to improve the efficiency of self-play learning, while also reviving some pre-AlphaZero ideas in computer Go and newly applying them to the Alp- haZero process.",
    "Although our bot KataGo uses some domain-specific features and optimizations, it still starts from random play and makes no use of outside strategic knowledge or preexisting data.",
    "It surpasses the strength of ELF OpenGo",
    "after training on about 27 V100 GPUs for 19 days, a total of about 1.4 GPU-years, or about a factor of 50 reduction.",
    "And by a conservative comparison, ∗email:lightvector@gmail.com.",
    "Many thanks to Craig Falls, David Parkes, James Somers, and numerous others for their kind feedback and advice on this work.",
    "1Although ELF’s training run lasted about 16 days, its final model was chosen from a point slightly prior to the end of the run.",
    "1 0202 voN 9 ]GL.sc[ 5v56501.2091:viXra KataGo is also at least an order of magnitude more efficient than the multi-year-long online dis- tributed training project Leela Zero",
    "[14].",
    "Our code is open-source, and superhuman trained models and data from our main run are available online2.",
    "We make two main contributions:",
    "First, we present a variety of domain-independent improvements that might directly transfer to other AlphaZero-like learning or to reinforcement learning more generally.",
    "These include: (1) a new technique of playout cap randomization to improve the balance of data for different targets in the AlphaZero process, (2) a new technique of policy target pruning that improves policy training by decoupling it from exploration in MCTS, (3) the addition of a global-pooling mechanism to the neural net, agreeing with research elsewhere on global context in image tasks such as by Hu et al. (2018)",
    "[8], and (4) a revived idea from supervised learning in Go to add auxiliary policy targets from future actions tried by Tian and Zhu (2016)",
    "[20], which we find transfers easily to self-play and could apply widely to other problems in reinforcement learning.",
    "Second, our work serves as a case study that there is still a significant efficiency gap between AlphaZero’s methods and what is possible from self-play.",
    "We find nontrivial further gains from some domain-specific methods.",
    "These include auxiliary ownership and score targets (similar to those in Wu et al. 2018",
    "[22])",
    "and which actually also suggest a much more general meta-learning heuristic: that predicting subcomponents of desired targets can greatly improve training.",
    "We also find that adding some game-specific input features still significantly improves learning, indicating that though AlphaZero succeeds without them, it is also far from obsoleting them.",
    "In Section 2 we summarize our architecture.",
    "In Sections 3 and 4 we outline the general techniques of playout cap randomization, policy target pruning, global-pooling, and auxiliary policy targets, followedbydomain-specificimprovementsincludingownership and score targets andinputfeatures.",
    "In Section 5 we present our data, including comparison runs showing how these techniques each improve learning and all similarly contribute to the final result.",
    "2 Basic Architecture and Parameters",
    "Although varying in many minor details, KataGo’s overall architecture resembles the AlphaGoZero and AlphaZero architectures [18, 17].",
    "KataGo plays games against itself using Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by a neural net to generate training data.",
    "Search consists of growing a game tree by repeated playouts.",
    "Playouts start from the root and descend the tree, at each node n choosing the child c that maximizes: (cid:112)(cid:80) N(c(cid:48)) PUCT(c) = V(c)+c P(c) c(cid:48)",
    "PUCT 1+N(c) where V(c) is the average predicted utility of all nodes in c’s subtree, P(c) is the policy prior of c from the neural net, N(c) is the number of playouts previously sent through child c, and c = 1.1.",
    "Upon reaching the end of the tree and finding that the next chosen child is not PUCT 2https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo.",
    "Using our code, it is possible to reach strong or top human amateur strength starting from nothing on even single GPUs in mere days, and several people have in fact already done so.",
    "2 allocated, the playout terminates by appending that single child to the tree.3 Like AlphaZero, to aid discovery of unexpected moves, KataGo adds noise to the policy prior at the root: P(c) = 0.75P (c)+0.25η raw where η is a draw from a Dirichlet distribution on legal moves with parameter α = 0.03∗192/N(c) where N is the total number of legal moves.",
    "This matches AlphaZero’s α = 0.03 on the empty 19 × 19 Go board while scaling to other sizes.",
    "KataGo also applies a softmax temperature at the root of 1.03, an idea to improve policy convergence stability from SAI, another AlphaGoZero replication [13] .",
    "The neural net guiding search is a convolutional residual net with a preactivation architecture",
    "[7], with a trunk of b residual blocks with c channels.",
    "Similar to Leela Zero",
    "[14], KataGo began with small nets and progressively increased their size, concurrently training the next larger size on the same data and switching when its average loss caught up to the smaller size.",
    "In KataGo’s main 19-dayrun, (b,c)beganat(6,96)andswitchedto(10,128), (15,192), and(20,256), atroughly0.75 days, 1.75 days, and 7.5 days, respectively.",
    "The final size matches that of AlphaZero and ELF.",
    "The neural net has several output heads.",
    "Sampling positions from the self-play games, a policy head predicts probable good moves while a game outcome value head predicts if the game was ultimately won or lost.",
    "The loss function is: (cid:88) (cid:88)",
    "L = −c z(r)log(zˆ(r))− π(m)log(πˆ(m))+c ||θ||2 g L2 r m where r ∈ {win,loss} is the outcome for the current player, z is a one-hot encoding of it, zˆ is the neural net’s prediction of z, m ranges over the set of possible moves, π is a target policy distribution derived from the playouts of the MCTS search, πˆ is the prediction of π, c = 3e-5 sets L2 an L2 penalty on the model parameters θ, and c = 1.5 is a scaling constant.",
    "As described in later g sections, we also add additional terms corresponding to other heads that predict auxiliary targets.",
    "Training uses stochastic gradient descent with a momentum decay of 0.9 and a batch size of 256 (the largest size fitting on one GPU).",
    "It uses a fixed per-sample learning rate of 6e-5, except that the first 5 million samples (merely a few percent of the total steps) use a rate of 2e-5 to reduce instability from early large gradients.",
    "In KataGo’s main run, the per-sample learning rate was also dropped to 6e-6 starting at about 17.5 days to maximize final strength.",
    "Samples are drawn uniformly from a growing moving window of the most recent data, with window size beginning at 250,000 samples and increasing to about 22 million by the end of the main run.",
    "See Appendix C for details.",
    "Trainingusesaversionofstochastic weight averaging [9].",
    "Everyroughly250,000trainingsamples,a snapshot of the weights is saved, and every four snapshots, a new candidate neural net is produced by taking an exponential moving average of snapshots with decay = 0.75 (averaging four snapshots of lookback).",
    "Candidate nets must pass a gating test by winning at least 100 out of 200 test games against the current net to become the new net for self-play.",
    "See Appendix E for details.",
    "In total, KataGo’s main run lasted for 19 days using a maximum of 28 V100 GPUs at any time (averaging 26-27) and generated about 241 million training samples across 4.2 million games.",
    "Self- 3When N(c) = 0 and V(c) is undefined, unlike AlphaZero but like Leela Zero, we define: V(c) = V(n) − c (cid:112) P where P = (cid:80) P(c(cid:48)) is the total policy of explored children and c = 0.2 is a FPU explored explored c(cid:48)|N(c(cid:48))>0 FPU “first-play-urgency” reduction coefficient, except c =0 at the root if Dirichlet noise is enabled.",
    "FPU 3 playgamesusedTromp-Taylorrules[21]modifiedtonotrequirecapturingstoneswithinpass-alive- territory4.",
    "“Ko”, “suicide”, and “komi” rules also varied from Tromp-Taylor randomly, and some proportion of games were randomly played on smaller boards5.",
    "See Appendix D for other details.",
    "3 Major General Improvements 3.1 Playout Cap Randomization One of the major improvements in KataGo’s training process over AlphaZero is to randomly vary the number of playouts on different turns to relieve a major tension between policy and value training.",
    "In the AlphaZero process, the game outcome value target is highly data-limited, with only one noisy binary result per entire game.",
    "Holding compute fixed, it would likely be beneficial for value training to use only a small number of playouts per turn to generate more games, even if those games are of slightly lower quality.",
    "For example, in the first version of AlphaGo, self-play using only a single playout per turn (i.e., directly using the policy) was still of sufficient quality to train a decent value net [16].",
    "However, informal prior research by Forsten (2019)",
    "[6] has suggested that at least in Go, ideal numbers of playouts for policy learning are much larger, not far from AlphaZero’s choice of 800 playouts per move [17].",
    "Although the policy gets many samples per game, unless the number of playouts is larger than ideal for value training, the search usually does not deviate much from the policy prior, so the policy does not readily improve.",
    "We introduce playout cap randomization to mitigate this tension.",
    "On a small proportion p of turns, we perform a full search, stopping when the tree reaches a cap of N nodes, and for all other turns we perform a fast search with a much smaller cap of n < N. Only turns with a full search are recorded for training.",
    "For fast searches, we also disable Dirichlet noise and other explorative settings, maximizing strength.",
    "For KataGo’s main 19-day run, we chose p = 0.25 and (N,n) = (600,100) initially, annealing up to (1000,200) after the first two days of training.",
    "Because most moves use a fast search, more games are played, improving value training.",
    "But since n is small, fast searches cost only a limited fraction of the computation time, so the drop in the numberofgoodpolicysamplespercomputationtimeisnotlarge.",
    "Theablationstudiespresentedin section 5.2 indicate that playout cap randomization indeed outperforms a variety of fixed numbers of playouts.",
    "3.2 Forced Playouts and Policy Target Pruning Like AlphaZero and other implementations such as ELF and Leela Zero, KataGo uses the final root playout distribution from MCTS to produce the policy target for training.",
    "However, KataGo does 4InGo,aversionofBenson’salgorithm[1]canproveareassafeevengivenunboundedlymanyconsecutiveopponent moves (“pass-alive”), enabling this minor optimization.",
    "5Almost all major AlphaZero reproductions in Go have been hardcoded to fixed board sizes and rules.",
    "Although not the focus of this paper, KataGo’s randomization allows training a single model that generalizes across all these variations.",
    "4 not use the raw distribution.",
    "Instead, we introduce policy target pruning, a new method which enables improved exploration via forced playouts.",
    "We observed in informal tests that even if a Dirichlet noise move was good, its initial evaluation might be negative, preventing further search and leaving the move undiscovered.",
    "Therefore, for each child c of the root that has received any playouts, we ensure it receives a minimum number of forced playouts based on the noised policy and the total sum of playouts so far: (cid:32) (cid:33)1/2 (cid:88) n (c) = kP(c) N(c(cid:48)) forced c(cid:48)",
    "We do this by setting the MCTS selection urgency PUCT(c) to infinity whenever a child of the root has fewer than this many playouts.",
    "The exponent of 1/2 < 1 ensures that forced playouts scale with search but asymptotically decay to a zero proportion for bad moves, and k = 2 is large enough to actually force a small percent of playouts in practice.",
    "However, the vast majority of the time, noise moves are bad moves, and in AlphaZero since the policy target is the playout distribution, we would train the policy to predict these extra bad playouts.",
    "Therefore, we perform a policy target pruning step.",
    "In particular, we identify the child c∗ with the most playouts, and then from each other child c, we subtract up to n playouts so forced long as it does not cause PUCT(c) >= PUCT(c∗), holding constant the final utility estimate for both.",
    "This subtracts all “extra” playouts that normal PUCT would not have chosen on its own, unless a move was found to be good.",
    "Additionally, we outright prune children that are reduced to a single playout.",
    "See Figure 1 for a visualization of the effect on the learned policy.",
    "Figure 1: Log policy of 10-block nets, white to play.",
    "Left: trained with forced playouts and policy targetpruning.",
    "Right: trainedwithout.",
    "Dark/redthroughbrightgreenrangesfromaboutp = 2e-4 to p = 1.",
    "Pruning reduces the policy mass on many bad moves near the edges.",
    "The critical feature of such pruning is that it allows decoupling the policy target in AlphaZero from the dynamics of MCTS or the use of explorative noise.",
    "There is no reason to expect the optimal level of playout dispersion in MCTS to also be optimal for the policy target and the long-term convergence of the neural net.",
    "Our use of policy target pruning with forced playouts, though an improvement, is only a simple application of this method.",
    "We are eager to explore others in the 5 future, including alterations to the PUCT formula itself6.",
    "3.3",
    "Global Pooling Another improvement in KataGo over earlier work is from adding global pooling layers at various points in the neural network.",
    "This enables the convolutional layers to condition on global context, which would be hard or impossible with the limited perceptual radius of convolution alone.",
    "In KataGo, given a set of c channels, a global pooling layer computes (1) the mean of each channel, (2) the mean of each channel scaled linearly with the width of the board, and (3) the maximum of each channel.",
    "This produces a total of 3c output values.",
    "These layers are used in a global pooling bias structure consisting of: • Input tensors X (shape b×b×c ) and G (shape b×b×c ).",
    "X G • A batch normalization layer and ReLu activation applied to G (output shape b×b×c ).",
    "G •",
    "A global pooling layer (output shape 3c ).",
    "G •",
    "A fully connected layer to c outputs (output shape c ).",
    "X X • Channelwise addition with X (output shape b×b×c ).",
    "X Figure 2: Global pooling bias structure, globally aggregating values of one set of channels to bias another set of channels.",
    "See Figure 2 for a diagram.",
    "This structure follows the first convolution layer of two to three of the residual blocks in KataGo’s neural nets, and the first convolution layer in the policy head.",
    "It is also used in the value head with a slight further modification.",
    "See Appendix A for details.",
    "In Section 5.2 our experiments show that this greatly improves the later stages of training.",
    "As Go contains explicit nonlocal tactics (“ko”), this is not surprising.",
    "But global context should help even in domains without explicit nonlocal interactions.",
    "For example, in a wide variety of strategy games, strong players, when winning, alter their local move preferences to favor “simple” √ 6The PUCT formula V(c)+c P(c) (cid:80) c(cid:48)N(c(cid:48)) has the property that if V is constant, then playouts will be PUCT 1+N(c) roughly proportional to P. Informal tests suggest this is important to the convergence of P, and without something like target pruning, alternate formulas can disrupt training even when improving match strength.",
    "6 options, whereas when losing they seek “complication”.",
    "Global pooling allows convolutional nets to internally condition on such global context.",
    "The general idea of using global context is by no means novel to our work.",
    "For example, Hu et al. (2018) have introduced a “Squeeze-and-Excitation” architecture to achieve new results in image classification [8].",
    "Although their implementation is different, the fundamental concept is the same.",
    "And though not formally published, Squeeze-Excite-like architectures are now in use in some online AlphaZero-relatedprojects[10,11], andwelookforwardtoexploringitourselvesinfutureresearch.",
    "3.4 Auxiliary Policy Targets As another generalizable improvement over AlphaZero, we add an auxiliary policy target that pre- dicts the opponent’s reply on the following turn to improve regularization.",
    "This idea is not entirely new, having been found by Tian and Zhu in Facebook’s bot Darkforest to improve supervised move prediction [20], but as far as we know, KataGo is the first to apply it to the AlphaZero process.",
    "We simply have the policy head output a new channel predicting this target, adding a term to the loss function: (cid:88)",
    "−w π (m)log(πˆ (m))",
    "opp opp opp m∈moves where π is the policy target that will be recorded for the turn after the current turn, πˆ is the opp opp neural net’s prediction of π , and w = 0.15 weights this target only a fraction as much as the opp opp actual policy, since it is for regularization only and is never actually used for play.",
    "WefindinSection5.2thatthisproducesamodestbutclearbenefit.",
    "Moreover,thisideacouldapply to a wide range of reinforcement-learning tasks.",
    "Even in single-agent situations, one could predict one’s own future actions, or predict the environment (treating the environment as an “agent”).",
    "Along with Section 4.1, it shows how enriching the training data with additional targets is valuable when data is limited or expensive.",
    "We believe it deserves attention as a simple and nearly costless method to regularize the AlphaZero process or other broader learning algorithms.",
    "4 Major Domain-Specific Improvements 4.1 Auxiliary Ownership and Score Targets One of the major improvements in KataGo’s training process over AlphaZero comes from adding auxiliary ownership and score prediction targets.",
    "Similar targets were earlier explored in work by Wu et al. (2018)",
    "[22] in supervised learning, where the authors found improved mean squared error on human game result prediction and mildly improved the strength of their overall bot, CGI.",
    "To our knowledge, KataGo is the first to publicly apply such ideas to the reinforcement-learning- like context of self-play training in Go7.",
    "While the targets themselves are game-specific, they also highlight a more general heuristic underemphasized in transfer- and multi-task-learning literature.",
    "7Abot“Golaxy”developedbyaChineseresearchgroupappearsalsocapableofmakingscorepredictions,butwe are not currently aware of anywhere they have published their methods.",
    "7",
    "As observed earlier, in AlphaZero, learning is highly constrained by data and noise on the game outcome prediction.",
    "But although the game outcome is noisy and binary, it is a direct function of finer variables: the final score difference and the ownership of each board location8.",
    "Decomposing thegameresultintothesefinervariablesandpredictingthemaswellshouldimproveregularization.",
    "Therefore, we add these outputs and three additional terms to the loss function: • Ownership loss: (cid:88) (cid:88) −w o(l,p)log(oˆ(l,p))",
    "o l∈boardp∈players where o(l,p) ∈ {0,0.5,1} indicates if l is finally owned by p, or is shared, oˆ is the prediction of o, and w = 1.5/b2 where b ∈ [9,19] is the board width.",
    "o • Score belief loss (“pdf”): (cid:88) −w p (x)log(pˆ (x)) spdf s s x∈possiblescores where p is a one-hot encoding of the final score difference, pˆ is the prediction of p , and s s s w = 0.02. spdf • Score belief loss (“cdf”): (cid:32) (cid:33)2 (cid:88) (cid:88)",
    "w p (y)−pˆ (y) scdf s s x∈possiblescores y<x where w = 0.02.",
    "While the “pdf” loss rewards guessing the score exactly, this “cdf” loss scdf pushes the overall mass to be near the final score.",
    "We show in our ablation runs in Section 5.2 that these auxiliary targets noticeably improve the efficiency of learning.",
    "This holds even up through the ends of those runs (though shorter, the runs still reach a strength similar to human-professional), well beyond where the neural net must have already developed a sophisticated judgment of the board.",
    "It might be surprising that these targets would continue to help beyond the earliest stages.",
    "We offer an intuition: consider the task of updating from a game primarily lost due to misjudging a particular region of the board.",
    "With only a final binary result, the neural net can only “guess” at what aspect of the board position caused the loss.",
    "By contrast, with an ownership target, the neural net receives direct feedback on which area of the board was mispredicted, with large errors and gradients localized to the mispredicted area.",
    "The neural net should therefore require fewer samples to perform the correct credit assignment and update correctly.",
    "As with auxiliary policy targets, these results are consistent with work in transfer and multi-task learningshowingthataddingtargetsortaskscanimproveperformance.",
    "Buttheliteratureisscarcer in theory on when additional targets may help – see Zhang and Yang (2017)",
    "[23] for discussion as well as Bingel and Søgaard (2017)",

    "heuristic: whenever a desired target can be expressed as a sum, conjunction, or disjunction of separate subevents, or would be highly correlated with such subevents, predicting those subevents is likely to help.",
    "This is because such a relation should allow for a specific mechanism: that gradients from a mispredicted sub-event will provide sharper, more localized feedback than from the overall event, improving credit assignment.",
    "We are likely not the first to discover such a heuristic.",
    "And of course, it may not always be applicable.",
    "But we feel it is worth highlighting both for practical use and as an avenue for further research, because when applicable, it is a potential path to study and improve the reliability of multi-task-learning approaches for more general problems.",
    "4.2 Game-specific Features In addition to raw features indicating the stones on the board, the history, and the rules and komi in effect, KataGo includes a few game-specific higher-level features in the input to its neural net, similartothoseinearlierwork[4,3,12].",
    "Thesefeaturesareliberties,komiparity,pass-aliveregions, and features indicating ladders (a particular kind of capture tactic).",
    "See Appendix A for details.",
    "Additionally, KataGo uses two minor Go-specific optimizations, where after a certain number of consecutive passes, moves in pass-alive territory are prohibited, and where a tiny bias is added to favor passing when passing and continuing play would lead to identical scores.",
    "Both optimizations slightly speed up the end of the game.",

    "Final Elo ratings were based on the final set of about 21000 games.",
    "To compare the efficiency of training, we computed a crude indicative metric of total self-play com- putation by modeling a neural net with b blocks and c channels as having cost ∼ bc2 per query11.",
    "For KataGo we just counted self-play queries for each size and multiplied.",
    "For ELF, we approxi- mated queries by sampling the average game length from its public training data and multiplied by ELF’s 1600 playouts per move, discounting by 20% to roughly account for transposition caching.",
    "For Leela Zero we estimated it similarly, also interpolating costs where data was missing12.",
    "Leela Zero also generated data using ELF’s prototype networks, but we did not attempt to estimate this cost13.",

    "The following is a detailed breakdown of KataGo’s neural net inputs and architecture.",
    "The neural net has two input tensors, which feed into a trunk of residual blocks.",
    "Attached to the end of the trunk are a policy head and a value head, each with several outputs and subcomponents.",
    "A.1 Inputs",
    "The input to the neural net consists of two tensors, a b×b×18 tensor of 18 binary features for each board location where where b ∈ [b ,b ]",
    "= [9,19] is the width of the board, and a vector min max with 10 real values indicating overall properties of the game state.",
    "These features are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 # Channels Feature 1 Location is on board 2 Location has {own,opponent} stone 3 Location has stone with {1,2,3} liberties 1 Moving here illegal due to ko/superko 5 The last 5 move locations, one-hot 3 Ladderable stones {0,1,2} turns ago 1",
    "Moving here catches opponent in ladder 2 Pass-alive area for {self,opponent} Table 3: Binary spatial-varying input features to the neural net.",

    "This produces a total of 3c output values.",
    "The multi- avg min max plication in (2) allows training weights that work across multiple board sizes, and the subtraction of b and scaling by 1/10 improve orthogonality and ensure values remain near unit scale.",
    "In avg the value head, (3) is replaced with the mean of each channel multiplied by 1 ((b−b )2 −σ2) 100 avg where σ2 = 1 (cid:80)19 (b(cid:48)−b )2.",
    "This is since the value head computes values like score difference 11",
    "b(cid:48)=9 avg that need to scale quadratically with board width.",
    "As before, subtracting σ2 and scaling improves orthogonality and normality.",
