    "By Invitation | Artificial intelligence Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI has hacked the operating system of human civilisation Storytelling computers will change the course of human history, says the historian and philosopher Apr 28th 2023 Fears of artificial intelligence (ai) have haunted humanity since the very beginning of the computer age.",
    "Hitherto these fears focused on machines using physical means to kill, enslave or replace people.",
    "But over the past couple of years new ai tools have emerged that threaten the survival of human civilisation from an unexpected direction.",
    "ai has gained some remarkable abilities to manipulate and generate language, whether with words, sounds or images.",
    "ai has thereby hacked the operating system of our civilisation.",
    "Language is the stuff almost all human culture is made of.",
    "Human rights, for example, aren’t inscribed in our dna.",
    "Rather, they are cultural artefacts we created by telling stories and writing laws.",
    "Gods aren’t physical realities.",
    "Rather, they are cultural artefacts we created by inventing myths and writing scriptures.",
    "Money, too, is a cultural artefact.",
    "Banknotes are just colourful pieces of paper, and at present more than 90% of money is not even banknotes—it is just digital information in computers.",
    "What gives money value is the stories that bankers, finance ministers and cryptocurrency gurus tell us about it.",
    "Sam Bankman-Fried, Elizabeth Holmes and Bernie Madoff were not particularly good at creating real value, but they were all extremely capable storytellers.",
    "What would happen once a non-human intelligence becomes better than the average human at telling stories, composing melodies, drawing images, and writing laws and scriptures?",
    "When people think about Chatgpt and other new ai tools, they are often drawn to examples like school children using ai to write their essays.",
    "What will happen to the school system when kids do that?",
    "But this kind of question misses the big picture.",
    "Forget about school essays.",
    "Think of the next American presidential race in 2024, and try to imagine the impact of ai tools that can be made to mass-produce political content, fake-news stories and scriptures for new cults.",
    "In recent years the qAnon cult has coalesced around anonymous online messages, known as “q drops”.",
    "Followers collected, revered and interpreted these q drops as a sacred text.",
    "While to the best of our knowledge all previous q drops were composed by humans, and bots merely helped disseminate them, in future we might see the first cults in history whose revered texts were written by a non-human intelligence.",
    "Religions throughout history have claimed a non- human source for their holy books.",
    "Soon that might be a reality.",
    "On a more prosaic level, we might soon find ourselves conducting lengthy online discussions about abortion, climate change or the Russian invasion of Ukraine with entities that we think are humans—but are actually ai.",
    "The catch is that it is utterly pointless for us to spend time trying to change the declared opinions of an ai bot, while the ai could hone its messages so precisely that it stands a good chance of influencing us.",
    "Read more: • How to worry wisely about artificial intelligence •",
    "How AI could change computing, culture and the course of history •",
    "How generative models could go wrong •",
    "Yuval Noah Harari argues that what’s at stake in Ukraine is the direction of human history Through its mastery of language, ai could even form intimate relationships with people, and use the power of intimacy to change our opinions and worldviews.",
    "Although there is no indication that ai has any consciousness or feelings of its own, to foster fake intimacy with humans it is enough if the ai can make them feel emotionally attached to it.",
    "In June 2022 Blake Lemoine, a Google engineer, publicly claimed that the ai chatbot Lamda, on which he was working, had become sentient.",
    "The controversial claim cost him his job.",
    "The most interesting thing about this episode was not Mr Lemoine’s claim, which was probably false.",
    "Rather, it was his willingness to risk his lucrative job for the sake of the ai chatbot.",
    "If ai can influence people to risk their jobs for it, what else could it induce them to do?",
    "In a political battle for minds and hearts, intimacy is the most efficient weapon, and ai has just gained the ability to mass-produce intimate relationships with millions of people.",
    "We all know that over the past decade social media has become a battleground for controlling human attention.",
    "With the new generation of ai, the battlefront is shifting from attention to intimacy.",
    "What will happen to human society and human psychology as ai fights ai in a battle to fake intimate relationships with us, which can then be used to convince us to vote for particular politicians or buy particular products?",
    "Even without creating “fake intimacy”, the new ai tools would have an immense influence on our opinions and worldviews.",
    "People may come to use a single ai adviser as a one-stop, all- knowing oracle.",
    "No wonder Google is terrified.",
    "Why bother searching, when I can just ask the oracle?",
    "The news and advertising industries should also be terrified.",
    "Why read a newspaper when I can just ask the oracle to tell me the latest news?",
    "And what’s the purpose of advertisements, when I can just ask the oracle to tell me what to buy?",
    "And even these scenarios don’t really capture the big picture.",
    "What we are talking about is potentially the end of human history.",
    "Not the end of history, just the end of its human- dominated part.",
    "History is the interaction between biology and culture; between our biological needs and desires for things like food and sex, and our cultural creations like religions and laws.",
    "History is the process through which laws and religions shape food and sex.",
    "What will happen to the course of history when ai takes over culture, and begins producing stories, melodies, laws and religions?",
    "Previous tools like the printing press and radio helped spread the cultural ideas of humans, but they never created new cultural ideas of their own.",
    "ai is fundamentally different.",
    "ai can create completely new ideas, completely new culture.",
    "At first, ai will probably imitate the human prototypes that it was trained on in its infancy.",
    "But with each passing year, ai culture will boldly go where no human has gone before.",
    "For millennia human beings have lived inside the dreams of other humans.",
    "In the coming decades we might find ourselves living inside the dreams of an alien intelligence.",
    "Fear of ai has haunted humankind for only the past few decades.",
    "But for thousands of years humans have been haunted by a much deeper fear.",
    "We have always appreciated the power of stories and images to manipulate our minds and to create illusions.",
    "Consequently, since ancient times humans have feared being trapped in a world of illusions.",
    "In the 17th century René Descartes feared that perhaps a malicious demon was trapping him inside a world of illusions, creating everything he saw and heard.",
    "In ancient Greece Plato told the famous Allegory of the Cave, in which a group of people are chained inside a cave all their lives, facing a blank wall.",
    "A screen.",
    "On that screen they see projected various shadows.",
    "The prisoners mistake the illusions they see there for reality.",
    "In ancient India Buddhist and Hindu sages pointed out that all humans lived trapped inside Maya—the world of illusions.",
    "What we normally take to be reality is often just fictions in our own minds.",
    "People may wage entire wars, killing others and willing to be killed themselves, because of their belief in this or that illusion.",
    "The AI revolution is bringing us face to face with Descartes’ demon, with Plato’s cave, with the Maya.",
    "If we are not careful, we might be trapped behind a curtain of illusions, which we could not tear away—or even realise is there.",
    "Of course, the new power of ai could be used for good purposes as well.",
    "I won’t dwell on this, because the people who develop ai talk about it enough.",
    "The job of historians and philosophers like myself is to point out the dangers.",
    "But certainly, ai can help us in countless ways, from finding new cures for cancer to discovering solutions to the ecological crisis.",
    "The question we face is how to make sure the new ai tools are used for good rather than for ill.",
    "To do that, we first need to appreciate the true capabilities of these tools.",
    "Since 1945 we have known that nuclear technology could generate cheap energy for the benefit of humans—but could also physically destroy human civilisation.",
    "We therefore reshaped the entire international order to protect humanity, and to make sure nuclear technology was used primarily for good.",
    "We now have to grapple with a new weapon of mass destruction that can annihilate our mental and social world.",
    "We can still regulate the new ai tools, but we must act quickly.",
    "Whereas nukes cannot invent more powerful nukes, ai can make exponentially more powerful ai.",
    "The first crucial step is to demand rigorous safety checks before powerful ai tools are released into the public domain.",
    "Just as a pharmaceutical company cannot release new drugs before testing both their short- term and long-term side-effects, so tech companies shouldn’t release new ai tools before they are made safe.",
    "We need an equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration for new technology, and we need it yesterday.",
    "Won’t slowing down public deployments of ai cause democracies to lag behind more ruthless authoritarian regimes?",
    "Just the opposite.",
    "Unregulated ai deployments would create social chaos, which would benefit autocrats and ruin democracies.",
    "Democracy is a conversation, and conversations rely on language.",
    "When ai hacks language, it could destroy our ability to have meaningful conversations, thereby destroying democracy.",
    "We have just encountered an alien intelligence, here on Earth.",
    "We don’t know much about it, except that it might destroy our civilisation.",
    "We should put a halt to the irresponsible deployment of ai tools in the public sphere, and regulate ai before it regulates us.",
    "And the first regulation I would suggest is to make it mandatory for ai to disclose that it is an ai.",
    "If I am having a conversation with someone, and I cannot tell whether it is a human or an ai—that’s the end of democracy.",
    "This text has been generated by a human.",

    "Do you hear me now?",
    "Technology sometimes works.",
    "It’s a great pleasure for me to be here today with you and I would like to use this opportunity to talk to you about what the government can do about the AI revolution.",
    "The revolution of artificial intelligence will, in the coming decades, change the human economy, will change the political system, will even probably change our own bodies and minds and there is a lot of responsibility for governments to do something about the dangers inherent in this development.",
    "There are three particularly important things that governments should do.",
    "Governments should protect citizens from the economic shocks of the AI Revolution.",
    "Governments should protect citizens from the political dangers inherent in the AI Revolution and governments should also build global cooperation to help protect humanity as a whole, all over the world, from the existential threats that the AI Revolution poses to our species, to Homo Sapiens.",
    "So let’s begin with the first government task, which is to protect citizens from the economic shocks.",
    "Nobody really knows what the economy and the job market would look like in 2050.",
    "Except that they will be completely different from today.",
    "AI and robotics would likely change almost every profession.",
    "Many, if not most, jobs that people do today will disappear or change fundamentally by 2050.",
    "Of course, as old jobs disappear, new jobs are likely to emerge.",
    "But we don’t know if enough new jobs will emerge and the really big problem will be to retrain people to fill the new jobs.",
    "Suppose you’re a forty-years-old truck driver and you lose your job to a self-driving vehicle.",
    "There is a new job in designing computer code, or perhaps in teaching yoga.",
    "But how does a forty-years-old truck driver reinvents himself or herself as a yoga teacher or as a software engineer?",
    "And even if you do manage to retrain yourself to fill the new job, this will not be a long-term solution.",
    "Because the automation revolution will not be a single watershed event, in which the job market will settle down into some new equilibrium.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 12 Rather, it will be a cascade of ever bigger disruptions.",
    "It’s not that we’ll have the big AI Revolution by 2025 and then we have a couple of rough years when everybody adjusts and then it’s all over.",
    "No, we are nowhere near the full potential of AI.",
    "It’s just the beginning.",
    "So, we will have a major automation revolution by 2025.",
    "But then an even bigger one by 2035 and an even bigger one by 2045.",
    "All jobs will disappear.",
    "New jobs will emerge, but the new jobs too will constantly change and vanish.",
    "So, people will have to retrain and reinvent themselves, not just once, but over and over again throughout all their lives.",
    "Governments will probably have to step in and help people manage the difficult transition periods.",
    "Both by providing generous unemployment benefits and also by helping to by paying for all the retraining or adult education.",
    "Just to think, in the 20th century, governments built massive systems of education for the young.",
    "In the 21st century, they will have to build massive systems of education for adults.",
    "And even that, may not be enough.",
    "Because the biggest problem of all is likely to be psychological.",
    "Even if you have the financial support necessary to reinvent yourself at age 40, it’s unclear whether you will have the mental resilience.",
    "Change is always stressful.",
    "Reinventing yourself at age 40 and again at age 50 and again at age 60 might be too much for many people, too stressful.",
    "So even though it’s very clear that many new jobs will appear by 2050, we might nevertheless see the creation of a new class, a massive new class, the useless class.",
    "People who are useless, not from the viewpoint of the friends and family, nobody’s ever useless from the viewpoint of their loved ones, but rather, people who are useless from the viewpoint of the economic and political system.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 13",
    "In the past, people had to constantly struggle against exploitation.",
    "The big struggle in the 21st century might be the struggle against irrelevance.",
    "When confronting this crisis, the government’s motto should be “don’t protect the jobs, protect the people”.",
    "Help them retrain and reinvent themselves and find new jobs.",
    "If governments fail this mission, the result will be not only the concentration of wealth in very few hands, but also concentration of power in the hands of a tiny elite.",
    "If you think, for example, about the transportation market.",
    "So today, millions of taxi drivers and bus drivers and truck drivers own a small, each of them, owns a small share of the wealth and power of the transportation market.",
    "They earn their living from it and they can also unionize and go on strike to advance their interests.",
    "Now, fast forward 20 or 30 years and we might see a situation in which all this wealth and all this power is owned by a few billionaires who own the corporations, who own the algorithms that drive all the vehicles.",
    "So not just the wealth!",
    "Think about Uber without having to pay anything to any driver, because all the cars are self-driving.",
    "But also think about the billionaire who owns the company, that the workers cannot go on strike and paralyze the transportation market because algorithms never strike.",
    "But the billionaires, if something happens that they don’t like, they can press a button and immediately shut down the entire transportation market.",
    "The result might be the most unequal societies that ever existed.",
    "The AI Revolution might create unprecedented inequality not just between classes, but also between different countries.",
    "We are already in the midst of an AI arms race with the USA and China leading the race and most countries left far behind.",
    "If we aren’t careful, we’ll see a repetition of what happened in the 19th century with the industrial revolution.",
    "In the 19th century, a few countries, like Britain, France and Japan, industrialized first and they were then able to conquer, dominate and exploit the rest of the world.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 14",
    "The same thing might happen again in the 21st century with AI.",
    "Countries that don’t take action now, might lose control of their future.",
    "In 1840, Britain was building railroads and steamships.",
    "Many other countries said “we don’t care about steamships or railroads, we have much more urgent problems to deal with”.",
    "30 years later, these countries were British colonies.",
    "Nowadays, all countries, even the poorest ones, should care deeply about the AI race, because it is likely to shape their own economic and political futures.",
    "It is very likely that the AI Revolution will create immense new wealth in high tech hubs, like the United States and China, where the worst effects will be felt in developing countries.",
    "In the 20th century, developing countries could usually make economic progress by selling the cheap labor of their unskilled workers.",
    "But if automation reduces the demand for unskilled labor, and if developing countries lack the resources to retrain the workforce, what will they do in the 21st century?",
    "There will be more jobs for software engineers in California or Shanghai, but fewer jobs for textile workers and truck drivers in Honduras or in Bangladesh.",
    "Whenever people ask what will be the impact of AI on the economy or on the job market, you always have to remember, it will have very different impacts on different countries.",
    "It’s not going to be the same all over the world.",
    "The end result might be that most countries will be colonized by the leaders of the AI Revolution.",
    "Just as industrialization led to imperialism, so automation might lead to a new kind of imperialism or colonialism.",
    "In the 19th century, the industrial revolution in countries like Britain was fueled by exploiting the raw materials of many other countries around the world, like Brazil.",
    "This might happen again with data.",
    "Data is now the raw material of the AI Revolution and the vital data that is fueling the development in the United States, China and the other leading AI powers, is coming from all over the world.",
    "But the resulting power and wealth is usually not distributed back.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 15 Governments, in these countries, needs to take action now before it’s too late.",
    "The second important role of government is to protect citizens from the political dangers of the AI Revolution.",
    "The political threat can be summarized by a single equation, which might very well be the defining equation of the 21st century: B X C X D = AHH.",
    "Which means: biological knowledge multiplied by computing power multiplied by data equals the ability to hack humans.",
    "The merger of Infotech and biotech, which are technologies like biometric sensors, means that very soon, at least some governments and corporations will know enough biology, have enough computing power and will have enough data to systematically hack millions of people.",
    "What does it mean to hack humans?",
    "Means to create algorithms that understand us better than we understand ourselves.",
    "These algorithms can then predict our feelings and decisions, can manipulate our feelings and decisions and can ultimately make decisions for us or replace us all together.",
    "In order to do all that, the algorithms will not have to know us perfectly.",
    "That’s impossible.",
    "It’s impossible to know anything, let alone a human perfectly.",
    "But the algorithms will not need to be perfect.",
    "They will just need to know us better than we know ourselves, which is not impossible because most people don’t know themselves very well.",
    "Quite often, people don’t know the most important things about themselves.",
    "I know this for my own personal experience.",
    "It was only when I was 21 that I finally realized that I was gay, after living in denial for quite a number of years.",
    "I keep thinking about the time when I was 15 or 16",
    "and I asked myself how I could have missed it, should have been so obvious.",
    "I don’t know how, but the fact is that I did miss it, perhaps because I grew up in a very homophobic society.",
    "But that’s hardly exceptional.",
    "Lots of gay men spent their entire teenage years not knowing something very important about themselves.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 16 Now imagine the situation: in a few years when an algorithm can tell any teenager exactly where he or she is on the gay-straight spectrum just by collecting and analyzing data.",
    "One way to do it might be to track eye movements.",
    "The computer could track my eye movements and analyze what my eyes do when I see a sexy guy and a sexy girl walking in swimming suits on the beach.",
    "Where exactly do my eyes focus and where do they linger?",
    "As I walk down the beach, on the street, or as I surf the web or watch television, the algorithms could discreetly and continuously monitor me and analyze me and hack me in the service of the government or of some corporation.",
    "Maybe I still don’t know that I’m gay, but Coca-Cola already knows it.",
    "It knows it before me.",
    "So next time Coca-Cola shows me the advertisement for some new drink, it chooses to show me the version with the shirtless guy and not the version with the girl in the bikini.",
    "And the next day when I go to the store, I choose to buy Coke rather than Pepsi",
    "and I don’t even know why.",
    "But Coca-Cola will know and this information will be worth billions.",
    "This information could of course have far more serious consequences.",
    "In Iran, for example, there is a death penalty for homosexuality.",
    "What would it mean for a gay man in Iran to be detected and hacked by government algorithm?",
    "Everybody has some secrets.",
    "Of course, not everybody is gay, but everybody has some secrets.",
    "A lot of secrets worth knowing.",
    "To protect people against these dangers, governments should first and foremost restrain their own powers.",
    "In the 21st century, every government on Earth will face the temptation to build these total surveillance systems to monitor their own citizens.",
    "Even if you are not highly developed, you could always buy it from China or from the United States or from some other developed country.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 17 Governments must resist this temptation.",
    "Otherwise, the result will be the creation of the worst totalitarian regimes that ever existed.",
    "Regimes far worse even than Nazi Germany, of the USSR.",
    "Of course, it is not enough.",
    "For governments to restrain their own use of such technology, it’s also important for the government to protect its citizens from foreign governments and from foreign corporations, who might use this technology to hack their own citizens.",
    "Even if the government of Brazil does not create a total surveillance regime to monitor its citizens, Brazilian citizens might still fall victim to surveillance by the Chinese, American or Russian governments, or by big powerful corporations like Amazon, Baidu, Facebook or Alibaba.",
    "Just try to imagine again, fast-forward 20 or 30 years.",
    "Just try to imagine Brazilian politics in 2050.",
    "When somebody in Beijing or in San Francisco has the entire personal and medical records of every politician, journalist, judge, military officer, say people who are now 15 or 16 and live online and constantly monitored, in 30 years they are candidates in an election, or they are candidates for the Supreme Court, and somebody has their entire sexual record from when they were 20.",
    "The reputation of almost no person can survive this, so their fortunes, their future is in the hands of these outside systems.",
    "Whether the country is still independent under such a scenario or whether it became a data colony, it’s a difficult question.",
    "If you have enough data, you can control a country without needing to send armies and soldiers from abroad.",
    "To prevent this, governments need to regulate the ownership of data.",
    "Who owns my personal data?",
    "Who owns my medical data?",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 18",
    "For that we first need to realize the data is now the most important asset in the world.",
    "In ancient times, land was the most important asset.",
    "Politics was the struggle to control land.",
    "If too much of the land was concentrated in the hands of a single individual, like a big emperor or of a small aristocracy, then you got a dictatorship.",
    "In the last 200 years, machines and factories replaced land as the most important asset.",
    "Politics became the struggle to control the machines, and if too many of the machines were owned by the government or by a few corporations or a small elite, that was a modern dictatorship.",
    "Now, data is replacing both land and machinery as the most important asset in the world, and politics is increasingly becoming about controlling the flow of data in the world.",
    "If too much data is controlled by the government or by a few corporations, then we will see the emergence of a new kind of dictatorship: digital dictatorship.",
    "The problem is that we don’t really have a working model for regulating the ownership of data.",
    "We have thousands of years of experience regulating the ownership of land.",
    "We have a couple of centuries of experience in regulating the ownership of machines and factories and preventing overconcentration.",
    "But we have almost no experience in regulating the ownership of data.",
    "That’s a very great challenge to engineers, to lawyers, to philosophers.",
    "But above all to governments, because it is their job to regulate the ownership of data.",
    "It’s not something that we can rely on the corporations to do for us.",
    "After all, these corporations don’t really represent anybody, we didn’t vote for them.",
    "The countries that lag in the AI arms race obviously have the greatest incentive to regulate the ownership of data and the power of AI.",
    "To do so effectively, many countries will have to cooperate.",
    "By itself, Brazil will probably not be able to resist the USA, China, Google and Baidu.",
    "But if Brazil joins forces with other countries such as Argentina, South Africa, India, and the European Union, then such a block has a far better chance of regulating the ownership of data, as the development of surveillance technology in the AI across the world.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 19 That brings me to the third important mission of governments in the face of the AI Revolution.",
    "Governments should create effective global cooperation, because only global cooperation can deal with the existential threats that AI poses to humanity.",
    "As I mentioned, we need a global agreement on surveillance and the ownership of data.",
    "Similarly, we need a global safety net to protect all humans against the economic shocks that AI will likely unleash.",
    "Automation will create immense wealth in some countries while ruining other countries.",
    "Unless we find solutions on a global level to the disruptions caused by AI, then entire countries might collapse and the resulting caos, violence and waves of immigration will destabilize the entire world.",
    "The poorer countries will not be able to handle it by themselves.",
    "Global Cooperation is also necessary to prevent the development of dangerous new weapons, like autonomous weapon systems.",
    "No nation can do it by itself because no nation controls all the scientists and engineers in the world.",
    "If you think about the current arms race in developing autonomous weapons systems, killer robots, perhaps the most dangerous technology presently developed by the arms industry, almost every country will say this is a very dangerous technology Robots.",
    "We don’t want to develop it.",
    "We are the good guys.",
    "But we can’t trust our rivals not to do it, so we must do it first.",
    "We must do it before them.",
    "If we allow such an AI arms race to develop, it doesn’t matter who wins the arms race, the loser will be humanity.",
    "The only thing that can prevent such a dangerous arms race is not building walls between countries, which is currently in fashion.",
    "But rather building trust between countries, and that’s not impossible.",
    "If today, for example, the Germans come to the French and tell them “trust us, we aren’t building killer robots in some secret laboratory under the Alps”, the French are very likely to trust the Germans, despite the terrible history between these two countries.",
    "We need to build such trust globally.",
    "We need to reach a point when China and the US can trust each other like Germany and France.",
    "We are running in the opposite direction at the moment, but it’s not impossible.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 20 Technology poses a threat, a challenge.",
    "Not just to the global economy and to global peace, but also to the very meaning of humanity and to the most basic rules of life.",
    "For 4 billion years, nothing fundamental changed in the basic rules of the game of life.",
    "For 4 billion years, whether you were an amoeba or a dinosaur, a tomato or a homo sapiens, you were subject to the rules of organic biochemistry because you were made of organic compounds and you evolved according to the rules of natural selection.",
    "These were the two rule systems that every organism was subject to.",
    "Organic biochemistry and natural selection.",
    "But in the 21st century, natural selection is likely to be replaced by intelligent design.",

    "But given that, I’ll ask you this question.",
    "Should the government innovate less?",
    "We are in the week of innovation in public service and a lot of what we’ve been discussing for the past few days is exactly how to introduce new technology to the government.",
    "Is that a threat, however, to society?",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 25 YUVAL:",
    "No, I mean, you need to adapt to the changing conditions of the private market of society.",
    "It’s very dangerous if the government does not innovate and remains behind because it has a very crucial role it needs to regulate all these new technologies and for that it needs to understand them.",
    "Of course we should also expect the corporations and the engineers who are developing the new technologies to be responsible in how they do it.",
    "But ultimately, the real responsibility is of the government because it has the power to do so and it has the mandate from the citizens.",
    "We didn’t vote for the engineers.",
    "We didn’t vote for the entrepreneurs or for the billionaires who owned their corporations.",
    "We vote for the government in the hope that it will protect the interests of the citizens in this fast changing world.",
    "DIOGO:",
    "I think there’s a question about what kind of stories that we should tell ourselves and someone is asking if the tale of pessimism - and I don’t think you consider yourself a pessimist -, but if the tale of pessimism also can bring bad consequences to society, to how we see ourselves and if we should have a story of aspiration of optimism somehow.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 26 YUVAL HARARI:",
    "I think we should be realistic above all.",
    "I mean pessimism, yes, I mean, if you just go and spread prophecies of Doom and say there is nothing we can do, then this causes despair.",
    "When I go and give such talks in different places, I focus on the negative scenarios.",
    "Largely because there is a division of labor in the Academy, in scholarship.",
    "You know you have all the engineers and the people in the computer science department and the entrepreneurs developing these technologies.",
    "So naturally, they focus on all the positive potential outcomes and all the promises, especially if you need to raise investment for your startup, you won’t go and tell the investors all the terrible things that can happen from your invention.",
    "Because they focus mostly on the positive scenario, it becomes the job of historians, philosophers and social critics to warn people about the dangerous scenarios.",
    "But not in a kind of doomsday prophecy that we are all lost.",
    "There is nothing to do but just to raise alarm about dangerous possibilities in the hope that we take action to prevent them.",
    "I focused a lot, for example, in the use of AI to create surveillance regimes.",
    "But AI can be used in different ways.",
    "The same technology can be used by dictatorial governments and big corporations to monitor the citizens and the customers, but you can develop the technology that works the other way, that monitors the corporations and the government in the service of the citizens.",
    "AI can work both ways.",
    "For example, if you think about a problem like corruption in government.",
    "Let’s say that the politicians appoint their relatives and cousins to all the jobs.",
    "For a private citizen, to monitor that it’s very difficult, even if I have legal access to the information, I don’t have the time and ability to go over all the names and see who is related to whom and so forth.",
    "But if you build the right AI system, technically it’s extremely easy to build an AI system that simply monitors who is appointed in the civil service and the government should be open knowledge to the public, and so it’s quite easy to know who is related to whom, in what way, and as a private citizen, you can just go to the computer, type the name of a politician or Minister or whatever, and immediately see all the relatives he or she appointed and compare different politicians for example.",
    "AI can also do that.",
    "In most dictatorial regimes you will never encounter such a tool.",
    "But it depends on what kind of technology to develop and how to use it.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 27 DIOGO:",
    "Do you think that, in an opposite sense, big tech should be favored over smaller startups, given that big techs are usually easier to regulate and control, they are more responsive to social control and to government control?",
    "Facebook is easier to manage than 4Chan or 8Chan and they’re usually also less innovative.",
    "Facebook and Google have been innovating by buying smaller startups.",
    "Do you think that there should be a higher entry barrier for startups and that the government should have policies that favor those well manageable, bigger companies?",
    "YUVAL HARARI:",
    "Of course there are also huge dangers to the big corporations, both by lobbying and undermining government, or even taking over governments.",
    "Also the enormous concentration of data in power in one place is extremely dangerous.",
    "I don’t think that there is an inherent vantage or that the government should prefer the tech leviathans over the small new companies.",
    "The key is really not the size, but the policies.",
    "Again, here the problem is that the government, I think, never encountered this problem to such an extent.",
    "Technology changes so fast.",
    "By the time that the government understands the new technology, its implications, thinks about regulation and then you have to pass legislation.",
    "By the time all this process is complete, the technology has changed three or four times.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 28",
    "The regulations may not be relevant anymore.",
    "For instance, one danger that we are facing - in all countries, not just dictatorial countries, also in free democratic countries - is that more and more decisions about our lives will be, and already are taken, by algorithms.",
    "I don’t know how it is in Brazil, but in many countries you apply to the bank to get a loan and your application is not processed by a human banker, it’s processed by an algorithm.",
    "The algorithm decides whether to give you a loan or not.",
    "Let’s say the algorithm said no, don’t give this person a loan.",
    "You go to the bank and you ask “why not, what’s wrong with me?” and the bank says “we don’t know, the algorithm said no",
    "and we trust our algorithm.”",
    "This is extremely dangerous because it means people are losing control over their lives.",
    "There could be so many biases written into the algorithm.",
    "We already have racist algorithms, sometimes unintentionally.",
    "One famous example was a self- driving car, an algorithm for a self-driving car, developed in Silicon Valley lately.",
    "It turned out that it recognizes white pedestrians more easily than black pedestrians.",
    "Why?",
    "Because the data it trained on driving around Mountain View and all these places in Silicon, there are very few black pedestrians there.",
    "Eventually it means that it is 10% worse at recognizing black pedestrians, which could in some future lead to greater fatality, more accidents.",
    "It’s not even intentional.",
    "But how do we know if the algorithm is biased, say racially?",
    "The EU has just passed a regulation or legislation that says that citizens have a right for explanation.",
    "If your fate, like a bank loan, if the decision was taken by an algorithm, you have the right to get an explanation from the bank.",
    "The bank can’t just say “oh the algorithm said no.”",
    "But here is the problem with the development of technology.",
    "It sounds good on paper.",
    "But the bank then just can say “ok, we can give you the explanation, here are 1,000,000 pages, a print out of all the data that the algorithm collected on you and based on that it found patterns and comparing you to a million other people, it reached the conclusion that you are not creditworthy”.",
    "The thing is that algorithms just make decisions in a very different way than humans.",
    "A human banker, when it makes a decision, usually takes into account just four or five salient features.",
    "ENAP Collection 2022 - English version Government and IA - Yuval Harari 29 Could be relevant features like your past credit history; could be a biased feature, like your race or gender.",
    "But humans can’t take hundreds of factors into account.",
    "The big advantage of AI is that it is able to make a decision based on hundreds of different factors.",
    "Just giving people the right to an explanation, if you don’t understand how the technology works, this legislation is really irrelevant.",

    "But then, instead of coming here by airplane, maybe in 20 years I can just be here as an hologram, as an avatar, and save the entire transport cost, the pollution and so forth.",
    "The thought that the progress should be linear - we invented an airplane and now there should be faster and faster and faster airplanes - it usually doesn’t work like that.",

    "The one thing they will need for sure is the ability to retrain themselves, reinvent themselves, and adapt to completely unknown situations and problems.",
    "I would say that the emphasis should be on that.",
    "The assumption that, if you teach a course on anything and you teach certain examples and skills, the assumption should be that by 2050 this may be completely irrelevant.",

    "Fears of machines pushing people out of the job market are, of course, nothing new, and in the past such fears proved to be unfounded.",
    "But artificial intelligence is different from the old machines.",
    "In the past, machines competed with humans mainly in manual skills.",
    "Now they are beginning to compete with us in cognitive skills.",
    "And we don’t know of any third kind of skill—beyond the manual and the cognitive—in which humans will always have an edge.",
    "At least for a few more decades, human intelligence is likely to far ex- ceed computer intelligence in numerous fields.",
    "Hence as computers take over more routine cognitive jobs, new creative jobs for humans will continue to appear.",
    "Many of these new jobs will probably depend on cooperation rather than competition between humans and AI.",
    "Human-AI teams will likely prove superior not just to humans, but also to computers working on their own.",
    "However, most of the new jobs will presumably demand high levels of expertise and ingenuity, and therefore may not provide an answer to the problem of unemployed unskilled laborers, or workers employable only at ex- tremely low wages.",
    "Moreover, as AI continues to improve, even jobs that de- mand high intelligence and creativity might gradually disappear.",
    "The world of chess serves as an example of where things might be heading.",
    "For several years after IBM’s computer Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997, hu- man chess players still flourished; AI was used to train human prodigies, and teams composed of humans plus computers proved superior to computers playing alone.",
    "Yet in recent years, computers have become so good at playing chess that their human collaborators have lost their value and might soon become en- tirelyirrelevant.",
    "OnDecember6,2017,anothercrucialmilestonewasreached when Google’s AlphaZero program defeated the Stockfish 8 program.",
    "Stock- fish 8 had won a world computer chess championship in 2016.",
    "It had access to centuries of accumulated human experience in chess, as well as decades of computer experience.",
    "By contrast, AlphaZero had not been taught any chess strategies by its human creators—not even standard openings.",
    "Rather, it used the latest machine-learning principles to teach itself chess by play- ing against itself.",
    "Nevertheless, out of 100 games that the novice AlphaZero playedagainstStockfish8,AlphaZerowon28andtied72—itdidn’tloseonce.",
    "Since AlphaZero had learned nothing from any human, many of its winning 3 moves and strategies seemed unconventional to the human eye.",
    "They could be described as creative, if not downright genius.",
    "Can you guess how long AlphaZero spent learning chess from scratch, preparing for the match against Stockfish 8, and developing its genius in- stincts?",
    "Four hours.",
    "For centuries, chess was considered one of the crowning glories of human intelligence.",
    "AlphaZero went from utter ignorance to cre- ative mastery in four hours, without the help of any human guide.",
    "AlphaZero is not the only imaginative software out there.",
    "One of the ways to catch cheaters in chess tournaments today is to monitor the level of originality that players exhibit.",
    "If they play an exceptionally creative move, the judges will often suspect that it could not possibly be a human move—it must be a computer move.",
    "At least in chess, creativity is already considered to be the trademark of computers rather than humans!",
    "So if chess is our canary in the coal mine, we have been duly warned that the canary is dying.",
    "What is happening today to human-AI teams in chess might happen down the road to human-AI teams in policing, medicine, banking, and many other fields.",
    "What’s more, AI enjoys uniquely nonhuman abilities, which makes the difference between AI and a human worker one of kind rather than merely of degree.",
    "Two particularly important nonhuman abilities that AI possesses are connectivity and updatability.",
    "For example, many drivers are unfamiliar with all the changing traffic regulations on the roads they drive, and they often violate them.",
    "In addi- tion, since every driver is a singular entity, when two vehicles approach the same intersection, the drivers sometimes miscommunicate their intentions and collide.",
    "Self-driving cars, by contrast, will know all the traffic regula- tions and never disobey them on purpose, and they could all be connected to one another.",
    "When two such vehicles approach the same junction, they won’t really be two separate entities, but part of a single algorithm.",
    "The chances that they might miscommunicate and collide will therefore be far smaller.",
    "Similarly, if the World Health Organization identifies a new disease, or if a laboratory produces a new medicine, it can’t immediately update all the human doctors in the world.",
    "Yet even if you had billions of AI doctors in the world—each monitoring the health of a single human being—you could still update all of them within a split second, and they could all communicate to oneanothertheirassessmentsofthenewdiseaseormedicine.",
    "Thesepotential advantages of connectivity and updatability are so huge that at least in some 4 lines of work, it might make sense to replace all humans with computers, even if individually some humans still do a better job than the machines.",
    "The same technologies that might make billions of people economically irrelevant might also make them easier to monitor and control.",
    "All of this leads to one very important conclusion: The automation revo- lution will not consist of a single watershed event, after which the job market will settle into some new equilibrium.",
    "Rather, it will be a cascade of ever bigger disruptions.",
    "Old jobs will disappear and new jobs will emerge, but the new jobs will also rapidly change and vanish.",
    "People will need to retrain and reinvent themselves not just once, but many times.",
    "Just as in the 20th century governments established massive education systems for young people, in the 21st century they will need to establish massive reeducation systems for adults.",
    "But will that be enough?",
    "Change is always stressful, and the hectic world of the early 21st century has produced a global epidemic of stress.",
    "As job volatility increases, will people be able to cope?",
    "By 2050, a useless class might emerge, the result not only of a shortage of jobs or a lack of relevant education but also of insufficient mental stamina to continue learning new skills.",
    "III.",
    "The Rise of Digital Dictatorships As many people lose their economic value, they might also come to lose their political power.",
    "The same technologies that might make billions of people economically irrelevant might also make them easier to monitor and control.",
    "AI frightens many people because they don’t trust it to remain obe- dient.",
    "Science fiction makes much of the possibility that computers or robots will develop consciousness—and shortly thereafter will try to kill all humans.",
    "But there is no particular reason to believe that AI will develop conscious- ness as it becomes more intelligent.",
    "We should instead fear AI because it will probably always obey its human masters, and never rebel.",
    "AI is a tool and a weapon unlike any other that human beings have developed; it will almost certainly allow the already powerful to consolidate their power further.from the atlantic archives March 1992",

    "Read more Consider surveillance.",
    "Numerous countries around the world, including severaldemocracies, arebusybuildingunprecedentedsystemsofsurveillance.",
    "For example, Israel is a leader in the field of surveillance technology, and has created in the occupied West Bank a working prototype for a total- surveillance regime.",
    "Already today whenever Palestinians make a phone call, post something on Facebook, or travel from one city to another, they are likely to be monitored by Israeli microphones, cameras, drones, or spy software.",
    "Algorithms analyze the gathered data, helping the Israeli security forces pinpoint and neutralize what they consider to be potential threats.",
    "The Palestinians may administer some towns and villages in the West Bank, but the Israelis command the sky, the airwaves, and cyberspace.",
    "It therefore takes surprisingly few Israeli soldiers to effectively control the roughly 2.5 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank.",
    "In one incident in October 2017, a Palestinian laborer posted to his private Facebook account a picture of himself in his workplace, alongside a bulldozer.",
    "Adjacent to the image he wrote, “Good morning!”",
    "A Facebook translation algorithm made a small error when transliterating the Arabic letters.",
    "Instead of Ysabechhum (which means “Good morning”), the algorithm identified the letters as Ydbachhum (which means “Hurt them”).",
    "Suspecting that the man might be a terrorist intending to use a bulldozer to run people over, Israeli security forces swiftly arrested him.",
    "They released him after they realized that the algorithm had made a mistake.",
    "Even so, the offending Facebook post was taken down—you can never be too careful.",
    "What Palestinians are experiencing today in the West Bank may be just a primitive preview of what billions of people will eventually experience all over the planet.",
    "Imagine, for instance, that the current regime in North Korea gained a more advanced version of this sort of technology in the future.",
    "North Kore- ans might be required to wear a biometric bracelet that monitors everything they do and say, as well as their blood pressure and brain activity.",
    "Using the growing understanding of the human brain and drawing on the immense powers of machine learning, the North Korean government might eventually be able to gauge what each and every citizen is thinking at each and every moment.",
    "If a North Korean looked at a picture of Kim Jong Un and the biometric sensors picked up telltale signs of anger (higher blood pressure, in- creased activity in the amygdala), that person could be in the gulag the next day.",
    "The conflict between democracy and dictatorship is actually a conflict between two different data-processing systems.",
    "AI may swing the advantage 6 toward the latter.",
    "And yet such hard-edged tactics may not prove necessary, at least much of the time.",
    "A facade of free choice and free voting may remain in place in some countries, even as the public exerts less and less actual control.",
    "To be sure, attempts to manipulate voters’ feelings are not new.",
    "But once somebody (whether in San Francisco or Beijing or Moscow) gains the tech- nological ability to manipulate the human heart—reliably, cheaply, and at scale—democratic politics will mutate into an emotional puppet show.",
    "We are unlikely to face a rebellion of sentient machines in the coming decades,butwemighthavetodealwithhordesofbotsthatknowhowtopress ouremotionalbuttonsbetterthanourmotherdoesandthatusethisuncanny ability, at the behest of a human elite, to try to sell us something—be it a car, a politician, or an entire ideology.",
    "The bots might identify our deepest fears, hatreds, and cravings and use them against us.",
    "We have already been given a foretaste of this in recent elections and referendums across the world, when hackers learned how to manipulate individual voters by analyzing data about them and exploiting their prejudices.",
    "While science-fiction thrillers are drawn to dramatic apocalypses of fire and smoke, in reality we may be facing a banal apocalypse by clicking.",
    "The biggest and most frightening impact of the AI revolution might be on the relative efficiency of democracies and dictatorships.",
    "Historically, autoc- racies have faced crippling handicaps in regard to innovation and economic growth.",
    "In the late 20th century, democracies usually outperformed dicta- torships, because they were far better at processing information.",
    "We tend to think about the conflict between democracy and dictatorship as a conflict between two different ethical systems, but it is actually a conflict between two different data-processing systems.",
    "Democracy distributes the power to processinformationandmakedecisionsamongmanypeopleandinstitutions, whereasdictatorshipconcentratesinformationandpowerinoneplace.",
    "Given 20th-century technology, it was inefficient to concentrate too much informa- tion and power in one place.",
    "Nobody had the ability to process all available information fast enough and make the right decisions.",
    "This is one reason the Soviet Union made far worse decisions than the United States, and why the Soviet economy lagged far behind the American economy.",
    "However, artificial intelligence may soon swing the pendulum in the op- posite direction.",
    "AI makes it possible to process enormous amounts of in- formation centrally.",
    "In fact, it might make centralized systems far more efficient than diffuse systems, because machine learning works better when 7 the machine has more information to analyze.",
    "If you disregard all privacy concerns and concentrate all the information relating to a billion people in one database, you’ll wind up with much better algorithms than if you respect individual privacy and have in your database only partial information on a million people.",
    "An authoritarian government that orders all its citizens to have their DNA sequenced and to share their medical data with some central authority would gain an immense advantage in genetics and medical research over societies in which medical data are strictly private.",
    "The main handicap of authoritarian regimes in the 20th century—the desire to concentrate all information and power in one place—may become their decisive advantage in the 21st century.",
    "Yoshi SodeokaNew technologies will continue to emerge, of course, and some of them may encourage the distribution rather than the concentration of information and power.",
    "Blockchain technology, and the use of cryptocurrencies enabled by it, is currently touted as a possible counter- weight to centralized power.",
    "But blockchain technology is still in the embry- onic stage, and we don’t yet know whether it will indeed counterbalance the centralizing tendencies of AI.",
    "Remember that the Internet, too, was hyped in its early days as a libertarian panacea that would free people from all centralized systems—but is now poised to make centralized authority more powerful than ever.",
    "IV.",
    "The Transfer of Authority to Machines Even if some societies remain ostensibly democratic, the increasing effi- ciency of algorithms will still shift more and more authority from individual humans to networked machines.",
    "We might willingly give up more and more authority over our lives because we will learn from experience to trust the algorithms more than our own feelings, eventually losing our ability to make many decisions for ourselves.",
    "Just think of the way that, within a mere two decades, billions of people have come to entrust Google’s search algorithm with one of the most important tasks of all: finding relevant and trustworthy information.",
    "As we rely more on Google for answers, our ability to locate information independently diminishes.",
    "Already today, “truth” is defined by the top results of a Google search.",
    "This process has likewise affected our physical abilities, such as navigating space.",
    "People ask Google not just to find information but also to guide them around.",
    "Self-driving cars and AI physicians would represent further erosion: While these innovations would put truckers and human doctors out of work, their larger import lies in the continuing transfer of authority and responsibility to machines.",
    "8 Humans are used to thinking about life as a drama of decision mak- ing.",
    "Liberal democracy and free-market capitalism see the individual as an autonomous agent constantly making choices about the world.",
    "Works of art—be they Shakespeare plays, Jane Austen novels, or cheesy Hollywood comedies—usually revolve around the hero having to make some crucial de- cision.",
    "To be or not to be?",
    "To listen to my wife and kill King Duncan, or listen to my conscience and spare him?",
    "To marry Mr. Collins or Mr. Darcy?",
    "Christian and Muslim theology similarly focus on the drama of deci- sion making, arguing that everlasting salvation depends on making the right choice.",
    "What will happen to this view of life as we rely on AI to make ever more decisionsforus?",
    "EvennowwetrustNetflixtorecommendmoviesandSpotify to pick music we’ll like.",
    "But why should AI’s helpfulness stop there?Every year millions of college students need to decide what to study.",
    "This is a very important and difficult decision, made under pressure from parents, friends, and professors who have varying interests and opinions.",
    "It is also influenced by students’ own individual fears and fantasies, which are themselves shaped by movies, novels, and advertising campaigns.",
    "Complicating matters, a given student does not really know what it takes to succeed in a given profession, and doesn’t necessarily have a realistic sense of his or her own strengths and weaknesses.",
    "It’s not so hard to see how AI could one day make better decisions than we do about careers, and perhaps even about relationships.",
    "But once we begin to count on AI to decide what to study, where to work, and whom to date or even marry, human life will cease to be a drama of decision making, and our conception of life will need to change.",
    "Democratic elections and free markets might cease to make sense.",
    "So might most religions and works of art.",
    "Imagine Anna Karenina taking out her smartphone and asking Siri whether she should stay married to Karenin or elope with the dashing Count Vronsky.",
    "Or imagine your favorite Shakespeare play with all the crucial de- cisions made by a Google algorithm.",
    "Hamlet and Macbeth would have much more comfortable lives, but what kind of lives would those be?",
    "Do we have models for making sense of such lives?Can parliaments and political parties overcome these challenges and forestall the darker scenarios?",

    "Technological disruption is not even a leading item on the political agenda.",
    "During the 2016 U.S. presidential race, themainreferencetodisruptivetechnologyconcernedHillaryClinton’semail debacle, and despite all the talk about job loss, neither candidate directly 9 addressed the potential impact of automation.",
    "Donald Trump warned voters that Mexicans would take their jobs, and that the U.S. should therefore build a wall on its southern border.",
    "He never warned voters that algorithms would take their jobs, nor did he suggest building a firewall around California.",
    "So what should we do?",
    "For starters, we need to place a much higher priority on understanding how the human mind works—particularly how our own wisdom and compassion can be cultivated.",
    "If we invest too much in AI and too little in developing the human mind, the very sophisticated artificial intelligence of computers might serve only to empower the natural stupidity of humans, and to nurture our worst (but also, perhaps, most powerful) impulses, amongthemgreedandhatred.",

    "In the modern era, machines and factories became more important than land, so political struggles focused on controlling these vital means of production.",

    "The race to accumulate data is already on, and is currently headed by giants such as Google and Facebook and, in China, Baidu and Tencent.",
    "So far, many of these companies have acted as “attention merchants”—they capture our attention by providing us with free information, services, and entertainment, and then they resell our attention to advertisers.",
    "Yet their true business isn’t merely selling ads.",
    "Rather, by capturing our attention they manage to accumulate immense amounts of data about us, which are worth more than any advertising revenue.",

    "Atpresent, many of us are happy to give away our most valuable asset—our personal 10 data—in exchange for free email services and funny cat videos.",
    "But if, later on, ordinary people decide to try to block the flow of data, they are likely to have trouble doing so, especially as they may have come to rely on the network to help them make decisions, and even for their health and physical survival.",
    "Nationalization of data by governments could offer one solution; it would certainly curb the power of big corporations.",
    "But history suggests that we are not necessarily better off in the hands of overmighty governments.",
    "So we had better call upon our scientists, our philosophers, our lawyers, and even our poets to turn their attention to this big question: How do you regulate the ownership of data?",

    "If we are not careful, we will end up with downgraded humans misusing upgraded com- puters to wreak havoc on themselves and on the world.",
    "If you find these prospects alarming—if you dislike the idea of living in a digital dictatorship or some similarly degraded form of society—then the most important contribution you can make is to find ways to prevent too much data from being concentrated in too few hands, and also find ways to keep distributed data processing more efficient than centralized data processing.",
    "These will not be easy tasks.",
    "But achieving them may be the best safeguard of democracy.",
